These exceptions may either be relics of a less strict use of the name Elohim, or they may be errors of copyists, misled by the ordinary rules of grammar. This latter view is confirmed by the fact that the Samaritan Pentateuch, both here and in <a href="/genesis/35-7.htm" title="And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.">Genesis 35:7</a>, has the singular.<p><span class= "bld">At every place.</span>—The fact of this compact between Abraham and Sarah having been made so long before, would convince Abimelech that their conduct was not occasioned by anything which they had seen at Gerar (comp. <a href="/genesis/20-10.htm" title="And Abimelech said to Abraham, What saw you, that you have done this thing?">Genesis 20:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/20-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.">Genesis 20:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">When God caused me to wander from my father’s house — </span>Then we settled this matter.

Mark his distrust of God, his undue care about life, his intent to deceive. He also threw temptation in the way of others, caused affliction to them, exposed himself and Sarah to just rebukes, and yet attempted an excuse. These things are written for our warning, not for us to imitate. Even Abraham hath not whereof to glory. He cannot be justified by his works, but must be indebted for justification, to that righteousness which is upon all and unto all them that believe. We must not condemn all as hypocrites who fall into sin, if they do not continue in it. But let the unhumbled and impenitent take heed that they do not sin on, thinking that grace may abound. Abimelech, being warned of God, takes the warning; and being truly afraid of sin and its consequences, he rose early to pursue the directions given him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abimelek retraces his steps, and rectifies his conduct. He makes known his dream to his assembled court, who are filled with astonishment and apprehension. He then calls Abraham, and in bold and manly style remonstrates with him for leading him into error and sin. Abraham is apparently silent from confusion and self-condemnation. Abimelek, after a pause, demands of him his reason for so doing. Abraham now replies with great simplicity and candor. He had said within himself, "The fear of God is not in this place." This is another indication that polytheism was setting in. He concluded that his life would be in danger on account of his wife, and resorted to his wonted expedient for safety. He had learned to trust in the Lord in all things; but he did not think this inconsistent with using all lawful means for personal security, and he was not yet fully alive to the unlawfulness of his usual pretence. He pleads also in extenuation that she is in reality his sister (see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-19.htm">Genesis 12:19-20</a>). "Caused me to wander." The verb here is not necessarily plural. But if it be, it is only an instance of the literal, meaning of &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym, the Eternal Supernatural Powers, coming into view. "Thy kindness." The old compact of Abraham with Sarah tended to palliate his conduct in the eyes of Abimelek, as he would see that it had no special reference to himself.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. yet indeed she is my sister&#8212;(See on [8]Ge 11:31). What a poor defense Abraham made. The statement absolved him from the charge of direct and absolute falsehood, but he had told a moral untruth because there was an intention to deceive (compare Ge 12:11-13). "Honesty is always the best policy." Abraham's life would have been as well protected without the fraud as with it: and what shame to himself, what distrust to God, what dishonor to religion might have been prevented!

This plea was admitted by God, who told him that He had kept him from sinning through touching Sarah, and commanded him to restore the woman immediately to her husband, who was a prophet, that he might pray for him and save his life, and threatened him with certain death to himself and all belonging to him in case he should refuse. That Abimelech, when taking the supposed sister of Abraham into his harem, should have thought that he was acting "in innocence of heart and purity of hands," i.e., in perfect innocence, is to be fully accounted for, from his undeveloped moral and religious standpoint, by considering the customs of that day. But that God should have admitted that he had acted "in innocence of heart," and yet should have proceeded at once to tell him that he could only remain alive through the intercession of Abraham, that is to say, through his obtaining forgiveness of a sin that was deserving of death, is a proof that God treated him as capable of deeper moral discernment and piety. The history itself indicates this in the very characteristic variation in the names of God. First of all (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>), Elohim (without the article, i.e., Deity generally) appears to him in a dream; but Abimelech recognises the Lord, Adonai, i.e., God (<a href="/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a>); whereupon the historian represents &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (Elohim with the article), the personal and true God, as speaking to him. The address of God, too, also shows his susceptibility of divine truth. Without further pointing out to him the wrong which he had done in simplicity of heart, in taking the sister of the stranger who had come into his land, for the purpose of increasing his own harem, since he must have been conscious of this himself, God described Abraham as a prophet, whose intercession alone could remove his guilt, to show him the way of salvation. A prophet: lit., the God-addressed or inspired, since the "inward speaking" (Ein-sprache) or inspiration of God constitutes the essence of prophecy. Abraham was &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; as the recipient of divine revelation, and was thereby placed in so confidential a relation to God, that he could intercede for sinners, and atone for sins of infirmity through his intercession. </body></html>
