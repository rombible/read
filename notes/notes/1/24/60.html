Lingering and loitering no way become a wise and good man who is faithful to his duty. As children ought not to marry without their parents' consent, so parents ought not to marry them without their own. Rebekah consented, not only to go, but to go at once. The goodness of Rebekah's character shows there was nothing wrong in her answer, though it be not agreeable to modern customs among us. We may hope that she had such an idea of the religion and godliness in the family she was to go to, as made her willing to forget her own people and her father's house. Her friends dismiss her with suitable attendants, and with hearty good wishes. They blessed Rebekah. When our relations are entering into a new condition, we ought by prayer to commend them to the blessing and grace of God. Isaac was well employed when he met Rebekah. He went out to take the advantage of a silent evening, and a solitary place, for meditation and prayer; those divine exercises by which we converse with God and our own hearts. Holy souls love retirement; it will do us good to be often alone, if rightly employed; and we are never less alone than when alone. Observe what an affectionate son Isaac was: it was about three years since his mother died, and yet he was not, till now, comforted. See also what an affectionate husband he was to his wife. Dutiful sons promise fair to be affectionate husbands; he that fills up his first station in life with honour, is likely to do the same in those that follow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The servant's return with Rebekah. So plain an interposition of Providence admits of no refusal on the part of those who revere the Lord. Bethuel now appears as a concurring party. Laban, as the full brother of Rebekah, has a voice in the disposal of her hand; but the father only has the power to ratify the contract. The patriarch's servant first bows in acknowledgment to the Lord, who had now manifested his approval of the choice he had made, and then proceeds to distribute costly gifts to the bride, and to her brother and mother. Now at length the thankful guest partakes of the fare set before him along with his entertainers, and after the night's repose requests to be dismissed. "A few days;" perhaps a week or ten days. The mother and brother naturally plead for a little time to prepare for parting with Rebekah. They could not expect the servant, however, to stay months.<p>"Inquire at her mouth." This is the only free choice in the matter that seems to be given to Rebekah. Her consent may have been modestly indicated, before her family ratified the contract. It is plain, however, that it was thought proper that the parents should receive and decide upon a proposal of marriage. The extent to which the maiden's inclinations would be consulted would depend very much on the custom of the country, and the intelligence and good feeling of the parents. In later times the custom became very arbitrary. Rebekah's decision shows that she concurred in the consent of her relatives. "And her nurse." Her name, we learn afterward <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>, was Deborah. The nurse accompanied the bride as her confidential adviser and faithful attendant, and died in her service; a beautiful trait of ancient manners. The blessing consists in a boundless offspring, and the upper hand over their enemies. These are indicative of a thin population, and a comparatively rude state of society. "And her damsels." We here learn, again, incidentally, that Rebekah had more female attendants than her nurse.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53.

That is, her parents and her friends, they wished the best and choicest of blessings might descend upon her: <p>and said unto her, thou art our sister; the Targum of Jonathan is,"hitherto thou hast been our sister,''as if the relation now ceased, having entered into another; and especially as she was going away from them into a distant country, and might never see her more, it was as if she was no more to them or to be enjoyed by them: <p>be thou the mother of thousands of millions; as she was, the Edomites and Israelites both springing from her: <p>and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them; exercise dominion and authority over their enemies: let them not only be numerous, but powerful and victorious, as both the nations were at times, and especially the latter; and particularly this had its accomplishment in Christ, who sprung from her in the line of Jacob, <a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>; some respect seems to be had to the promise made to Abraham, <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; of which this family might have knowledge from Abraham's servant, who might report not only how great his master was, but what promises were made to him with respect to his posterity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou <i>art</i> our sister, be thou <i>the mother</i> of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> gate of those which hate them.</span><p>(d) That is, let them be victorious over their enemies: a blessing that is fully accomplished through Jesus Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">60</span>. <span class="ital">And they blessed Rebekah</span>] The farewell blessing and good wishes of the family referred in Oriental fashion to the two objects of desire, (1) that she should be the mother of many descendants; and (2) that they should be victorious over their enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">possess the gate of</span>] Cf. <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>. “The possessors of the gate” were the controllers of the affairs of the city.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The next morning he desired at once to set off on the journey home; but her brother and mother wished to keep her with them &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512; &#1488;&#1493; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "some days, or rather ten;" but when she was consulted, she decided to so, sc., without delay. "Then they sent away Rebekah their sister (Laban being chiefly considered, as the leading person in the affair) and her nurse" (Deborah; <a href="/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>), with the parting wish that she might become the mother of an exceedingly numerous and victorious posterity. "Become thousands of myriads" is a hyperbolical expression for an innumerable host of children.
