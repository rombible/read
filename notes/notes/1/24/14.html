It is the comfort, as well as the belief, of a good man, that God’s providence extends itself to the smallest occurrences, and admirably serves its own purposes by them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:10-28 Abraham's servant devoutly acknowledged God. We have leave to be particular in recommending our affairs to the care of Divine providence. He proposes a sign, not that he intended to proceed no further, if not gratified in it; but it is a prayer that God would provide a good wife for his young master; and that was a good prayer. She should be simple, industrious, humble, cheerful, serviceable, and hospitable. Whatever may be the fashion, common sense, as well as piety, tells us, these are the proper qualifications for a wife and mother; for one who is to be a companion to her husband, the manager of domestic concerns, and trusted to form the minds of children. When the steward came to seek a wife for his master, he did not go to places of amusement and sinful pleasure, and pray that he might meet one there, but to the well of water, expecting to find one there employed aright. He prayed that God would please to make his way in this matter plain and clear before him. Our times are in God's hand; not only events themselves, but the times of them. We must take heed of being over-bold in urging what God should do, lest the event should weaken our faith, rather than strengthen it. But God owned him by making his way clear. Rebekah, in all respects, answered the characters he sought for in the woman that was to be his master's wife. When she came to the well, she went down and filled her pitcher, and came up to go home with it. She did not stand to gaze upon the strange man his camels, but minded her business, and would not have been diverted from it but by an opportunity of doing good. She did not curiously or confidently enter into discourse with him, but answered him modestly. Being satisfied that the Lord had heard his prayer, he gave the damsel some ornaments worn in eastern countries; asking at the same time respecting her kindred. On learning that she was of his master's relations, he bowed down his head and worshipped, blessing God. His words were addressed to the Lord, but being spoken in the hearing of Rebekah, she could perceive who he was, and whence he came.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made the camels kneel, - for repose. "The time when the maidens that draw water come out." The evening was the cool part of the day. The simple maidens of primitive days attended personally to domestic affairs. The experienced steward might therefore naturally expect to see the high-born damsels of the land at the public well, which had probably given rise to the neighboring town. The prayer of the aged servant is conceived in a spirit of earnest, childlike faith. The matter in hand is of extraordinary importance. A wife is to be found for the heir of promise. This was a special concern of God, and so the single-hearted follower of Abraham makes it. He takes upon himself the choice of a maiden among those that come to draw, to whom he will make the request of a particular act of kindness to a stranger, and he prays God that the intended bride may be known by a ready compliance with his request. The three qualifications, then, in the mind of the venerable domestic for a bride for his master's son, are a pleasing exterior, a kindly disposition, and the approval of God.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. And he said, O Lord God of my master&#8212;The servant appears worthy of the master he served. He resolves to follow the leading of Providence; and while he shows good sense in the tokens he fixes upon of ascertaining the temper and character of the future bride, he never doubts but that in such a case God will direct him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That this was not a rash and vain fancy, but a special expectation and confidence wrought in him by God’s Spirit, appears both by the eminent prudence and godliness of this person, and by the exact correspondency of the event with his prayer, and by parallel examples, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/6-36.htm" title="And Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,">Judges 6:36</a> <a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm" title="Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:">1 Samuel 6:7</a> 14:8</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She that thou hast appointed; </span> Heb. <span class="ital">evidently pointed out; </span> or, <span class="ital">exactly searched out, </span> as a person meet for him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,  <p>let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink,....

The sign for which he makes petition is the voluntary offer on the part of a girl to give water, not only to himself, but also to his camels. This would be no mere formality, but a practical and laborious act of kindness towards a stranger, done probably in the presence of many bystanders and idlers; and therefore making a demand upon energy and moral courage as well as physical strength.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before taking the oath, the servant asks whether, in case no woman of their kindred would follow him to Canaan, Isaac was to be conducted to the land of his fathers. But Abraham rejected the proposal, because Jehovah took him from his father's house, and had promised him the land of Canaan for a possession. He also discharged the servant, if that should be the case, from the oath which he had taken, in the assurance that the Lord through His angel would bring a wife to his son from thence. </body></html>
