He was made to forget his misery. 2. He was made fruitful in the land of his affliction. The seven plenteous years came, and were ended. We ought to look forward to the end of the days, both of our prosperity and of our opportunity. We must not be secure in prosperity, nor slothful in making good use of opportunity. Years of plenty will end; what thy hand finds to do, do it; and gather in gathering time. The dearth came, and the famine was not only in Egypt, but in other lands. Joseph was diligent in laying up, while the plenty lasted. He was prudent and careful in giving out, when the famine came. Joseph was engaged in useful and important labours. Yet it was in the midst of this his activity that his father Jacob said, Joseph is not! What a large portion of our troubles would be done away if we knew the whole truth! Let these events lead us to Jesus. There is a famine of the bread of life throughout the whole earth. Go to Jesus, and what he bids you, do. Attend to His voice, apply to him; he will open his treasures, and satisfy with goodness the hungry soul of every age and nation, without money and without price. But those who slight this provision must starve, and his enemies will be destroyed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two sons were born to Joseph during the seven years of plenty. "Menasseh." God made him forget his toil and his father's house. Neither absolutely. He remembered his toils in the very utterance of this sentence. And he tenderly and intensely remembered his father's house. But he is grateful to God, who builds him a home, with all its soothing joys, even in the land of his exile. His heart again responds to long untasted joys. "Fruitful in the land of my affliction." It is still, we perceive, the land of his affliction. But why does no message go from Joseph to his mourning father? For many reasons. First, he does not know the state of things at home. Secondly, he may not wish to open up the dark and bloody treachery of his brothers to his aged parent. But, thirdly, he bears in mind those early dreams of his childhood. All his subsequent experience has confirmed him in the belief that they will one day be fulfilled. But that fulfillment implies the submission not only of his brothers, but of his father. This is too delicate a matter for him to interfere in. He will leave it entirely to the all-wise providence of his God to bring about that strange issue. Joseph, therefore, is true to his life-long character. He leaves all in the hand of God, and awaits in anxious, but silent hope, the days when he will see his father and his brethren.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>50-52. unto Joseph were born two sons&#8212;These domestic events, which increased his temporal happiness, develop the piety of his character in the names conferred upon his children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1711</span> In the land which hitherto hath been to me a land of affliction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the name of the second called he Ephraim,....
