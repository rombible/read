There is no authority for the supposition that the name means “revealer of secrets.”<p><span class= "bld">Asenath.</span>—Án Egyptian word signifying the “favourite of Neith,” the Egyptian Minerva.<p><span class= "bld">Potipherah.</span>—See Note on <a href="/genesis/39-1.htm" title="And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.">Genesis 39:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">On.</span>—This is also an Egyptian word, signifying the sun, whence in Hebrew the name of this city was Bethshemesh, <span class= "ital">house of the sun; </span>in Greek, Heliopolis; and in Latin, Oppidum Solls. It was famous for its temple of Ra, the sun, destroyed at an early period by the Persians, but still remarkable for its ruins, among which is an obelisk covered with hieroglyphics of extreme antiquity. Several of the obelisks now at Rome were brought by the emperor Caligula from this spot. It is situated about six miles north-east of Cairo.<p>A difficulty has been felt by some in a Hebrew shepherd being thus described as marrying the daughter of a priest of the sun; and also that Joseph, a worshipper of the One God, should ally himself with an idolater. But the elevation of a slave to high rank is not an uncommon occurrence in the East, especially as he might be of as good birth and education as his owner, slaves being obtained either by kidnapping, or by war. And a slave so raised to power, would not be likely to oppose his benefactor, nor would even a high priest refuse a daughter to the king’s favourite, especially if, as appears to have been the case, he had first been raised to the priesthood. Joseph too, would rightly regard the whole matter as providential, and though he might not know for what exact purpose, as regards his race, he was thus exalted, there was noble work for him to do in saving Egypt from perishing by famine. The narrative throughout represents him as remaining true to the religion of his family (<a href="/context/genesis/41-51.htm" title="And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.">Genesis 41:51-52</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-18.htm" title="And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:">Genesis 42:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-29.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me?

We must remember, however, that their worship had not degenerated as yet into the miserable idolatry of later times, and that the Egyptian creed contained much primæval truth, though in a corrupted form. Pharaoh himself, in <a href="/context/genesis/41-38.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?">Genesis 41:38-39</a>, speaks as one that acknowledged a supreme God, and Joseph throughout freely used to him the name of Elohim. As for Asenath, no doubt Joseph would teach her higher views of the Deity, and make her acquainted with the religious hopes and destinies of the Abrahamic race.<p>The possibility, however, of a foreigner attaining to high rank in Egypt, is demonstrated by the story of Saneha, translated in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. vi., pp. 131-150. It belongs to the reign of Amenemha I., a king of the twelfth dynasty, and represents Saneha as entering Egypt in the dress of a herbseller, but in time he marries there the eldest daughter of a local king, has a large landed estate given him, “which abounded in wines more than in water,” and, finally, is sent for by King Amenemha, and raised to such high rank, as to be clad in “garments of kingly attire,” and on his going to the royal palace “the king’s children attend him, proceeding even unto the great gates.” This curious evidence, which is even a little older than the time of Joseph, proves that there is nothing unusual or improbable in his exaltation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:33-45 Joseph gave good advice to Pharaoh. Fair warning should always be followed by good counsel. God has in his word told us of a day of trial before us, when we shall need all the grace we can have. Now, therefore, provide accordingly. Pharaoh gave Joseph an honourable testimony. He is a man in whom the spirit of God is; and such men ought to be valued. Pharaoh puts upon Joseph marks of honour. He gave him such a name as spoke the value he had for him, Zaphnath-paaneah, a revealer of secrets. This preferment of Joseph encourages all to trust in God. Some translate Joseph's new name, the saviour of the world. The brightest glories, even of the upper world, are put upon Christ, the highest trust lodged in his hand, and all power given him, both in heaven and earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pharaoh approves of his counsel, and selects him as "the discreet and wise man" for carrying it into effect. "In whom is the Spirit of God." He acknowledges the gift that is in Joseph to be from God. "All my people behave" - dispose or order their conduct, a special meaning of this word, which usually signifies to kiss. "His ring." His signet-ring gave Joseph the delegated power of the sovereign, and constituted him his prime minister or grand vizier. "Vestures of fine linen." Egypt was celebrated for its flax, and for the fineness of its textures. The priests were arrayed in official robes of linen, and no man was allowed to enter a temple in a woolen garment (Herodotus ii. 37, 81). "A gold chain about his neck." This was a badge of office worn in Egypt by the judge and the prime minister. It had a similar use in Persia and Babylonia <a href="/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>. "The second chariot." Egypt was noted for chariots, both for peaceful and for warlike purposes (Herodotus ii. 108). The second in the public procession was assigned to Joseph. "Bow the knee." The various explications of this proclamation agree in denoting a form of obeisance, with which Joseph was to be honored. I am Pharaoh, the king <a href="/genesis/12-15.htm">Genesis 12:15</a>. "Without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot." Thou art next to me, and without thee no man shall act or move. "Zaphenath-paneah." Pharaoh designates him the preserver of life, as the interpreter of the dream and the proposer of the plan by which the country was saved from famine. He thus naturalizes him so far as to render his civil status compatible with his official rank. "Asenath." The priests were the highest and most privileged class in Egypt. Intermarriage with this caste at once determined the social position of the wonderous foreigner. His father-in-law was priest of On, a city dedicated to the worship of the sun.<p>With our Western and modern habit we may at the first glance be surprised to find a stranger of a despised race suddenly elevated to the second place in the kingdom. But in ancient and Eastern governments, which were of a despotic character, such changes, depending on the will of the sovereign, were by no means unusual. Secondly, the conviction that "the Spirit of God was in" the mysterious stranger, was sufficient to overbear all opposing feelings or customs. And, lastly, it was assumed and acted on, as a self-evident fact, that the illustrious stranger could have no possible objection to be incorporated into the most ancient of nations, and allied with its noblest families. We may imagine that Joseph would find an insuperable difficulty in becoming a citizen of Egypt or a son-in-law of the priest of the sun. But we should not forget that the world was yet too young to have arrived at the rigid and sharplydefined systems of polytheism or allotheism to which we are accustomed. Some gray streaks of a pure monotheism, of the knowledge of the one true God, still gleamed across the sky of human memory. Some faint traces of one common brotherhood among mankind still lingered in the recollections of the past. The Pharaoh of Abraham's day feels the power of him whose name is Yahweh <a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>. Abimelek acknowledges the God of Abraham and Isaac <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22-23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-28.htm">Genesis 26:28-29</a>. And while Joseph is frank and faithful in acknowledging the true God before the king of Egypt, Pharaoh himself is not slow to recognize the man in whom the Spirit of God is. Having experienced the omniscience and omnipotence of Joseph's God, he was prepared, no doubt, not only himself to offer him such adoration as he was accustomed to pay to his national gods, but also to allow Joseph full liberty to worship the God of his fathers, and to bring up his family in that faith.<p>Joseph was now in his thirtieth year, and had consequently been thirteen years in Egypt, most part of which interval he had probably spent in prison. This was the age for manly service <a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>. He immediately enters upon his office.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45.

In looking at this profusion of honors heaped suddenly upon Joseph, it cannot be doubted that he would humbly yet thankfully acknowledge the hand of a special Providence in conducting him through all his checkered course to almost royal power; and we, who know more than Joseph did, cannot only see that his advancement was subservient to the most important purposes relative to the Church of God, but learn the great lesson that a Providence directs the minutest events of human life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Zaphnath-paaneah, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">The revealer of secrets, </span> as the Hebrews generally understand it, and with them most others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Poti-pherah, </span> not that <span class="ital">Potiphar, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/39-1.htm" title="And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.">Genesis 39:1</a></span>; both because he had another title, and dwelt in another place; and because it is not probable Joseph would have married the daughter of so unchaste a mother; but another and a greater person.

Which, according to the paraphrase of Onkelos, signifies one to whom hidden things are revealed; or, as Jonathan, a revealer of secrets; and so most of the Jewish writers explain it; and which seems to be given him from his interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, and revealing what was hereafter to come to pass. The word is only used in this place, at least the latter part of it and Aben Ezra confesses his ignorance of it, whether it is an Egyptian word or not; Kircher (a) most asserts it, and says it signifies a prophet (or foreteller) of future things. Though some think the first part of the name has some respect to the Egyptian idol Baal Zephon, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2</a>, and that, in this new name Pharaoh gave Joseph upon his promotion, he inserted the name of his god, as Nebuchadnezzar, when he gave new names to Daniel and his comparisons, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>, <p>and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah; not the same with Potiphar, Joseph's master, as Jarchi says, not only their, names differ, but also their offices; nor would Joseph, it is imagined, marry the daughter of such a woman, so wicked as his mistress was, and had so much abused him, and been the cause of all his troubles; nor was this Asenath the daughter of Dinah by Shechem, as some Jewish writers (b) assert, whom Potiphar's wife, having no child, brought up as her own, which is not at all probable; but an Egyptian woman, the daughter of the person before named: who was <p>priest of On: the same with Aven; See Gill on <a href="/ezekiel/30-17.htm">Ezekiel 30:17</a>; and which in Ptolemy (c) is called Onii, about twenty two miles from Memphis, and said to be the metropolis of the "Heliopolitan home"; and has been since called "Heliopolis", as it is here in the Septuagint version, which signifies the city of the sun, and is the same with Bethshemesh, the house of the sun, <a href="/jeremiah/43-13.htm">Jeremiah 43:13</a>; where, as Herodotus (d) says, the sun was worshipped, and sacrifice offered to it, and the inhabitants of this place are by him said to be the wisest and most rational of the Egyptians (e); here Potipherah, Joseph's father-in-law, was "priest"; and Strabo (f) says, at Heliopolis we saw large houses, in which the priests dwelt; for here especially of old it was said, that this was the habitation of priests, of philosophers, and such as were given to astronomy: the Septuagint version and Josephus (g) call this man Petephre; and an Heathen writer (h), Pentephre, a priest of Heliopolis; which a very learned man (i) says, in the Egyptian tongue, signifies a priest of the sun; and so Philo says (k), that Joseph married the daughter of a famous man in Egypt, who had the priesthood of the sun. But the word may as well be rendered "prince" (l), as it is when there is nothing to determine its sense otherwise, as there is none here; and it is more likely, that Pharaoh should marry his prime minister into the family of one of his princes than of his priests; this seems to be more agreeable to the high rank that Joseph was raised to, as well as more suitable to his character as a worshipper of the true God, who would not choose to marry the daughter of an idolatrous priest: though, according to Diodorus Siculus (m), the Egyptian priests were second to the king in honour and authority, and were always about him, and were of his council; and Aelianus, says (n), that formerly with the Egyptians the judges were priests, and the eldest of them was a prince, and had the power of judging all; and even Sethon, king of Egypt, was a priest of Vulcan: whether this prince or priest was of the king's family, or whether the kings of Egypt had a power to dispose of the daughters of their subjects, especially of their priests or princes when dead, is not certain: perhaps no more, as Bishop Patrick observes, is meant, than that Pharaoh made this match, and which was a mark of great honour and affection to Joseph; and which, if even disagreeable to him, being an idolater, he could not well refuse: <p>and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt; either the name and fame of him, as Aben Ezra interprets it, see <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>; or rather he himself went forth in all his grandeur before related, and took a tour, throughout the whole land to observe the fruitfulness of it, and make choice of proper places to lay up his intended stores. <p>(a) Prodrom.

Joseph) - <span class="cmt_word">the daughter of Potipherah</span> - Potipherah ("devoted to the sun") - Potiphar (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>). The name is very common on Egyptian monuments (Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 32) - <span class="cmt_word">priest</span> - or prince (Onkelos.), as in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, where the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, as explained by <a href="/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>, means a principal minister of State, though the probability is that Poti-pherah belonged to the priestly caste in Egypt - <span class="cmt_word">of On</span> - or Heliopolis,  <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), the name on the monuments being ta-Ra or pa-Ra, house of the sun. "The site of Heliopolis is still marked by the massive walls that surround it, and by a granite obelisk bearing the name of Osirtasen I., of the twelfth dynasty, dating about 3900 years ago" (Wilkinson in Rawlinson's 'Herod.,' 2. p. 8). The priests attached to the temple of the sun at Heliopolis enjoyed the reputation of being the most intelligent and cultured historians in Egypt (Herod., 2:3). That a priest's daughter should have married with a foreign shepherd may, have been distasteful to the prejudices of an intolerant priesthood (Bohlen), but in the case of Asenath and Joseph it was recommended by sundry powerful considerations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, Joseph was a descendant of Abraham, whom a former Pharaoh had recognized and honored as a prince, and ' The Story of Saneha,' a hieratic papyrus belonging to the twelfth dynasty, shows that Eastern foreigners might even become sons-in-law to the most powerful potentates under the ancient empire (vide 'Records of the Past,' vol. 6. pp. 135-150). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, Joseph was at this time grand vizier of the realm, with absolute control of the lives and fortunes of its people (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 44). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, he was obviously a favorite of Pharaoh, who, besides being monarch of the realm, was the recognized head of the priestly caste, over whom, therefore, he exercised more than a merely external authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Though a foreign shepherd Joseph had become a naturalized Egyptian, as may be gathered from <a href="/genesis/43-32.htm">Genesis 43:32</a>. And, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, he was circumcised, which, if this rite was already observed in Egypt, and did not originate with Joseph, would certainly not prove a bar to the contemplated alliance (<span class="accented">vide</span> Canon Cook in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 480; Kurst, 'Hist. of Old Covenant,' &sect; 88; Hengstenberg, 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' pp. 32-35). As to the probability of Joseph consenting to become son-in-law to a heathen priest, it may suffice to remember that though marriage with idolaters was expressly forbidden by patriarchal commandment (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1</a>), and afterwards by Mosaic statute (<a href="/genesis/34-16.htm">Genesis 34:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), it was sometimes contracted for what seemed a perfectly adequate reason, viz., the furtherance of the Divine purposes concerning Israel, and apparently too with the Divine sanction (cf. the cases of Moses, <a href="/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>, and Esther, Esther 2:16); that Joseph may have deemed the religion of Egypt, especially in its early symbolical forms, as perfectly compatible with a pure monotheistic worship, or, if he judged it idolatrous, he may both have secured for himself complete toleration and have felt himself strong enough to resist its seductions; that Asenath may have adopted her husband's faith, though on this, of course, nothing can be affirmed; and lastly, that the narrator of this history pronounces no judgment on the moral quality of Joseph's conduct in consenting to this alliance, which, though overruled for good, may have been, considered in itself, a sin. <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt</span> in the discharge of his vice-regal duties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 41:46-57 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joseph's Promotion. - This counsel pleased Pharaoh and all his servants, so that he said to them, "Shall we find a man like this one, in whom the Spirit of God is?" "The Spirit of Elohim," i.e., the spirit of supernatural insight and wisdom.
