He pined no longer for the open downs of Canaan as he had done in the prison; but his love for his father was as warm as ever.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:46-57 In the names of his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, Joseph owned the Divine providence. 1. He was made to forget his misery. 2. He was made fruitful in the land of his affliction. The seven plenteous years came, and were ended. We ought to look forward to the end of the days, both of our prosperity and of our opportunity. We must not be secure in prosperity, nor slothful in making good use of opportunity. Years of plenty will end; what thy hand finds to do, do it; and gather in gathering time. The dearth came, and the famine was not only in Egypt, but in other lands. Joseph was diligent in laying up, while the plenty lasted. He was prudent and careful in giving out, when the famine came. Joseph was engaged in useful and important labours. Yet it was in the midst of this his activity that his father Jacob said, Joseph is not! What a large portion of our troubles would be done away if we knew the whole truth! Let these events lead us to Jesus. There is a famine of the bread of life throughout the whole earth. Go to Jesus, and what he bids you, do. Attend to His voice, apply to him; he will open his treasures, and satisfy with goodness the hungry soul of every age and nation, without money and without price. But those who slight this provision must starve, and his enemies will be destroyed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two sons were born to Joseph during the seven years of plenty. "Menasseh." God made him forget his toil and his father's house. Neither absolutely. He remembered his toils in the very utterance of this sentence. And he tenderly and intensely remembered his father's house. But he is grateful to God, who builds him a home, with all its soothing joys, even in the land of his exile. His heart again responds to long untasted joys. "Fruitful in the land of my affliction." It is still, we perceive, the land of his affliction. But why does no message go from Joseph to his mourning father? For many reasons. First, he does not know the state of things at home. Secondly, he may not wish to open up the dark and bloody treachery of his brothers to his aged parent. But, thirdly, he bears in mind those early dreams of his childhood. All his subsequent experience has confirmed him in the belief that they will one day be fulfilled. But that fulfillment implies the submission not only of his brothers, but of his father. This is too delicate a matter for him to interfere in. He will leave it entirely to the all-wise providence of his God to bring about that strange issue. Joseph, therefore, is true to his life-long character. He leaves all in the hand of God, and awaits in anxious, but silent hope, the days when he will see his father and his brethren.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>50-52. unto Joseph were born two sons&#8212;These domestic events, which increased his temporal happiness, develop the piety of his character in the names conferred upon his children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Hath expelled all sorrowful remembrance of it by my present comfort and glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All my toil, and all my father’s house, </span> i.e. the toil of my father’s house, or the toil and misery which for many years I have endured by means of my father’s family, and my own brethren, who sold me hither; a figure called <span class="ital">hendyadis.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh,....

The name makes us ask the question why Joseph, when supreme in Egypt, sent no message to his father, who was living in a region distant only a few days’ journey.

The name Zaphnath-Paaneah (a form adapted to the Hebrew, for &#x3a8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7; lxx; according to a Greek scholium, &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, "salvator mundi" (Jerome), answers to the Coptic P-sote-m-ph-eneh, - P the article, sote salvation, m the sign of the genitive, ph the article, and eneh the world (lit., aetas, seculum); or perhaps more correctly, according to Rosellini and more recent Egyptologists, to the Coptic P-sont-em-ph-anh, i.e., sustentator vitae, support or sustainer of life, with reference to the call entrusted to him by God.<p>(Note: Luther in his version, "privy councillor," follows the rabbinical explanation, which was already to be found in Josephus (Ant. ii. 6, 1): &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, from &#1510;&#1508;&#1504;&#1514;  equals  &#1510;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; occulta, and &#1508;&#1506;&#1504;&#1495; revelator.)<p>Asenath, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8; (lxx), possibly connected with the name Neith, the Egyptian Pallas. Poti-Phera, &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834; (lxx), a Coptic name signifying ille qui solis est, consecrated to the sun (&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7; with the aspirated article signifies the sun in Memphitic). On was the popular name for Heliopolis (&#x397;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, lxx), and according to Cyrill. Alex. and <a href="/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a> signifies the sun; whilst the name upon the monuments is ta-R or pa-R, house of the sun (Brugsch, Reisebericht, p. 50). From a very early date there was a celebrated temple of the sun here, with a learned priesthood, which held the first place among the priests' colleges of Egypt (Herod. 2, 3; Hengst. pp. 32ff.). This promotion of Joseph, from the position of a Hebrew slave pining in prison to the highest post of honour in the Egyptian kingdom, is perfectly conceivable, on the one hand, from the great importance attached in ancient times to the interpretation of dreams and to all occult science, especially among the Egyptians, and on the other hand, from the despotic form of government in the East; but the miraculous power of God is to be seen in the fact, that God endowed Joseph with the gift of infallible interpretation, and so ordered the circumstances that this gift opened the way for him to occupy that position in which he became the preserver, not of Egypt alone, but of his own family also. And the same hand of God, by which he had been so highly exalted after deep degradation, preserved him in his lofty post of honour from sinking into the heathenism of Egypt; although, by his alliance with the daughter of a priest of the sun, the most distinguished caste in the land, he had fully entered into the national associations and customs of the land. </body></html>
