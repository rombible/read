The token of the covenant was circumcision. It is here said to be the covenant which Abraham and his seed must keep. Those who will have the Lord to be to them a God, must resolve to be to him a people. Not only Abraham and Isaac, and his posterity by Isaac, were to be circumcised, but also Ishmael and the bond-servants. It sealed not only the covenant of the land of Canaan to Isaac's posterity, but of heaven, through Christ, to the whole church of God. The outward sign is for the visible church; the inward seal of the Spirit is peculiar to those whom God knows to be believers, and he alone can know them. The religious observance of this institution was required, under a very severe penalty. It is dangerous to make light of Divine institutions, and to live in the neglect of them. The covenant in question was one that involved great blessings for the world in all future ages. Even the blessedness of Abraham himself, and all the rewards conferred upon him, were for Christ's sake. Abraham was justified, as we have seen, not by his own righteousness, but by faith in the promised Messiah.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thirdly, the temporal and the spiritual are brought together. The land of promise is made sure to the heir of promise, "for a perpetual possession," and God engages to "be their God." The phrase "perpetual possession" has here two elements of meaning - first, that the possession, in its coming form of a certain land, shall last as long as the co-existing relations of things are continued; and, secondly, that the said possession in all the variety of its ever grander phases will last absolutely forever. Each form will be perfectly adequate to each stage of a progressive humanity. But in all its forms and at every stage it will be their chief glory that God is their God.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The stranger (<span class="ital">gêr</span>) has no fixed possession in a land. The land where he has been a stranger is now promised to become his settled possession. The promise, therefore, reverses Abraham’s present position. The land will be no longer one of “sojourning” (<span class="ital">megûrîm</span>), but a “possession” (<span class="ital">aḥuzzah</span>).

Jehovah now appeared to Him again, when he was ninety-nine years old, twenty-four years after his migration, and thirteen after the birth of Ishmael, to give effect to the covenant and prepare for its execution. Having come down to Abram in a visible form (<a href="/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>), He said to him, "I am El Shaddai (almighty God): walk before Me and be blameless." At the establishment of the covenant, God had manifested Himself to him as Jehovah (<a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>); here Jehovah describes Himself as El Shaddai, God the Mighty One. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;: from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; to be strong, with the substantive termination ai, like &#1495;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497; the festal, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; the old man, &#1505;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; the thorn-grown, etc. This name is not to be regarded as identical with Elohim, that is to say, with God as Creator and Preserver of the world, although in simple narrative Elohim is used for El Shaddai, which is only employed in the more elevated and solemn style of writing. It belonged to the sphere of salvation, forming one element in the manifestation of Jehovah, and describing Jehovah, the covenant God, as possessing the power to realize His promises, even when the order of nature presented no prospect of their fulfilment, and the powers of nature were insufficient to secure it. The name which Jehovah thus gave to Himself was to be a pledge, that in spite of "his own body now dead," and "the deadness of Sarah's womb" (<a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>), God could and would give him the promised innumerable posterity. On the other hand, God required this of Abram, "Walk before Me (cf. <a href="/genesis/5-22.htm">Genesis 5:22</a>) and be blameless" (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>). "Just as righteousness received in faith was necessary for the establishment of the covenant, so a blameless walk before God was required for the maintenance and confirmation of the covenant." This introduction is followed by a more definite account of the new revelation; first of the promise involved in the new name of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2-8</a>), and then of the obligation imposed upon Abram (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>). "I will give My covenant," says the Almighty, "between Me and thee, and multiply thee exceedingly." &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; signifies, not to make a covenant, but to give, to put, i.e., to realize, to set in operation the things promised in the covenant - equivalent to setting up the covenant (cf. <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a> and <a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12</a> with <a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>). This promise Abram appropriated to himself by falling upon his face in worship, upon which God still further expounded the nature of the covenant about to be executed. </body></html>
