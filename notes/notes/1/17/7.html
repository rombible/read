The token of the covenant was circumcision. It is here said to be the covenant which Abraham and his seed must keep. Those who will have the Lord to be to them a God, must resolve to be to him a people. Not only Abraham and Isaac, and his posterity by Isaac, were to be circumcised, but also Ishmael and the bond-servants. It sealed not only the covenant of the land of Canaan to Isaac's posterity, but of heaven, through Christ, to the whole church of God. The outward sign is for the visible church; the inward seal of the Spirit is peculiar to those whom God knows to be believers, and he alone can know them. The religious observance of this institution was required, under a very severe penalty. It is dangerous to make light of Divine institutions, and to live in the neglect of them. The covenant in question was one that involved great blessings for the world in all future ages. Even the blessedness of Abraham himself, and all the rewards conferred upon him, were for Christ's sake. Abraham was justified, as we have seen, not by his own righteousness, but by faith in the promised Messiah.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Next, the spiritual part of the covenant comes into view. "To be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee." Here we find God, in the progress of human development, for the third time laying the foundations of a covenant of grace with man. He dealt with Adam and with Noah, and now be deals with Abraham. "A perpetual covenant." This covenant will not fail, since God has originated it, notwithstanding the moral instability of man. Though we cannot as yet see the possibility of fulfilling the condition on man's side, yet we may be assured that what God purposes will somehow be accomplished. The seed of Abraham will eventually embrace the whole human family in fellowship with God.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. but thy name shall be Abraham&#8212;In Eastern countries a change of name is an advertisement of some new circumstance in the history, rank, or religion of the individual who bears it. The change is made variously, by the old name being entirely dropped for the new, or by conjoining the new with the old; or sometimes only a few letters are inserted, so that the altered form may express the difference in the owner's state or prospects. It is surprising how soon a new name is known and its import spread through the country. In dealing with Abraham and Sarai, God was pleased to adapt His procedure to the ideas and customs of the country and age. Instead of Abram, "a high father," he was to be called Abraham, "father of a multitude of nations" (see Re 2:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Whatsoever I am or have, all that shall be thine, and shall be employed for thy protection, consolation, and salvation.

Jehovah now appeared to Him again, when he was ninety-nine years old, twenty-four years after his migration, and thirteen after the birth of Ishmael, to give effect to the covenant and prepare for its execution. Having come down to Abram in a visible form (<a href="/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>), He said to him, "I am El Shaddai (almighty God): walk before Me and be blameless." At the establishment of the covenant, God had manifested Himself to him as Jehovah (<a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>); here Jehovah describes Himself as El Shaddai, God the Mighty One. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;: from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; to be strong, with the substantive termination ai, like &#1495;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497; the festal, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; the old man, &#1505;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; the thorn-grown, etc. This name is not to be regarded as identical with Elohim, that is to say, with God as Creator and Preserver of the world, although in simple narrative Elohim is used for El Shaddai, which is only employed in the more elevated and solemn style of writing. It belonged to the sphere of salvation, forming one element in the manifestation of Jehovah, and describing Jehovah, the covenant God, as possessing the power to realize His promises, even when the order of nature presented no prospect of their fulfilment, and the powers of nature were insufficient to secure it. The name which Jehovah thus gave to Himself was to be a pledge, that in spite of "his own body now dead," and "the deadness of Sarah's womb" (<a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>), God could and would give him the promised innumerable posterity. On the other hand, God required this of Abram, "Walk before Me (cf. <a href="/genesis/5-22.htm">Genesis 5:22</a>) and be blameless" (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>). "Just as righteousness received in faith was necessary for the establishment of the covenant, so a blameless walk before God was required for the maintenance and confirmation of the covenant." This introduction is followed by a more definite account of the new revelation; first of the promise involved in the new name of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2-8</a>), and then of the obligation imposed upon Abram (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>). "I will give My covenant," says the Almighty, "between Me and thee, and multiply thee exceedingly." &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; signifies, not to make a covenant, but to give, to put, i.e., to realize, to set in operation the things promised in the covenant - equivalent to setting up the covenant (cf. <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a> and <a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12</a> with <a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>). This promise Abram appropriated to himself by falling upon his face in worship, upon which God still further expounded the nature of the covenant about to be executed. </body></html>
