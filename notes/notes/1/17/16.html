This must be remembered in estimating the conduct of Abram and Sarah in the matter of Hagar. They had long waited, and hoped, before taking measures of their own for the fulfilment of the promise. The rest of the verse should be translated, “she shall become (grow into) nations: kings of peoples shall become of her, that is, “shall spring from her.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:15-22 Here is the promise made to Abraham of a son by Sarai, in whom the promise made to him should be fulfilled. The assurance of this promise was the change of Sarai's name into Sarah. Sarai signifies my princess, as if her honour were confined to one family only; Sarah signifies a princess. The more favours God confers upon us, the more low we should be in our own eyes. Abraham showed great joy; he laughed, it was a laughter of delight, not of distrust. Now it was that Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day; now he saw it and was glad, Joh 8:56. Abraham, dreading lest Ishmael should be abandoned and forsaken of God, put up a petition on his behalf. God gives us leave in prayer to be particular in making known our requests. Whatever is our care and fear, should be spread before God in prayer. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and the great thing we should desire is, that they may be kept in covenant with Him, and may have grace to walk before him in uprightness. Common blessings are secured to Ishmael. Outward good things are often given to those children of godly parents who are born after the flesh, for their parents' sake. Covenant blessings are reserved for Isaac, and appropriated to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the journey, Rachel dies at the birth of her second son. "A stretch." It was probably a few furlongs. "Fear not." The cause for encouragement was that the child was born, and that it was a son. Rachel's desire and hope expressed at the birth of Joseph were therefore, fulfilled <a href="/genesis/30-24.htm">Genesis 30:24</a>. "When her soul was departing." This phrase expresses not annihilation, but merely change of place. It presupposes the perpetual existence of the soul. "Ben-oni," son of my pain, is the natural expression of the departing Rachel. "Benjamin." The right hand is the seat of power. The son of the right hand is therefore, the child of power. He gave power to his father, as he was his twelfth son, and so completed the number of the holy family. "Ephrath and Beth-lehem" are names the origin of which is not recorded. "The pillar of Rachel's grave." Jacob loves the monumental stone. "Unto this day." This might have been written ten or twenty years after the event, and therefore, before Jacob left Kenaan (see on <a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). The grave of Rachel was well known in the time of Samuel <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, and the Kubbet Rahil, dome or tomb of Rachel, stands perhaps on the identical spot, about an English mile north of Bethlehem.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16.

As the sign of the covenant, circumcision is called in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>, "the covenant in the flesh," so far as the nature of the covenant was manifested in the flesh. It was to be extended not only to the seed, the lineal descendants of Abraham, but to all the males in his house, even to every foreign slave not belonging to the seed of Abram, whether born in the house or acquired (i.e., bought) with money, and to the "son of eight days," i.e., the male child eight days old; with the threat that the uncircumcised should be exterminated from his people, because by neglecting circumcision he had broken the covenant with God. The form of speech &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;, by which many of the laws are enforced (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-20.htm">Leviticus 7:20-21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-25.htm">Leviticus 7:25</a>, etc.), denotes not rejection from the nation, or banishment, but death, whether by a direct judgment from God, an untimely death at the hand of God, or by the punishment of death inflicted by the congregation or the magistrates, and that whether &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is added, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>, etc., or not. This is very evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-9.htm">Leviticus 17:9-10</a>, where the extermination to be effected by the authorities is distinguished from that to be executed by God Himself (see my biblische Archologie ii. 153, 1). In this sense we sometimes find, in the place of the earlier expression "from his people," i.e., his nation, such expressions as "from among his people" (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-4.htm">Leviticus 17:4</a>, <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>), "from Israel" (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>), "from the congregation of Israel" (<a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>); and instead of "that soul," in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-4.htm">Leviticus 17:4</a>, <a href="/leviticus/17-9.htm">Leviticus 17:9</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-33.htm">Exodus 30:33</a>, <a href="/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38</a>), we find "that man." </body></html>
