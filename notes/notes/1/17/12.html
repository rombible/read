The token of the covenant was circumcision. It is here said to be the covenant which Abraham and his seed must keep. Those who will have the Lord to be to them a God, must resolve to be to him a people. Not only Abraham and Isaac, and his posterity by Isaac, were to be circumcised, but also Ishmael and the bond-servants. It sealed not only the covenant of the land of Canaan to Isaac's posterity, but of heaven, through Christ, to the whole church of God. The outward sign is for the visible church; the inward seal of the Spirit is peculiar to those whom God knows to be believers, and he alone can know them. The religious observance of this institution was required, under a very severe penalty. It is dangerous to make light of Divine institutions, and to live in the neglect of them. The covenant in question was one that involved great blessings for the world in all future ages. Even the blessedness of Abraham himself, and all the rewards conferred upon him, were for Christ's sake. Abraham was justified, as we have seen, not by his own righteousness, but by faith in the promised Messiah.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The time of circumcision is the eighth day. Seven is the number of perfection. Seven days are therefore regarded as a type of perfectage and individuality. At this stage, accordingly, the sign of sanctification is made on the child, betokening the consecration of the heart to God, when its rational powers have come into noticeable activity. To be "cut off from his people" is to be excluded from any part in the covenant, and treated simply as a Gentile or alien, some of whom seem to have dwelt among the Israelites. It was sometimes accompanied with the sentence of death <a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>; and this shows that it did not of itself imply such a doom. Excommunication, however, for the omission of circumcision, would be extremely rare, as no parent would intentionally neglect the sacred interest of his child. Yet the omission of this rite has not been unprecedented, as the children of Israel did not generally circumcise their children in the wilderness <a href="/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Every man child among you shall be circumcised&#8212;This was the sign in the Old Testament Church as baptism is in the New, and hence the covenant is called "covenant of circumcision" (Ac 7:8; Ro 4:11). The terms of the covenant were these: on the one hand Abraham and his seed were to observe the right of circumcision; and on the other, God promised, in the event of such observance, to give them Canaan for a perpetual possession, to be a God to him and his posterity, and that in him and his seed all nations should be blessed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Eight days; </span> not before that time, because of the child’s weakness and imperfection, and impurity too, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/22-30.htm" title="Likewise shall you do with your oxen, and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day you shall give it me.">Exodus 22:30</a> <a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm" title="And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.">Leviticus 12:3</a></span>, for which reason also beasts were not to be offered to God before the eighth day, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/22-30.htm" title="Likewise shall you do with your oxen, and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day you shall give it me.">Exodus 22:30</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every man-child in your generations, </span> successively, until the Messias come, who shall circumcise your hearts, and change this ordinance for another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Bought with money of any stranger:</span> these were of two sorts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

A son or infant of eight days old; it might not be circumcised before, but for some reasons might be deferred longer. The reasons why this rite was ordered to be performed in infancy, according to Maimonides (d), were, because if it had been deferred to riper age it might have been neglected, and never performed; and because at such an age the pain is not so sensibly felt, by reason of the tenderness of the skin, and the weakness of the imagination; as also because the affections of parents are not then so strong as they are when one year, and especially three or four years old; and particularly it was ordered on the eighth day, because all animals, as soon as born, on account of their great humidity, are very weak, and scarce any other than they were in their mother's womb, until the end of seven days, after which they begin to be reckoned among those that perceive the air of this world; and so he remarks the same is to be observed in beasts, that seven days they were to be with their dam, <a href="/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>. According to the Jewish canon (e),"an infant might be circumcised on the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, neither less nor more; (not less than eight days, nor more than twelve (f);) according to the usual custom on the eighth; if he was born between the two evenings, he is circumcised on the ninth; if between the two evenings of the evening of the sabbath, he is circumcised on the tenth; if on a festival day, after the sabbath, he is circumcised on the eleventh; if on the two days of the beginning of the year, he is circumcised on the twelfth: an infant that is sick, they do not circumcise it until it is well.''Which sickness they interpret not of sore eyes, and the like, but of an ague or fever; and when a child on the eighth day is red or yellow, or a woman has lost her children through circumcision, two or three one after another, then it is deferred; and they reckon seven days from a child's recovery from sickness, and then circumcise it (g); but circumcision on the eighth day was always reckoned most valid and authentic, and according to rule; see Gill on <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>; and the Jews were careful to do it on the eighth day as soon as they could, though only when and while it was day. Their canon or rule runs thus (h),"they do not circumcise until the sun shines out on the eighth day of a child's birth, and all the day is fit for circumcision; but they that are prepared hasten to the commandment, and circumcise immediately in the morning; and indeed circumcision, which is not in its proper time, is never performed but in the day:''for they observe (i), it is said on the eighth day, <a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>; the day, and not the night. And this was to be done to <p>every man child in your generations; in all succeeding ages until the Messiah came, the end of the law; and when the lease of the land of Canaan, of which this was a seal, would be out; and when the righteousness of faith, it was also a seal of, would come upon the uncircumcised Gentiles: <p>he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger,  <p>which is not of thy seed; concerning which Maimonides (k) gives these rules,"a servant is born in the power of an Israelite, and another that is taken from Heathens, the master is bound to circumcise them; but he that is born in the house is circumcised on the eighth day; and he that is bought with money is circumcised on the day that he is received, even if he received him on the day he is born, he is circumcised on that day; if he receives a grown servant of Heathens, and the servant is not willing to be circumcised, he bears with him a whole year, but more than that it is forbidden to keep him, seeing he is uncircumcised, but he must send him again to the Heathens.''No man was to be forced to embrace the true religion, or obliged against his will to submit to its ordinances. <p>(d) Moreh Nevochim, par. 3. c. 49. p. 506.

The operation at this exceedingly early age (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/17-25.htm" title="And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.">Genesis 17:25</a></span>) is probably for the purpose (1) of including all males, (2) of coinciding with the first period of the mother’s uncleanness, <a href="/context/leviticus/12-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean....">Leviticus 12:2-3</a>, (3) of inflicting the smallest degree of suffering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every male</span>] The important principle is here laid down that the rite is to be required of every male member of the household. All slaves are to be circumcised, both those “born in the house” (cf. <a href="/genesis/14-14.htm" title="And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.">Genesis 14:14</a>), and those “bought with money” (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-44.htm" title="But every man's servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.">Exodus 12:44</a>). It was thus that the first principles of charity were interwoven with the foundation of the Chosen People.
