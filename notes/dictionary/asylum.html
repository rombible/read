            <P><B>ASYLUM</B><P> a-si'-lum:
<P> The custom of fleeing to specially sacred places to obtain the protection of a deity is found all over the world (Post, Grundriss, II, 252). In ancient Israel we meet with it in two forms--the asylum of the altar and the asylum of the cities of refuge. The altar at the House of God was a place to which persons in danger fled for protection (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+1:50" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Kings 1:50</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+2:28">2:28</A>). It had horns and must not be confused with the altars of earth or stone that were used for lay sacrifices. See <a href="altar.html">ALTAR</a>; <a href="sanctuary.html" target="_blank">SANCTUARY</a>.
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:14">Exodus 21:14</A> provides that a murderer is to be taken from the altar to be put to death. The law of the cities of refuge proceeds upon a somewhat different principle. Its objects are
<P> (1) to shield a homicide from the avenger of blood until trial, and
<P> (2) to provide a refuge for the manslayer who has not been guilty of murder. There is one reference to the institution in the history of the kingdom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+14:14" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Samuel 14:14</A>). For the legal and geographical information, see <a href="cities-of-refuge.html">CITIES OF REFUGE</a>; <a href="homicide.html" target="_blank">HOMICIDE</a>.
