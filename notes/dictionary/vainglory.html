            <P><B>VAINGLORY</B><P> van-glo'-ri (kenodoxia):
<P> "Vainglory" is the translation of kenodoxia, "empty glory" or "pride," nearly akin to vanity in the modern sense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</A>). Kenodoxos is "vainglorious" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:26">Galatians 5:26</A>, "Let us not be desirous of vainglory," the Revised Version (British and American) "Let us not become vainglorious"). In 1<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:16">John 2:16</A> the Revised Version (British and American) has "the vainglory of life" (alazoneia tou biou) for "the pride of life"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+4:16">James 4:16</A>, "Ye glory in your vauntings" (alazoneia). Kenodoxia is translated "vainglory" (The Wisdom of Solomon 14:14, "For by the vain glory of men they (idols) entered into the world," the Revised Version (British and American) "vaingloriousless"); alazoneia occurs in The Wisdom of Solomon 5:8, translated "vaunting." "Pride is applicable to every object, good or bad, high or low, small or great; vanity is applicable only to small objects; pride is therefore good or bad; vanity is always bad; it is always emptiness or nothingness" (Crabb, English Synonymes).
