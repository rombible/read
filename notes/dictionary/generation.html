            <P><B>GENERATION</B><P> jen-er-a'-shun (Latin generatio, from genero, "beget"):
<P> (1) The translation
<P> (a) of dor, "circle," "generation," hence, "age," "period," "cycle":
<P> "many generations" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:7">Deuteronomy 32:7</A>);
<P> (b) the people of any particular period or those born about the same time:
<P> "Righteous before me in this generation" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+7:1">Genesis 7:1</A>); "four generations" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+42:16">Job 42:16</A>);
<P> (c) the people of a particular class or sort, with some implied reference to hereditary quality; the wicked (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:5">Deuteronomy 32:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:11">Proverbs 30:11</A>); the righteous (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+14:5">Psalms 14:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+112:2">112:2</A>).
<P> (2) toledhoth, "births," hence
<P> (a) an account of a man and his descendants:
<P> "The book of the generations of Adam" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+5:1">Genesis 5:1</A>);
<P> (b) successive families:
<P> "The families of the sons of Noah, after their generations" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:32">Genesis 10:32</A>);
<P> (c) genealogical divisions:
<P> "The children of Reuben .... their generations, by their families" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+1:20">Numbers 1:20</A>); (d) figurative, of the origin and early history of created things: "The generations of the heavens and of the earth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:4">Genesis 2:4</A>).
<P> (3) genea, "a begetting," "birth," "nativity," therefore
<P> (a) the successive members of a genealogy:
<P> "All the generations from Abraham unto David" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+1:17">Matthew 1:17</A>);
<P> (b) a race, or class, distinguished by common characteristics, always (in the New Testament) bad:
<P> "Faithless and perverse generation" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:17">Matthew 17:17</A>);
<P> (c) the people of a period:
<P> "This generation shall not pass away" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+21:32">Luke 21:32</A>);
<P> (d) an age (the average lifetime, 33 years):
<P> "Hid for (Greek "from the") ages and (from the) generations" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</A>). The term is also by a figurative transference of thought applied to duration in eternity: "Unto all generations for ever and ever" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+3:21">Ephesians 3:21</A>) (Greek "all the generations of the age of the ages").
<P> (4) genesis, "source," "origin":
<P> "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</A>; the American Revised Version, margin "The genealogy of Jesus Christ").
<P> (5) gennema, "offspring," "progeny"; figurative:
<P> "O generation of vipers" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</A> the King James Version).
<P> (6) genos, "stock," "race," in this case spiritual:
<P> "But ye are a chosen generation" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:9">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</A>; the American Standard Revised Version "an elect race").
