<P> (1) Here Israel was defeated by the Philistines, 4,000 men falling in the battle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+4:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 4:1</A>). It appears also to have been the scene of the disaster when the ark of God was captured (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+4:3">1&nbsp;Samuel 4:3</A>). The place is not identified. It was over against Aphek; but this site is also unknown (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:18">Joshua 12:18</A>). Eusebius, Onomasticon places it between Jerusalem and Ascalon, in the neighborhood of Beth-shemesh. Conder suggests Deir Aban, fully 2 miles East of `Ain Shems (PEF, III, 24).
<P> (2) A stone set up by Samuel to perpetuate the memory of the signal victory granted to Israel over the Philistines in answer to his prayer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+7:12">1&nbsp;Samuel 7:12</A>). It stood between Mizpeh and Shen. The latter is probably identical with `Ain Sinia, North of Bethel. This defines the district in which it may be found; but no identification is yet possible.
