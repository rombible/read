            <P><B>BAALSAMUS</B><P> ba-al'-sa-mus Baalsamos; (the King James Version Balasamus):
<P> B. stood at the right side of Ezra, when the law was read to the people (1 Esdras 9:43). Compare Maaseiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:7" target="_blank">Nehemiah 8:7</A>). the Valley of Rephaim where David obtained a signal victory over the Philistines; it was higher than Jerusalem for David asked, "Shall I go up against the Philis?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+5:20">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+14:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 14:11</A>). The exact site is unknown, but if the Vale of Rephaim is el Beka`a, the open valley between Jerusalem and Mar Elias, then Baal-perazim would probably be the mountains to the East near what is called the "Mount of Evil Counsel" (see <a href="rainfall-in-jerusalem-in-inches.html">JERUSALEM</a>). The Mount Perazim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:21">Isaiah 28:21</A> would appear to be the same spot.
