            <P><B>SABIE</B><P> sa'-bi-e (Sabeie, or Sabie; the King James Version Sabi):
<P> In 1 Esdras 5:34 both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American), following Codex Alexandrinus, read "the sons of Phacareth, the sons of Sabie" (the King James Version "Sabi") for the "Pochereth-hazzebaim" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:57">Ezra 2:57</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:59">Nehemiah 7:59</A>. Codex Vaticanus reads correctly as one proper name: "Phacareth Sabie."
<P> SABTA or SABTAH
<P> sab'-ta (cabhta', cabhtah):
<P> Third son of Cush (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:7">Genesis 10:7</A> = <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:9</A>). A place Sabta is probably to be looked for in South Arabia. Arab geographers give no exact equivalent of the name. Al Bekri (i.65) quotes a line of early poetry in which Dhu 'l Sabta is mentioned, and the context might indicate a situation in Yemamah; but the word is possibly not a proper name. It is usually identified with Saubatha (Ptol., vi.7, 38) or with the Sabota of Pliny (vi.32; xii.32), an old mercantile city in South Arabia celebrated for its trade in frankincense and, according to Ptolemy, possessing 60 temples. It is said also to have been the territory of a king Elisarus, whose name presents a striking resemblance to Dhu 'l-Adhar, one of the "Tubbas" or Himyarite kings of Yemen. Another conjecture is the Saphtha of Ptolemy (vi.7, 30) near the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf.
