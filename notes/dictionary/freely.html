            <P><B>FREELY</B><P> fre'-li (chinnam, nedhabhah; dorean parrhesiazomai):
<P> "Freely" occurs in three senses:ts two slightly different words. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+7:22">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:22</A> the word is apeleutheros, "a freeman," one who was born a slave and has received freedom. In this case it refers to spiritual freedom. He that was in bondage to sin has been presented with spiritual freedom by the Lord. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+6:15">Revelation 6:15</A> the word is simply eleutheros, "a free man" as opposed to a slave.
<P> (1) Gratis, for nothing (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:5">Numbers 11:5</A>, chinnam, "for nought," "the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely," the Revised Version (British and American) "for nought"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+10:8">Matthew 10:8</A>, dorean, "Freely ye have received, freely give," the Revised Version (British and American) omits "have";
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</A>, "being justified freely by his grace"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+11:7">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:7</A>, "I have preached to you the gospel freely," the Revised Version (British and American) "for nought"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+22:17">22:17</A>, "Take the water of life freely"; charizomai (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</A>) is translated "freely give," ta charisthenta (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+2:12">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:12</A>), "the things that are freely given," the American Standard Revised Version has "were" for "are."
<P> (2) Willingly, spontaneously:
<P> nedhabhah, "willing offering" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+54:6">Psalms 54:6</A>, "I will freely sacrifice unto thee," the Revised Version (British and American) "with a freewill-offering";
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+14:4">Hosea 14:4</A>, "I will love them freely"); nadhabh, "to give willingly'' (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:68">Ezra 2:68</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "willingly offered"; compare 1:6); nedabh Aramaic (7:15; compare 7:13,16).
<P> (3) Without hindrance or restraint, 'akhal, "to eat" is rendered in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:16">Genesis 2:16</A>, "Thou mayest freely eat," the King James Version margin" Hebrew, eating thou shalt eat"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:30">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:30</A>, "if .... the people had eaten freely"; parrhesiazomai, "to speak freely, openly, boldly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+26:26">Acts 26:26</A>, "Unto whom also I speak freely"); meta parrhesias, "with full speech" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:29">Acts 2:29</A>, "I may say unto you freely").
<P> Revised Version has "have drunk freely" for "well drunk" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:10">John 2:10</A>). The word is methusko, Pass. "to become drunk." Comparison with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:45">Luke 12:45</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:18">Ephesians 5:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+5:7">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+17:2">Revelation 17:2</A>, where the same word is translated the King James Version "made drunk," the Revised Version (British and American) "made drunken" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:49">Matthew 24:49</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+11:21">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</A>, "drunken"), will show that the meaning is "drunk," which was the rendering of Tyndale and Cranmer; Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) has cum inebriati fuerint; Plummer renders "have become drunk, are drunk."
