<P> One of the strong cities besieged and captured by Judas Maccabeus in his campaign East of the Jordan (1 Macc 5:26,43 f). In the temple of Atargatis, which was situated here, those who fled from the city were put to death. It is apparently identical with Ashteroth Karnaim. It is called Camion in 2 Macc 12:21.
