            <P><B>OIL, ANOINTING</B><P> (shemen hamishchah):
<P> This holy oil, the composition of which is described in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+30:22-33">Exodus 30:22-33</A>, was designed for use in the anointing of the tabernacle, its furniture and vessels, the altar and laver, and the priest, that being thus consecrated, they might be "most holy." It was to be "a holy anointing oil" unto Yahweh throughout all generations (30:31). On its uses, compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+37:29">Exodus 37:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+8:12">Leviticus 8:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+10:7">10:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:10">21:10</A>. The care of this holy oil was subsequently entrusted to Eleazar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:16">Numbers 4:16</A>); in later times it seems to have been prepared by the sons of the priests (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:30">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:30</A>). There is a figurative allusion to the oil on Aaron's head in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+133:2">Psalms 133:2</A>.
