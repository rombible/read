            <P><B>ANER (1)</B><P> a'-ner (`aner; Septuagint Aunan; Samaritan Pentateuch, `anram, "sprout," "waterfall"):
<P> One of the three "confederates" of Abraham in his pursuit after the four kings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:13,14">Genesis 14:13,14</A>). Judging from the meanings of the two other names, Mamre being the name of the sacred grove or tree (Jahwist) and synonymous with Hebron (Priestly Code); and Eschol--a name of a valley (lit. "grape cluster") from which the personal names are derived--it may be expected to explain the name Aner in a similar way. Dillmann suggested the name of a range of mountains in that vicinity (Comm. at the place and Rosen in ZDMG, XII, 479; Skinner, Genesis, 365).
<P> S. Cohon
