<P> The translation of 'ashishah, in the King James Version in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:19">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+16:3">1&nbsp;Chronicles 16:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+2:5">Song of Solomon 2:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+3:1">Hosea 3:1</A>. In all, these passages the Revised Version (British and American) reads "cake of raisins" or "raisins." It was probably a pressed raisin cake. the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) read "flagons," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+22:24">Isaiah 22:24</A> as a rendering of nebhalim, which is elsewhere (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:24">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+10:3">10:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+16:1">2&nbsp;Samuel 16:1</A>, etc.) rendered "bottles," the Revised Version, margin "skins." These were the bags or bottles made of the whole skin of a kid, goat or other animal. the Revised Version (British and American) has "flagons" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+25:29">Exodus 25:29</A> and 37:16 as translation of qeshawoth, a golden jug or jar used in the tabernacle from which the drink offerings were poured out. The same word is translated "cups" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:7">Numbers 4:7</A>.
