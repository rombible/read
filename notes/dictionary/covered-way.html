<P> Mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+16:18">2&nbsp;Kings 16:18</A> (the King James Version "covert") as a gallery belonging to the temple, concerning the purpose of which opinions differ. Some consider it to have been the place where the king stood or sat during the Sabbath services; others, a public place for teaching; others, the way by which the priest entered the sanctuary on the Sabbath.
