<P> Only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+28:27">Deuteronomy 28:27</A>, where it probably refers to the parasitic skin disease of that name which is very common in Palestine. It is due to a small mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, which makes burrows in the skin and sometimes causes extensive crusts or scabs, attended with a severe itching. It is very easily communicated from person to person by contact, and can be cured only by destruction of the parasite. This disease disqualified its victims for the priesthood (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:20">Leviticus 21:20</A>).
