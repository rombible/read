            <P><B>BESOM</B><P> be'-zum:
<P> Occurs only once in Scripture: "I will sweep it with the besom of destruction" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+14:23">Isaiah 14:23</A>). Refers to what was in store for Babylon. The Hebrew word maT'ate', rendered "besom," is close of kin to the one (ti'te'thiha) rendered "sweep." In early English "besom" was synonymous with "broom," and is still so used in some parts of England.
