            <P><B>CHORAZIN</B><P> ko-ra'-zin (Chorazin, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</A>; Chorazin, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</A>; Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek Chorazein):
<P> A city whose name appears only in the woe pronounced against it by Christ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</A>). Its appearance there, however, shows that it must have been a place of some importance, and highly privileged by the ministry of Jesus. It was already deserted in the time of Eusebius, who places it 2 miles from Capernaum (Onomasticon, under the word). We can hardly doubt that it is represented by the extensive ruins of Kerazeh, on the heights to the north of Tell Chum. It is utterly desolate: a few carved stones being seen among the heaps. There are traces of a Roman road which connected the ancient city with the great highway between north and south which touched the lake shore at Khan Minyeh.
