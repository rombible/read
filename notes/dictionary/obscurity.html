            <P><B>OBSCURITY</B><P> ob-sku'-ri-ti:
<P> In modern English generally denotes a state of very faint but still perceptible illumination, and only when preceded by some such adjective as "total" does it imply the absence of all light. In Biblical English, however, only the latter meaning is found. So in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+29:18">Isaiah 29:18</A> ('ophel, "darkness"); 58:10; 59:9 (choshekh, "darkness"); Additions to Esther 11:8 (gnophos, "darkness"). Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+20:20">Proverbs 20:20</A>, the King James Version "in obscure darkness," the English Revised Version "in the blackest darkness," the American Standard Revised Version "in blackness of darkness."
