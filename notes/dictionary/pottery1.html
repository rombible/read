It is abundantly evident, both that the Hebrews used earthenware vessels in the wilderness and that the potters trade was afterward carried on in Palestine. They had themselves been concerned in the potters trade in Egypt, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/81-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/81-6.html">Psalms 81:6</a> ) and the wall-paintings minutely illustrate the Egyptian process. The clay, when dug, was trodden by mens feet so as to form a paste, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/41-25.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/41-25.html">Isaiah 41:25</a> ) Wisd. 15:7; then placed by the potter on the wheel beside which he sat, and shaped by him with his hands.

There was at Jerusalem a royal establishment of potters, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/4-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/4-23.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:23</a> ) from whose employment, and from the fragments cast away in the process, the Potters Field perhaps received its name.
