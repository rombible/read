<P> Mules are mentioned as riding animals for princes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:29">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:9">18:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+1:33,38,44">1&nbsp;Kings 1:33,38,44</A>); in the tribute brought to Solomon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:24">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:24</A>); as beasts of burden (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+5:17">2&nbsp;Kings 5:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:40">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:40</A>); horses and mules are obtained from the "house of Togarmah" in the distant north (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:14">Ezekiel 27:14</A>). The injunction of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+32:9">Psalms 32:9</A>, "Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding," need not be understood as singling out the horse and mule as more in need of guidance than the rest of the brute creation, but rather as offering familiar examples to contrast with man who should use his intelligence.
<P> At the present day mules are used as pack animals and for drawing freight wagons, rarely for riding. One does not often see in Palestine mules as large and fine as are common in Europe and America. This may be because most of the mares and many of the donkeys are small.
