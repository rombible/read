<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:23">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:23</A> the King James Version reads "those that dwell among plants and hedges," the Revised Version (British and American) "the inhabitants of Netaim and Gederah." The latter may be taken as correct. Gederah was in the Judean Shephelah. Here also we should seek for Netaim; but no likely identification has yet been suggested.
