<P> The word is found twice in Paulinic literature.: <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:13">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:13</A>, "not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies," and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+3:11">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:11</A>, "work not at all, but are busybodies." It is also found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+4:15">1&nbsp;Peter 4:15</A> the King James Version (the Revised Version (British and American) "meddler") "or as a busybody in other men's matters." If these passages be coupled with such others as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:2-10">James 3:2-10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+4:11">4:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:29,31">Ephesians 4:29,31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+3:2">Titus 3:2</A>, it becomes evident that sins against the eighth commandment were as common in the apostolic church as they are today. To this day backbiting is a common trait of oriental peoples. And it is this sin which is so repeatedly warned against by the apostles, as in direct conflict with the ethics of Christianity, and in violation of that spirit of brotherly love and mutual trust which Christ has enjoined on His followers, and which is the very marrow of the outward revelation of the Christian faith (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+13">1&nbsp;Corinthians 13</A>).
