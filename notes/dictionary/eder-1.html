            <P><B>EDER (1)</B><P> e'-der ('edher, "flock"):
<P> (1) One of the "uttermost cities" of Judah in the Negeb ("South") near the border of Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:21">Joshua 15:21</A>), possibly Kh. el `Adar, 5 miles South of Gaza, but probably this is too far west.
<P> (2) Eder (the King James Version Edar) or better Migdal Eder, mighdal `edher, "the tower of the flock"; Gader. After Rachel died and was buried "in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem) .... Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+35:19,21">Genesis 35:19,21</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+35:27">Genesis 35:27</A> he is described as proceeding to Hebron. This "tower of the flock," which may have been only a tower and no town, must therefore be looked for between Bethlehem and Hebron. Jerome says that it was one Roman mile from Bethlehem. In the Septuagint, however, 35:16 and 21 are transposed, which suggests that there may have been a tradition that Migdal Eder was between Bethel and Bethlehem. There must have been many such towers for guarding flocks against robbers. Compare "tower of the watchman" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:8">2&nbsp;Kings 18:8</A>, etc.). The phrase "Migdal Eder" occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+4:8">Micah 4:8</A> where Jerusalem is compared to such a tower.
