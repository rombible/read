            <P><B>REGEM-MELECH</B><P> re'-gem-me'-lek, re'-gem-mel'-ek (reghem melekh):
<P> One of a deputation sent to inquire concerning the propriety of continuing the commemoration of the destruction of the temple by holding a fast (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+7:2">Zechariah 7:2</A>). The text of the passage is in disorder. The name may mean "friend of the king"; hence, some have sought to remove the difficulty by interpreting reghem melekh as a title, not a personal name, reading the clause, "They of Beth-el had sent SHAREZER (q.v. (2)), the friend of the king."
