            <P><B>DRACHMA; DRAM</B><P> drak'-ma, (drachme):
<P> The word is used in the Septuagint as the rendering of beqa`, "half-shekel," which must refer to the light standard for the shekel, as its weight was about 62 grains. In the New Testament the word occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+15:8,9">Luke 15:8,9</A>, where it is rendered "a piece of silver" (m "drachma"). It was commonly taken as equivalent to the Roman denarius, though not strictly so.
