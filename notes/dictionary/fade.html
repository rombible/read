<P> "To fade" is in the Old Testament the translation of nabhel, "to droop or wither," figuratively, "to fade," or "pass way" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:45">Psalms 18:45</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+1:30">Isaiah 1:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+24:4">24:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:1,4">28:1,4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+40:7,8">40:7,8</A>); once it is the translation of balal "to well up," "to overflow"; perhaps from nabhal (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+64:6">Isaiah 64:6</A>, "We all do fade as a leaf"); in the New Testament of maraino, "to come to wither or to fade away" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:11">James 1:11</A>, "So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways," the Revised Version (British and American) "in his goings"); compare The Wisdom of Solomon 28, "Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered" (maraino); amardntinos (amaranth), "unfading," occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+5:4">1&nbsp;Peter 5:4</A>, "the crown of glory that fadeth not away," and amarantos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+1:4">1&nbsp;Peter 1:4</A>), "an inheritance .... that fadeth not away"; compare The Wisdom of Solomon 6:12, "Wisdom is glorious (the Revised Version (British and American) "radiant"), and fadeth not away."
<P> For "fade" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:12">Ezekiel 47:12</A>), the Revised Version (British and American) has "wither"; for "fall" "falleth" "falling" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+34:4">Isaiah 34:4</A>), "fade," "fadeth," "fading".
