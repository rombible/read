            <P><B>MITRE</B><P> mi'-ter In the King James Version this word renders two Hebrew words, both of which, however, come from the same stem, namely, tsanaph, "to coil" or "to wrap round." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+28">Exodus 28</A>, a mitre (the Revised Version margin "turban") is enumerated among Aaron's articles of dress, which were to be made by tailors of recognized skill. On the forefront of the mitre was a "plate of pure gold" with the words "Holy to Yahweh" (i.e. consecrated to Yahweh) inscribed upon it. This gold plate was fastened to the mitre by a blue ribbon. The material of the mitre was fine linen or silk. The word for the headtire (the King James Version "bonnet") of the ordinary priest was a different word. Ezekiel uses the word in connection with Zedekiah (21:26); the prophet associated regal and priestly functions with the throne. It is possible, however, that the two sentences--"remove the mitre," and "take off the crown"--refer to the degradation of the priesthood and of the throne which the downfall of Jerusalem will involve. The Septuagint varies between kidaris and mitra, the former word being used in Sirach 45:12.
