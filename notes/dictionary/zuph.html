            <P><B>ZUPH</B><P> zuf (tsuph, "honeycomb"):
<P> (1) According to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:1</A> b; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:35">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:35</A> (Hebrew verse 20) = "Zophai" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:26</A> (11), an ancestor of Elkanah and Samuel. But Budde and Wellhausen take it to be an adjective, and so read tsuphi, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:1</A> b:
<P> "Tohu a Zuphite, an Ephraimite." It should probably be read also in 1:1a: "Now there was a certain man of the Ramathites, a Zuphite of the hill-country of Ephraim," as the Hebrew construction in the first part of the verse is otherwise unnatural. The Septuagint's Codex Alexandrinus has Soup; Lucian has Souph in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:1</A> b; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:26</A> (11); Codex Vaticanus has Souphei; Codex Alexandrinus and Lucian have Souphi; 6:35 (20), Codex Vaticanus and Codex Alexandrinus have Souph; Lucian has Souphi; and the Kethibh has tsiph.
<P> (2) The Septuagint's Codex Vaticanus and Codex Alexandrinus have Seiph; Lucian has Sipha, "the land of Zuph," a district in Benjamin, near its northern border (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+9:5">1&nbsp;Samuel 9:5</A>).
