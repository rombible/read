            <P><B>SKULL</B><P> skul (gulgoleth; kranion):
<P> The Hebrew word, which is well known to Bible readers in its Aramaic-Greek form "Golgotha," expresses the more or less globular shape of the human skull, being derived from a root meaning "to roll." It is often translated in English Versions of the Bible by "head," "poll," etc. In the meaning "skull" it is found twice (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+9:53">Judges 9:53</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+9:35">2&nbsp;Kings 9:35</A>). In the New Testament the word is found only in connection with GOLGOTHA (which see), "the place of a skull" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:33">Matthew 27:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+15:22">Mark 15:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+19:17">John 19:17</A>), or "the skull" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:33">Luke 23:33</A>).
