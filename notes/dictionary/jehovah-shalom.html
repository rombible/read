            <P><B>JEHOVAH-SHALOM</B><P> je-ho'-va sha'-lom (yahweb shalom, "Yahweh is peace"):
<P> This was the name given by Gideon to the altar he built at Ophra, in allusion to the word spoken to him by the Lord, "Peace be unto thee" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+6:24">Judges 6:24</A>). It is equivalent to "Yahweh is well disposed."
