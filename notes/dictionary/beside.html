<P> Near to, or close to (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+23:2">Psalms 23:2</A>). It is often used to refer to the mental state, to the derangement of the mind (existemi, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</A> the King James Version). Or it may refer to the condition of being out of the ordinary course of the life. A life consecrated to God and spent in the interest of humanity is so designated (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+5:13">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:13</A>). It has the sense also of a state of being out of one's usual mind, but not of mental derangement, occasioned by something that causes amazement or ast onishment (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:42">Mark 5:42</A>). Or it may refer to a state in which one is not conscious of present conditions, but is rapt in vision (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</A>).
<P> Besides is used in the sense of in addition to or that which is over and above what has been said or is possessed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+16:26">Luke 16:26</A>; see the American Revised Version, margin "in"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=phm+1:19">Philemon 1:19</A>).
