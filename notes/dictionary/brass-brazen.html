            <P><B>BRASS; BRAZEN</B><P> bras (nechosheth):
<P> The use of the word brass has always been more or less indefinite in its application. At the present time the term brass is applied to an alloy of copper and zinc or of copper, zinc and tin. The word translated "brass" in the King James Version would be more correctly rendered bronze, since the alloy used was copper and tin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:4" target="_blank">Exodus 27:4</A>). In some passages however copper is meant (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+8:9">Deuteronomy 8:9</A>), as bronze is an artificial product. This alloy was known in Egypt in at least 1600 BC. It was probably known in Europe still earlier (2000 BC), which helps to answer the question as to the source of the tin. Bronze was probably of European origin and was carried to Egypt. At a later period the Egyptians made the alloy themselves, bringing their copper from Sinai, Cyprus or northern Syria (see <a href="copper.html">COPPER</a>), and their tin from the Balkan regions or from Spain or the British Isles (see <a href="tin.html" target="_blank">TIN</a>). When the Children of Israel came into the promised land, they found the Canaanites already skilled in the making and use of bronze instruments. This period marked the transition from the bronze age to the iron age in Palestine Museums possessing antiquities from Bible lands have among their collections many and varied bronze objects. Among the most common are nails, lamps, hand mirrors, locks, cutting instruments, etc. Within comparatively recent times brass, meaning an alloy of copper and zinc, has been introduced into Syria. The alloy is made by the native workmen (see <a href="crafts.html" target="_blank">CRAFTS</a>). Sheet brass is now being extensively imported for the making of bowls, vases, etc. Bronze is practically unknown in the modern native articles
<P> Figurative:
<P> "Brass," naturally, is used in Scripture as the symbol of what is firm, strong, lasting; hence, "gates of brass" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+107:16">Psalms 107:16</A>), "hoofs of brass" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+4:13">Micah 4:13</A>), "walls of brass" (Jeremiah is made as a "brazen wall," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+1:18">Jeremiah 1:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+15:20">15:20</A>), "mountains of brass" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+2:35">Daniel 2:35</A>, the Macedonian empire; the arms of ancient times were mostly of bronze). It becomes a symbol, therefore, of hardness, obstinacy, insensibility, in sin, as "brow of brass" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+48:4">Isaiah 48:4</A>); "they are brass and iron" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+6:28">Jeremiah 6:28</A>, of the wicked); "all of them are brass" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+22:18">Ezekiel 22:18</A>, of Israel).
