            <P><B>IRA</B><P> i'-ra (`ira'; Eiras):
<P> (1) A person referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+20:26">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:26</A> as "priest" (so the Revised Version (British and American) correctly; the King James Version "a chief ruler," the American Standard Revised Version "chief minister") unto David. The translation of the Revised Version (British and American) is the only possible one; but, according to the text, Ira was "a Jairite," and thus of the tribe of Manasseh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:41">Numbers 32:41</A>) and not eligible to the priesthood. On the basis of the Peshitta some would correct "Jairite" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+20:26">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:26</A> into "Jattirite," referring to Jattir, a priestly city within the territory of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:14">Joshua 21:14</A>). Others point to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:18">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:18</A> margin, "David's sons were priests," as an indication that in David's time some non-Levites were permitted to serve--in some sense--as priests.
<P> (2) An "Ithrite," or (with a different pointing of the text) a "Jattirite," one of David's "thirty" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:38">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:38</A> parallel <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:40">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:40</A>); possibly identical with (1).
<P> (3) Another of David's "thirty," son of Ikkesh of Tekoa (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:26">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:28">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:28</A>) and a captain of the temple guard (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:9</A>).
