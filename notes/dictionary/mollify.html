            <P><B>MOLLIFY</B><P> mol'-i-fi (from rakhakh, "to be soft"):
<P> "To make soft," used in modern English only figuratively, as "His anger was mollified." English Versions of the Bible, however, uses the word literally in its two occurrences: <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+1:6">Isaiah 1:6</A>, "wounds, and bruises .... neither bound up, neither mollified with oil"; The Wisdom of Solomon 16:12, "mollifying plaister." Neither occurrence of the word is changed by the Revised Version (British and American).
