The Greek amen (Hebrew 'amen) is used very frequently in the Gospels as an emphatic confirmation of Christ's sayings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+5:18,26">Matthew 5:18,26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:2">6:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:28">Mark 3:28</A>, etc.), and in John's Gospel is repeated to give additional emphasis (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:51">John 1:51</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+3:3,5,11">3:3,5,11</A>, The Revised Version (British and American) makes various changes, as "wholly" for "verily" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+19:13">Job 19:13</A>), "surely" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+39:5">Psalms 39:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+73:13">73:13</A>), "indeed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:12">Mark 9:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+2:25">Romans 2:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+3:5">Hebrews 3:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+7:5">7:5</A>), etc., and sometimes puts "verily" where the King James Version has other words, as "also" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:23">Matthew 13:23</A>), "doubtless" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</A>), etc.
<P> Verity is the translation of 'emeth, "truth," "stedfastness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+111:7">Psalms 111:7</A>, "The works of his hands are verity and judgment," the American Standard Revised Version "truth and justice," the English Revised Version "truth and judgment"); and of aletheia, "truth," "reality," "certainty" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+2:7">1&nbsp;Timothy 2:7</A>), "faith and verity," the Revised Version (British and American) "faith and truth."
