            <P><B>ANATHEMA</B><P> a-nath'-e-ma (anathema):
<P> This word occurs only once in the King James Version, namely, in the phrase "Let him be anathema. Maranatha" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:22" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:22</A>); elsewhere the King James Version renders anathema by "accursed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+12:3">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+1:8,9">Galatians 1:8,9</A>), once by "curse" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</A>). Both words--anathema and anathema--were originally dialectical variations and had the same connotation, namely, offering to the gods. The non-Attic form--anathema--was adopted in the Septuagint as a rendering of the Hebrew cherem (see <a href="accursed.html">ACCURSED</a>), and gradually came to have the significance of the Hebrew word--"anything devoted to destruction." Whereas in the Greek Fathers anathema--as cherem in rabbinic Hebrew-- came to denote excommunication from society, in the New Testament the word has its full force. In common speech it evidently became a strong expression of execration, and the term connoted more than physical destruction; it invariably implied moral worthlessness. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</A> Paul does not simply mean that, for the sake of his fellow-countrymen, he is prepared to face death, but to endure the moral degradation of an outcast from the kingdom of Christ. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+12:3">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:3</A> the expression, "Jesus is anathema"--with its suggestion of moral unfitness--reaches the lowest depths of depreciation, as the expression, "Jesus is Lord," reaches the summit of appreciation.
