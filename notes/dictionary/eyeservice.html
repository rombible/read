            <P><B>EYESERVICE</B><P> i'-sur-vis (ophthalmodouleia):
<P> A term coined by Paul to express the conduct of slaves, who work only when they are watched, and whose motive, therefore, is not fidelity to duty, but either to avoid punishment or to gain reward from their masters (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+6:6">Ephesians 6:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:22">Colossians 3:22</A>). "A vice which slavery everywhere creates and exhibits. Hence, the need for drivers and overseers" (Eadie).
