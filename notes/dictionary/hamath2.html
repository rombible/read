The Hamathites were a Hamitic race, and are included among the descendants of Canaan. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/10-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/10-18.html">Genesis 10:18</a> ) Nothing appears of the power of Hamath until the time of David. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-9.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:9</a> ) Hamath seems clearly to have been included in the dominions of Solomon. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1%20Kings+4:21-24" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=1%20Kings+4:21-24&amp;t=niv">1&nbsp;Kings 4:21-24</a> ) The "store-cities" which Solomon "built in Hamath," ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/8-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/8-4.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 8:4</a> ) were perhaps staples for trade. In the Assyrian inscriptions of the time of Ahab (B.C. 900) Hamath appears as a separate power, in alliance with the Syrians of Damascus, the Hittites and the Phoenicians. About three-quarters of a century later Jeroboam the Second "recovered Hamath." ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/14-28.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/14-28.html">2&nbsp;Kings 14:28</a> ) Soon afterwards the Assyrians took it, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/18-34.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/18-34.html">2&nbsp;Kings 18:34</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/19-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/19-13.html">19:13</a> ) etc., and from this time it ceased to be a place of much importance. Antiochus Epiphanes changed its name to Epiphaneia. The natives, however, called it Hamath even in St. Jeromes time, and its present name, <I>Hamah</I> , is but slightly altered from the ancient form. </FONT></body></html>
