            <P><B>ELDER IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</B><P> (presbuteros):
<P> (1) The word is used adjectivally to denote seniority (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+15:25">Luke 15:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:2">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:2</A>).
<P> (2) Referring to the Jewish elders of the synagogue, usually associated with the scribes and Pharisees, and New Testament passages cited in the previous article.
<P> (3) It denotes certain persons appointed to hold office in the Christian church, and to exercise spiritual oversight over the flock entrusted to them. From the references in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:17">20:17</A> it may be inferred that the churches generally had elders appointed over them. That "elders" and "bishops" were in apostolic and sub-apostolic times the same, is now almost universally admitted; in all New Testament references their functions are identical. The most probable explanation of the difference of names is that "elder" refers mainly to the person, and "bishop" to the office; the name "elder" emphasizes what he is, while "bishop," that is "overseer," emphasizes what the elder or presbyter does.
