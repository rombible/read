            <P><B>JANGLING</B><P> jan'-gling (mataiologia, "vain discourse" "babbling"):
<P> This word is not found in the American Standard Revised Version; once only in the King James Version (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:6">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:6</A>). The American Standard Revised Version has "vain talking," instead of "vain jangling," and evidently means proud, self-conceited talking against what God has revealed and against God Himself.
