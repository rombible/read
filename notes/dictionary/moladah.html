            <P><B>MOLADAH</B><P> mol'-a-da, mo-la'-da (moladhah; Molada):
<P> A place in the far south (Negebh) of Judah, toward Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:26" target="_blank">Joshua 15:26</A>), reckoned to Simeon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:2">Joshua 19:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:28">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:28</A>). It was repopulated after the captivity (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:26">Nehemiah 11:26</A>). It is mentioned always in close proximity to Beersheba. Moladah is probably identical with Malatha, a city in Idumea to which Agrippa at one time withdrew himself (Josephus, Ant, XVIII, vi, 2). The site of this latter city has by Robinson and others been considered to be the ruins and wells of Tell el-Milch, some 13 miles to the East of Beersheba and some 7 miles Southwest of Arad. The chief difficulty is the statement of Eusebius and Jerome that Malatha was "by Jattir," i.e. `Attir; if this is correct the Tell el-Milch is impossible, as it is 10 miles from `Attir, and we have no light at all on the site. See <a href="salt-city-of.html">SALT, CITY OF</a>.
