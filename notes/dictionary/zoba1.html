It probably was eastward of Coele-Syria, and extended thence northeast and east toward, if not even to, the Euphrates. We first hear of Zobah in the time of Saul, when we find it mentioned as a separate country, governed apparently by a number of kings who owned no common head or chief. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/14-47.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/14-47.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:47</a> ) Some forty years later than this we find Zobah under a single ruler Hadadezer son of Rehob. He had wars with Toi king of Hamath, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-10.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:10</a> ) and held various petty Syrian princes as vassals under his yoke. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/10-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/10-19.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:19</a> ) David, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-3.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:3</a> ) attacked Hadadezer in the early part of his reign, defeated his army, and took from him a thousand chariots, seven hundred (seven thousand,) ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/18-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/18-4.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:4</a> ) horsemen and 20,000 footmen. Hadadezers allies, the Syrians of Damascus, were defeated in a great battle. The wealth of Zobah is very apparent in the narrative of this campaign. A man of Zobah, Rezon son of Eliadah, made himself master of Damascus where he proved a fierce adversary to Israel all through the reign of Solomon. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1%20Kings+11:23-25" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=1%20Kings+11:23-25&amp;t=niv">1&nbsp;Kings 11:23-25</a> ) Solomon also was, it would seem engaged in a war with Zobah itself.

The name however, is found at a later date in the inscriptions of Assyria, where the kingdom of Zobah seems to intervene between Hamath and Damascus. </FONT></body></html>
