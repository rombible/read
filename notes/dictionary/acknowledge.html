<P> To declare that one recognizes the claims of a person or thing fully established. Both in Old Testament and New Testament expressed by various forms of the word "know" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+3:6">Proverbs 3:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+61:9">Isaiah 61:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</A> the King James Version). The Psalmist (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+32:5">Psalms 32:5</A>) "acknowledged" his sin, when he told God that he knew the guilt of what he had done. The Corinthians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+1:14">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:14</A>) "acknowledged" Paul and his companions when they formally recognized their claims and authority.
