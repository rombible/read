            <P><B>TREATY</B><P> tre'-ti (berith, karath berith, "make a covenant," "league," "treaty"):
<P> Although the Israelites were forbidden to make treaties, or enter into covenant, with the Canaanites because of the risk thereby involved of religious apostasy and moral contamination (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+23:32">Exodus 23:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+34:12">34:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+7:2">Deuteronomy 7:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+2:2">Judges 2:2</A>), they were so situated in the midst of the nations that treaty relations of some sort with their neighbors were from time to time inevitable. After the rise of the monarchy, treaties were common. David and Solomon had friendly relations with Hiram, king of Tyre (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+5:15">1&nbsp;Kings 5:15</A>); Asa, to rid himself of the hostile approaches of Baasha, king of Israel, entered into a league with Ben-hadad of Syria, which the prophet Hanani denounced (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+16:1">2&nbsp;Chronicles 16:1</A>); Ahab entered into a similar compact with Ben-hadad's son and successor, and set him at liberty when he was his prisoner of war (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+20:34">1&nbsp;Kings 20:34</A>); and at a later time Jehoshaphat joined Ahab in an expedition against Ben-hadad II to Ramoth-gilead in which Ahab lost his life (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+22">1&nbsp;Kings 22</A>). Sometimes with Syria and neighboring states against the terrible Assyrian power, and sometimes with Egypt against Assyria or Babylon, the kings of Israel and Judah entered into treaty to resist their advances and to preserve their own independence (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+17:4">2&nbsp;Kings 17:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+7:11">Hosea 7:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+30:1">Isaiah 30:1</A>). Against such alliances the prophets raised their testimony (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+31:1">Isaiah 31:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+27:3">Jeremiah 27:3</A>).
