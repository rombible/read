            <P><B>SHUNAMMITE</B><P> shoo'-na-mit (shunammith, shunammith; Codex Vaticanus Somaneitis; Codex Alexandrinus Soumanites):
<P> Applied to natives of Shunem.
<P> (1) Abishag, who was brought to minister to the aged king David, love for whom led Adonijah to his doom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+1:3,15">1&nbsp;Kings 1:3,15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+2:17">2:17</A>, etc.).
<P> (2) The woman, name unknown, whose son Elisha raised from the dead (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+4:12">2&nbsp;Kings 4:12</A>, etc.). Later when apparently she had become a widow, after seven years' absence on account of famine, in the land of the Philistines, she returned to find her property in the hands of others. Elisha's intervention secured its restoration (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+8:1-6">2&nbsp;Kings 8:1-6</A>).
<P> (3) The Shulammite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+6:13">Song of Solomon 6:13</A>). In this name there is the exchange of "l" for "n" which is common.
<P> W. Ewing
