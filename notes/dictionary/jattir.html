            <P><B>JATTIR</B><P> jat'-er (yattir, and yattir):
<P> A town in the hill country of Judah, mentioned in conjunction with Shamir and Socoh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:48">Joshua 15:48</A>); one of the cities given to the "children of Aaron the priest" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:14">Joshua 21:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:57">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:57</A>). David after his victory over the Amalekites sent a present of the spoil from Ziklag "to them that were in Jattir" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:27">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:27</A>).
<P> It is now Khirbet `Attir, an important ruin, in the extreme South of the hill country, 5 miles Southeast of edh Dhariyeh and 20 miles Southeast of Belt Jibrin. This must Correspond to the "very large village Jethira" which is mentioned in Eusebius, Onomasticon (119 27; 133 3; 134 24, etc.) as 20 miles Southeast of Eleutheropolis (i.e. Beit Jibrin). The site is full of caves. See PEF, III, 408, Sh XXV.
