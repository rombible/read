            <P><B>DESPAIR</B><P> de-spar':
<P> The substantive only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+4:8">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:8</A>, "perplexed, but not in (the Revised Version (British and American) "yet not unto") despair," literally, "being at a loss, but not utterly at a loss." "Unto despair" here conveys the force of the Greek prefix ex ("utterly," "out and out"). Desperate, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+6:26">Job 6:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+17:11">Isaiah 17:11</A>. In the latter instance, the Hebrew adjective is derived from a verb = "to be sick," and the literally, rendering would be "incurable" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+34:6">Job 34:6</A>, "my wound is incurable"). Desperately in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+17:9">Jeremiah 17:9</A> the King James Version, where the heart is said to be "desperately (i.e. incurably) wicked" or "sick."
