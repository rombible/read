            <P><B>CUMBER; CUMBERED</B><P> kum'-ber, (katargeo, "to make idle," perispaomai, "to be drawn about," in mind "to be distracted"):
<P> Spoken of the barren fig tree in the parable: "Cut it down; why doth it also cumber (block up, make unproductive) the ground?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</A>). Cumbered means to be over-occupied with cares or business, distracted: "But Martha was cumbered about much serving" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</A>). The word cumbrance occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:12">Deuteronomy 1:12</A>: "How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance?" (Torach, "an encumbrance," "a burden"). Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+1:14">Isaiah 1:14</A>, where the Revised Version, margin has "cumbrance," the Revised Version (British and American) "trouble."
