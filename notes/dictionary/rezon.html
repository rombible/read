            <P><B>REZON</B><P> re'-zon (rezon; Rhazon):
<P> Son of Eliadah, and a subject of Hadadezer, king of Zobah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+11:23">1&nbsp;Kings 11:23</A>). The name appears to be given as chezyon; Hazein (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+15:18">1&nbsp;Kings 15:18</A>; see HEZION), where he is the father of Tabrimmon, whose son Ben-hadad I is known through his leaaue with Asa, king of Judah. When David conquered Zobah, Rezon renounced his allegiance to Hadadezer and became powerful as an independent chief, capturing Damascus and setting up as king. Along with Hadad, the noted Edomite patriot, he became a thorn in the side of Solomon, the one making himself obnoxious in the South, the other in the North, of the kingdom of Israel, both being animated with a bitter hatred of the common foe. It is said of Rezon that he "reigned over Syria" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+11:25">1&nbsp;Kings 11:25</A>), and if the surmise adopted by many scholars is correct that he is the same as Hezion (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+15:18">1&nbsp;Kings 15:18</A>), then he was really the founder of the dynasty of Syrian kings so well known in the history of this period of Israel; and the line would run: Rezon, Tabrimmon, Ben-hadad I, and Ben-hadad II.
