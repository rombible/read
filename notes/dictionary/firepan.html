            <P><B>FIREPAN</B><P> fir'-pan (machtah, "firepan," "censer," "snuffdish," from chathah, "to snatch up"):
<P> A vessel for carrying coals. Brazen firepans were part of the furnishings of the altar of burnt offerings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:3">Exodus 27:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+38:3">38:3</A>, and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:14">Numbers 4:14</A>, where the King James Version wrongly reads "censers," the context indicating a vessel belonging to the brazen altar).
<P> The same word is translated "snuffdishes" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+25:38">Exodus 25:38</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+37:23">37:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:9">Numbers 4:9</A>, where it refers to golden firepans which belonged to the golden candlestick or lamp stand, and were used to receive the burnt ends of the wicks. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+7:50">1&nbsp;Kings 7:50</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+4:22">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:22</A>, although the King James Version reads "censers," the context points to the firepans belonging to the candlestick; as also in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+25:15">2&nbsp;Kings 25:15</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+52:19">Jeremiah 52:19</A>, translated "firepans" in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American). A similar firepan designated by the same Hebrew word but translated "censer" was used to carry the burning coals upon which the incense was thrown and burned (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+10:1">Leviticus 10:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+16:12">16:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+16:6,17">Numbers 16:6,17</A>).
<P> See CENSER.
<P> The firepan or censer of the Hebrews was doubtless similar to the censer of the Egyptians, pictures of which have been found. It consisted of a pan or pot for the coals, which was held by a straight or slightly curved long handle. The style of censer used in recent centuries, swung by three chains, came into use about the 12th century AD.
