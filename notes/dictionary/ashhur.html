            <P><B>ASHHUR</B><P> ash'-ur (ashchur, the King James Version Ashur):
<P> The "father of Tekoa" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:24">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:5">4:5</A>), probably the founder of the village. The original meaning of the name is the "man of Horus," Ashurites (ha-'ashuri). This name occurs in the list of Ish-bosheth's subjects (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+2:9">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:9</A>).
<P> The Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) versions read ha-geshuri, "the Geshurites," designating the small kingdom to the South or Southeast of Damascus. This reading, though adopted by Ewald, Thenius and Wellhausen, is untenable, for during the reign of Ish-bosheth Geshur was ruled by its own king Talmai, whose daughter was married to David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+3:3">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:37">13:37</A>). Furthermore Geshur was too far away from the rest of Ishbosheth's territory. A more consistent reading is ha- 'asheri, as given in the Targum of Jonathan and accepted by Kohler, Klost, Kirkpatrick and Budde, "those of the house of Asher" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:32">Judges 1:32</A>). The term would, then, denote the country to the West of Jordan above Jezreel.
