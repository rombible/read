            <P><B>BATH-RABBIM, THE GATE OF</B><P> bath-rab'-im, (sha`ar bath-rabbim; Septuagint en pulais thugatros pollon, literally "in the gates of the daughter of the many.") The gate of Heshbon near which were the pools compared to the Shulammite's eyes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+7:4">Song of Solomon 7:4</A>). Guthe would translate "by the gate of the populous city." Cheyne would amend the passage and read
 - "Thine eyes are like Solomon's pools, By the wood of Beth-cerem,"
 + and transfer the scene to the pools of Solomon, S. of Bethlehem (EB, under the word). But this is surely very violent. One of the pools of Heshbon still survives, measuring 191 ft. X 139 ft., and is 10 ft. deep. The walls however have been rent by earthquakes, and now no longer retain the water.
