            <P><B>DAMARIS</B><P> dam'-a-ris (Damaris, possibly a corruption of damalis, "a heifer"):
<P> The name of a female Christian of Athens, converted by Paul's preaching (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:34">Acts 17:34</A>). The fact that she is mentioned in this passage together with Dionysius the Areopagite has led some, most probably in error, to regard her as his wife. The singling out of her name with that of Dionysius may indicate some personal or social distinction. Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:12">Acts 17:12</A>.
