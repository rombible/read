            <P><B>BAALZEBUB</B><P> ba-al-ze'-bub ba`al zebhubh = "Lord of flies"; Baal-muian:
<P> A deity worshipped by the Philistines at Ekron (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+1:2,3,6,16" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Kings 1:2,3,6,16</A>). All that can be gathered from this one reference to him in ancient literature is that he had some fame as a god that gave oracles. Ahaziah, son of Ahab, and king of Israel, went to consult him whether he should recover of his sickness, and was therefore rebuked by Elijah, who declared that his death would be the result of this insult to Yahweh. Why he was called "lord of flies," or whether his real name has not be en corrupted and lost are matters of conjecture. See <a href="baal-1.html">BAAL (1)</a>.
