            <P><B>DOUBLE</B><P> dub'-'-l (shanah, "to repeat," as in counting; kaphal, "to fold over," or "double," as a cloth):
<P> A word used quite frequently in the Old Testament. Jacob ordered his sons to take double money in their hands, i.e. twice the necessary amount (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+43:12,15">Genesis 43:12,15</A>). If a thief be caught with a living animal he was to restore double (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:4">Exodus 22:4</A>); if property be stolen out of the house of one to whom it is entrusted he was to restore double (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:7,9">Exodus 22:7,9</A>). The firstborn was to receive a double portion of the inheritance (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+21:17">Deuteronomy 21:17</A>). Likewise also by a beautiful symbol Elisha asked for a double portion of Elijah's spirit to fall upon him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+2:9">2&nbsp;Kings 2:9</A>). Degrees of punishment or sufferings were also expressed by the idea of a doubling (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+61:7">Isaiah 61:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+16:18">Jeremiah 16:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+17:18">17:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+9:12">Zechariah 9:12</A>).
<P> The use of the second Hebrew form in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+11:6">Job 11:6</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:13">Job 41:13</A> seems quite confusing in its translation. the King James Version translates it simply "double," but the Revised Version (British and American) gives it its expanded and derived meaning, "manifold in understanding," and "who shall come within his jaws," respectively, "manifold" in the first instance meaning multiplied, and "jaws" doubtless meaning the double row of teeth. The classic phrases in the New Testament are those used by James to represent instability and a wavering disposition, dipsuchos, literally, "doubleminded" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:8">James 1:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+4:8">4:8</A>).
