            <P><B>ABI (1)</B><P> a'-bi ('abhi):
<P> The name of the mother of King Hezekiah, as given in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:2">2&nbsp;Kings 18:2</A>. Most naturally explained as a contraction of Abijah ("Yahweh is a father," or "is my father"), found in the parallel passage in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:1">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:1</A>. The spelling in the oldest translations seems to indicate that 'abhi is not a copyist's error, but a genuine contracted form. She is spoken of as the daughter of Zechariah, and was of course the wife of Ahaz.
