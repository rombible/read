            <P><B>RUE</B><P> roo (peganon):
<P> One of the plants mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+11:42">Luke 11:42</A> as subject to tithe: in the parallel passage, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</A>, anise and cummin are mentioned. Ruta graveolens (Natural Order, Rutaceae) is the official rue, and a very similar species, R. chalepensis, is indigenous. Rue is a small shrub growing 2 to 4 ft. high with a heavy odor, disagreeable to Westerners, but a favorite with Orientals. A sprig of rue is often fixed on a child's cap or clothes as a kind of charm.
