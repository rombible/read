In the other places, with the exception perhaps of ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/song-of-solomon/1-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/song-of-solomon/1-13.html">Solomon 1:13</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/song-of-solomon/6-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/song-of-solomon/6-2.html">6:2</a> ) the words refer more generally to sweet aromatic odors, the principal of which was that of the balsam or balm of Gilead; the tree which yields this substance is now generally admitted to be the <I>Balsam-odendron opobalsamum</I> . The balm of Gilead tree grows in some parts of Arabia and Africa, and is seldom more than fifteen feet high, with straggling branches and scanty foliage. The balsam is chiefly obtained from incisions in the bark, but is procured also from the green and ripe berries. <LI><I>Necoth</I> .
