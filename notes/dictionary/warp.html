<P> The long threads fixed into the loom to form the basis of the web, and into which the woof is wrought from the shuttle. The warp and the woof lying at right angles to one another have in their Hebrew form (shethi we`erebh) given to modern Jewish speech a secret expression to designate the cross.
<P> See WEAVING.
