            <P><B>MYNDUS</B><P> min'-dus (Mundos):
<P> A city of Asia Minor, situated at the extreme western end of a peninsula jutting into the sea (see CARIA). It seems that the city was independent at an early date and that many Jews lived there, for according to 1 Macc 15:23, it was one of the several places to which the Roman senate, in the year 139 BC, sent a letter in their behalf. The place was important only because of the silver mines in its vicinity. The mines were worked from a very early period, even to the Middle Ages, and have therefore given to the place the modern Turkish name, Gumushlu, meaning a silver mine.
