            <P><B>TEMPLE, A2</B><P> II. EZEKIEL'S PROPHETIC SKETCH
<P> I. Introductory.
<P> 1. Relation to History of Temple:
<P> Wellhausen has said that Ezekiel 40-48 "are the most important in his book, and have been, not incorrectly, called the key to the Old Testament" (Prolegomena, English translation, 167). He means that Ezekiel's legislation represents the first draft, or sketch, of a priestly code, and that subsequently, on its basis, men of the priestly school formulated the Priestly Code as we have it. Without accepting this view, dealt with elsewhere, it is to be admitted that Ezekiel's sketch of a restored temple in chapters 40-43 has important bearings on the history of the Temple, alike in the fact that it presupposes and sheds back light upon the structure and arrangements of the first Temple (Solomon's), and that in important respects it forecasts the plans of the second (Zerubbabel's) and of Herod's temples.
<P> 2. The Conception Unique and Ideal:
<P> While, however, there is this historical relation, it is to be observed that Ezekiel's temple-sketch is unique, presenting features not found in any of the actually built temples. The temple is, in truth, an ideal construction never intended to be literally realized by returned exiles, or any other body of people. Visionary in origin, the ideas embodied, and not the actual construction, are the main things to the prophet's mind. It gives Ezekiel's conception of what a perfectly restored temple and the service of Yahweh would be under conditions which could scarcely be thought of as ever likely literally to arise. A literal construction, one may say, was impossible. The site of the temple is not the old Zion, but "a very high mountain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:2">Ezekiel 40:2</A>), occupying indeed the place of Zion, but entirely altered in elevation, configuration and general character. The temple is part of a scheme of transformed land, partitioned in parallel tracts among the restored 12 tribes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:13-48:7,23-29">Ezekiel 47:13-48:7,23-29</A>), with a large area in the center, likewise stretching across the whole country, hallowed to Yahweh and His service (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+48:8-22">Ezekiel 48:8-22</A>). Supernatural features, as that of the flowing stream from the temple in Ezekiel 47, abound. It is unreasonable to suppose that the prophet looked for such changes--some of them quite obviously symbolical--as actually impending.
<P> 3. Its Symmetrical Measurements:
<P> The visionary character of the temple has the effect of securing that its measurements are perfectly symmetrical. The cubit used is defined as "a cubit and a handbreadth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:5">Ezekiel 40:5</A>), the contrast being with one or more smaller cubits (see CUBIT). In the diversity of opinion as to the precise length of the cubit, it may be assumed here that it was the same sacred cubit employed in the tabernacle and first Temple, and may be treated, as before, as approximately equivalent to 18 inches.
<P> II. Plan of the Temple.
<P> Despite obscurities and corruption in the text of Ezekiel, the main outlines of the ideal temple can be made out without much difficulty (for details the commentaries must be consulted; A. B. Davidson's "Ezekiel" in the Cambridge Bible series may be recommended; compare also Keil; a very lucid description is given in Skinner's "Book of Ezk," in the Expositor's Bible, 406-13; for a different view, see Caldecott, The Second Temple in Jerusalem).
<P> 1. The Outer Court:
<P> The temple was enclosed in two courts--an outer and an inner--quite different, however, in character and arrangement from those of the first Temple. The outer court, as shown by the separate measurements (compare Keil on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:27">Ezekiel 40:27</A>), was a large square of 500 cubits (750 ft.), bounded by a wall 6 cubits (9 ft.) thick and 6 cubits high (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:5">Ezekiel 40:5</A>). The wall was pierced in the middle of its north, east and south sides by massive gateways, extending into the court to a distance of 50 cubits (75 ft.), with a width of 25 cubits (37 1/2 ft.). On either side of the passage in these gateways were three guardrooms, each 6 cubits square (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:7">Ezekiel 40:7</A> margin), and each gateway terminated in "porch," 8 cubits (12 ft.) long (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:9">Ezekiel 40:9</A>), and apparently (thus, the Septuagint, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:14">Ezekiel 40:14</A>; the Hebrew text seems corrupt), 20 cubits across. The ascent to the gateways was by seven steps (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:6">Ezekiel 40:6</A>; compare 40:22,26), showing that the level of the court was to this extent higher than the ground outside. Round the court, on the three sides named--its edge in line with the ends of the gateways--was a "pavement," on which were built, against the wall, chambers, 30 in number (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:17,18">Ezekiel 40:17,18</A>). At the four corners were enclosures (40 cubits by 30) where the sacrifices were cooked (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+46:21-24">Ezekiel 46:21-24</A>)--a fact which suggests that the cells were mainly for purposes of feasting. (The "arches" ('elammim) of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:16,21">Ezekiel 40:16,21</A>, etc. (the Revised Version margin "colonnade"), if distinguished from the "porch" ('ulam)--A. B. Davidson and others identify them--are still parts of the gateway--<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:21">Ezekiel 40:21</A>, etc.).
<P> 2. The Inner Court:
<P> The inner court was a square of 100 cubits (150 ft.), situated exactly in the center of the larger court (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:47">Ezekiel 40:47</A>). It, too, was surrounded by a wall, and had gateways, with guardrooms, etc., similar to those of the outer court, saving that the gateways projected outward (50 cubits), not inward. The gates of outer and inner courts were opposite to each other on the North, East, and South, a hundred cubits apart (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:19,23,27">Ezekiel 40:19,23,27</A>; the whole space, therefore, from wall to wall was 50 and 100 and 50 = 200 cubits). The ascent to the gates in this case was by eight steps (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:37">Ezekiel 40:37</A>), indicating another rise in level for the inner court. There were two chambers at the sides of the north and south gates respectively, one for Levites, the other for priests (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:44-46">Ezekiel 40:44-46</A>; compare the margin); at the gates also (perhaps only at the north gate) were stone tables for slaughtering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:39-43">Ezekiel 40:39-43</A>). In the center of this inner court was the great altar of burnt offering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+43:14-17">Ezekiel 43:14-17</A>)--a structure 18 cubits (27 ft.) square at the base, and rising in four stages (1, 2, 4, and 4 cubits high respectively, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+43:14,15">Ezekiel 43:14,15</A>), till it formed a square of 12 cubits (18 ft.) at the top or hearth, with four horns at the corners (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+43:15,16">Ezekiel 43:15,16</A>). Steps led up to it on the East (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+43:17">Ezekiel 43:17</A>).
<P> See ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING.
<P> 3. The Temple Building and Adjuncts:
<P> The inner court was extended westward by a second square of 100 cubits, within which, on a platform elevated another 6 cubits (9 ft.), stood the temple proper and its connected buildings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:8">Ezekiel 41:8</A>). This platform or basement is shown by the measurements to be 60 cubits broad (North and and South) and 105 cubits long (East and West)--5 cubits projecting into the eastern square. The ascent to the temple-porch was by 10 steps (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:49">Ezekiel 40:49</A>; Septuagint, the Revised Version margin). The temple itself was a building consisting, like Solomon's, of three parts--a porch at the entrance, 20 cubits (30 ft.) broad by 12 cubits (18 ft.) deep (so most, following the Septuagint, as required by the other measurements); the holy place or hekhal, 40 cubits (60 ft.) long by 20 cubits (30 ft.) broad; and the most holy place, 20 cubits by 20 (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:48,49">Ezekiel 40:48,49</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:1-4">41:1-4</A>); the measurements are internal. At the sides of the porch stood two pillars (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:49">Ezekiel 40:49</A>), corresponding to the Jachin and Boaz of the older Temple. The holy and the most holy places were separated by a partition 2 cubits in thickness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:3">Ezekiel 41:3</A>; so most interpret). The most holy place was empty; of the furniture of the holy place mention is made only of an altar of wood (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:22">Ezekiel 41:22</A>; see ALTAR, sec. A, III, 7; B, III, 3). Walls and doors were ornamented with cherubim and palm trees (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:18,25">Ezekiel 41:18,25</A>). The wall of the temple building was 6 cubits (9 ft.) in thickness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:5">Ezekiel 41:5</A>), and on the north, south, and west sides, as in Solomon's Temple, there were side-chambers in three stories, 30 in number (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:6">Ezekiel 41:6</A>; in each story?), with an outer wall 5 cubits (7 1/2 ft.) in thickness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:9">Ezekiel 41:9</A>). These chambers were, on the basement, 4 cubits broad; in the 2nd and 3rd stories, owing, as in the older Temple, to rebatements in the wall, perhaps 5 and 6 cubits broad respectively (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:6,7">Ezekiel 41:6,7</A>; in Solomon's Temple the side-chambers were 5, 6, and 7 cubits, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:6">1&nbsp;Kings 6:6</A>). These dimensions give a total external breadth to the house of 50 cubits (with a length of 100 cubits), leaving 5 cubits on either side and in the front as a passage round the edge of the platform on which the building stood (described as "that which was left") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:9,11">Ezekiel 41:9,11</A>). The western end, as far as the outer wall, was occupied, the whole breadth of the inner court, by a large building (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:12">Ezekiel 41:12</A>); all but a passage of 20 cubits (30 ft.) between it and the temple, belonging to what is termed "the separate place" (gizrah, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:12,13">Ezekiel 41:12,13</A>, etc.). The temple-platform being only 60 cubits broad, there remained a space of 20 cubits (30 ft.) on the north and south sides, running the entire length of the platform; this, continued round the back, formed the gizrah, or "separate place" just named. Beyond the gizrah for 50 cubits (75 ft.) were other chambers, apparently in two rows, the inner 100 cubits, the outer 50 cubits, long, with a walk of 10 cubits between (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+42:1-14">Ezekiel 42:1-14</A>; the passage, however, is obscure; some, as Keil, place the "walk" outside the chambers). These chambers were assigned to the priests for the eating of "the most holy things" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+42:13">Ezekiel 42:13</A>).
<P> See GALLERY.
<P> Such, in general, was the sanctuary of the prophet's vision, the outer and inner courts of which, and, crowning all, the temple itself, rising in successive terraces, presented to his inner eye an imposing spectacle which, in labored description, he seeks to enable his readers likewise to visualize.
<P> III. THE TEMPLE OF ZERUBBABEL
<P> I. Introductory.
<P> 1. The Decree of Cyrus:
<P> Forty-eight years after Nebuchadnezzar's destruction of the first Temple, the Babylonian empire came to an end (538 BC), and Persia became dominant under Cyrus. In the year following, Cyrus made a decree sanctioning the return of the Jews, and ordering the rebuilding of the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+36:23">2&nbsp;Chronicles 36:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:1-4">Ezra 1:1-4</A>). He not only caused the sacred vessels of the old Temple to be restored, but levied a tax upon his western provinces to provide materials for the building, besides what was offered willingly (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:6-11">Ezra 1:6-11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+6:3">6:3</A>). The relatively small number of exiles who chose to return for this work (40,000) were led by Sheshbazzar, "the prince of Judah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:11">Ezra 1:11</A>), whom some identify with Zerubbabel, likewise named "governor of Judah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hag+1:1">Haggai 1:1</A>). With these, if they were distinct was associated Joshua the high priest (in Ezra and Nehemiah called "Jeshua").
<P> 2. Founding of the Temple:
<P> The first work of Joshua and Zerubbabel was the building of the altar on its old site in the 7th month of the return (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+3:3">Ezra 3:3</A>). Masons and carpenters were engaged for the building of the house, and the Phoenicians were requisitioned for cedar wood from Lebanon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+3:7">Ezra 3:7</A>). In the 2nd year the foundations of the temple were laid with dignified ceremonial, amid rejoicing, and the weeping of the older men, who remembered the former house (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+3:8-13">Ezra 3:8-13</A>).
<P> 3. Opposition and Completion of the Work:
<P> The work soon met with opposition from the mixed population of Samaria, whose offer to join it had been refused; hostile representations, which proved successful, were made to the Persian king; from which causes the building was suspended about 15 years, till the 2nd year of Darius Hystaspis (520 BC; Ezr 4). On the other hand, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah stimulated the flagging zeal of the builders, and, new permission being obtained, the work was resumed, and proceeded so rapidly that in 516 BC the temple was completed, and was dedicated with joy (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+5">Ezra 5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+5:6">6</A>).
<P> II. The Temple Structure.
<P> 1. The House:
<P> Few details are available regarding this temple of Zerubbabel. It stood on the ancient site, and may have been influenced in parts of its plan by the descriptions of the temple in Ezekiel. The inferiority to the first Temple, alluded to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+3:12">Ezra 3:12</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hag+2:3">Haggai 2:3</A>, plainly cannot refer to its size, for its dimensions as specified in the decree of Cyrus, namely, 60 cubits in height, and 60 cubits in breadth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+6:3">Ezra 6:3</A>; there is no warrant for confining the 60 cubits of height to the porch only; compare Josephus, Ant, XI, i), exceed considerably those of the Temple of Solomon (side-chambers are no doubt included in the breadth). The greater glory of the former Temple can only refer to adornment, and to the presence in it of objects wanting in the second. The Mishna declares that the second temple lacked five things present in the first--the ark, the sacred fire, the shekhinah, the Holy Spirit, and the Urim and Thummim (Yoma', xxi.2).
<P> 2. Its Divisions and Furniture:
<P> The temple was divided, like its predecessor, into a holy and a most holy place, doubtless in similar proportions. In 1 Macc 1:22 mention is made of the "veil" between the two places. The most holy place, as just said, was empty, save for a stone on which the high priest, on the great Day of Atonement, placed his censer (Yoma' v.2). The holy place had its old furniture, but on the simpler scale of the tabernacle--a golden altar of incense, a single table of shewbread, one 7-branched candlestick. These were taken away by Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Macc 1:21,22). At the cleansing of the sanctuary after its profanation by this prince, they were renewed by Judas Maccabeus (1 Macc 4:41). Judas pulled down also the old desecrated altar, and built a new one (1 Macc 4:44).
<P> 3. Its Courts, Altar, etc.:
<P> The second temple had two courts--an outer and an inner (1 Macc 4:38,48; 9:54; Josephus, Ant, XIV, xvi, 2)--planned apparently on the model of those in Ezekiel. A.R.S. Kennedy infers from the measurements in the Haram that "the area of the great court of the second temple, before it was enlarged by Herod on the South and East, followed that of Ezekiel's outer court--that is, it measured 500 cubits each way with the sacred rock precisely in the center" (Expository Times, XX, 182). The altar on this old Sakhra site--the first thing of all to be "set on its base" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+3:3">Ezra 3:3</A>)--is shown by 1 Macc 4:47 and a passage quoted by Josephus from Hecataeus (Apion, I, xxii) to have been built of unhewn stones. Hecataeus gives its dimensions as a square of 20 cubits and 10 cubits in height. There seems to have been free access to this inner court till the time of Alexander Janneus (104-78 BC), who, pelted by the crowd as he sacrificed, fenced off the part of the court in front of the altar, so that no layman could come farther (Josephus, Ant, XIII, xiii, 5). The courts were colonnaded (Ant., XI, iv, 7; XIV, xvi, 2), and, with the house, had numerous chambers (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:44">Nehemiah 12:44</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+13:4">13:4</A>, etc.).
<P> A brief contemporary description of this Temple and its worship is given in Aristeas, 83-104. This writer's interest, however, was absorbed chiefly by the devices for carrying away the sacrificial blood and by the technique of the officiating priests.
<P> 4. Later Fortunes:
<P> The vicissitudes of this temple in its later history are vividly recorded in 1 Maccabees and in Josephus. In Ecclesiasticus 50 is given a glimpse of a certain Simon, son of Onias, who repaired the temple, and a striking picture is furnished of the magnificence of the worship in his time. The desecration and pillaging of the sanctuary by Antiochus, and its cleansing and restoration under Judas are alluded to above (see HASMONEANS; MACCABAEUS). At length Judea became an integral part of the Roman empire. In 66 BC Pompey, having taken the temple-hill, entered the most holy place, but kept his hands off the temple-treasures (Ant., XIV, iv, 4). Some years later Crassus carried away everything of value he could find (Ant., XIV, vii, 1). The people revolted, but Rome remained victorious. This brings us to the time of Herod, who was nominated king of Judea by Rome in 39 BC, but did not attain actual power until two years later.
<P> IV. THE TEMPLE OF HEROD
<P> I. Introductory.
<P> 1. Initiation of the Work:
<P> Herod became king de facto by the capture of Jerusalem in 37 BC. Some years later he built the fortress Antonia to the North of the temple (before 31 BC). Midway in his reign, assigning a religious motive for his purpose, he formed the project of rebuilding the temple itself on a grander scale (Josephus gives conflicting dates; in Ant, XV, xi, 1, he says "in his 18th year"; in BJ, I, xxi, 1, he names his 15th year; the latter date, as Schurer suggests (GJV4, I 369), may refer to the extensive preparations). To allay the distrust of his subjects, he undertook that the materials for the new building should be collected before the old was taken down; he likewise trained 1,000 priests to be masons and carpenters for work upon the sanctuary; 10,000 skilled workmen altogether were employed upon the task. The building was commenced in 20-19 BC. The naos, or temple proper, was finished in a year and a half, but it took 8 years to complete the courts and cloisters. The total erection occupied a much longer time (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:20">John 2:20</A>, "Forty and six years," etc.); indeed the work was not entirely completed till 64 AD-6 years before its destruction by the Romans.
<P> 2. Its Grandeur:
<P> Built of white marble, covered with heavy plates of gold in front and rising high above its marble-cloistered courts--themselves a succession of terraces--the temple, compared by Josephus to a snow-covered mountain (BJ, V, v, 6), was a conspicuous and dazzling object from every side. The general structure is succinctly described by G. A. Smith:
<P> "Herod's temple consisted of a house divided like its predecessor into the Holy of Holies, and the Holy Place; a porch; an immediate fore-court with an altar of burnt offering; a Court of Israel; in front of this a Court of Women; and round the whole of the preceding, a Court of the Gentiles" (Jerusalem, II, 502). On the "four courts," compare Josephus, Apion, II, viii.
<P> 3. Authorities:
<P> The original authorities on Herod's temple are chiefly the descriptions in Josephus (Ant., XV, xi, 3, 5; BJ, V, v, etc.), and the tractate Middoth in the Mishna. The data in these authorities, however, do not always agree. The most helpful modern descriptions, with plans, will be found, with differences in details, in Keil, Biblical Archaeology, I, 187; in Fergusson, Temples of the Jews; in the articles "Temple" in HDB (T. Witton Davies) and Encyclopedia Biblica (G. H. Box); in the important series of papers by A. R. S. Kennedy in The Expository Times (vol XX), "Some Problems of Herod's Temple" (compare his article "Temple" in one-vol DB); in Sanday's Sacred Sites of the Gospels (Waterhouse); latterly in G. A. Smith, Jerusalem, II, 499.
<P> 4. Measurements:
<P> Differences of opinion continue as to the sacred cubit. A. R. S. Kennedy thinks the cubit can be definitely fixed at 17,6 inches. (Expostory Times, XX, 24); G. A. Smith reckons it at 20,67 inches. (Jerusalem, II, 504); T. Witton Davies estimates it at about 18 in. (HDB, IV, 713), etc. W. S. Caldecott takes the cubit of Josephus and the Middoth to be 1 1/5 ft. It will suffice in this sketch to treat the cubit, as before, as approximately equivalent to 18 inches.
<P> II. The Temple and Its Courts.
<P> 1. Temple Area--Court of Gentiles:
<P> Josephus states that the area of Herod's temple was double that of its predecessor (BJ, I, xxi, 1). The Mishna (Mid., ii.2) gives the area as 500 cubits (roughly 750 ft.); Josephus (Ant., XV, xi, 3) gives it as a stadium (about 600 Greek ft.); but neither measure is quite exact. It is generally agreed that on its east, west and south sides Herod's area corresponded pretty nearly with the limits of the present Haram area (see JERUSALEM), but that it did not extend as far North as the latter (Kennedy states the difference at about 26 as compared with 35 acres, and makes the whole perimeter to be about 1,420 yards, ut supra, 66). The shape was an irregular oblong, broader at the North than at the South. The whole was surrounded by a strong wall, with several gates, the number and position of some of which are still matters of dispute. Josephus mentions four gates on the West (Ant., XV, xi, 5), the principal of which, named in Mid., i.3, "the gate of Kiponos," was connected by a bridge across the Tyropoeon with the city (where now is Wilson's Arch). The same authority speaks of two gates on the South. These are identified with the "Huldah" (mole) gates of the Mishna--the present Double and Triple Gates--which, opening low down in the wall, slope up in tunnel fashion into the interior of the court. The Mishna puts a gate also on the north and one on the east side. The latter may be represented by the modern Golden Gate--a Byzantine structure, now built up. This great court--known later as the "Court of the Gentiles," because open to everyone--was adorned with splendid porticos or cloisters. The colonnade on the south side--known as the Royal Porch--was specially magnificent. It consisted of four rows of monolithic marble columns--162 in all--with Corinthian capitals, forming three aisles, of which the middle was broader and double the height of the other two. The roofing was of carved cedar. The north, west, and east sides had only double colonnades. That on the east side was the "Solomon's Porch" of the New Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:23">John 10:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:19">5:19</A>). There were also chambers for officials, and perhaps a place of meeting for the Sanhedrin (beth din) (Josephus places this elsewhere). In the wide spaces of this court took place the buying and selling described in the Gospels (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</A> and parallel's; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:13">John 2:13</A>).
<P> 2. Inner Sanctuary Inclosure:
<P> (1) Wall, "Chel," "Coregh," Gates.
<P> In the upper or northerly part of this large area, on a much higher level, bounded likewise by a wall, was a second or inner enclosure--the "sanctuary" in the stricter sense (Josephus, BJ, V, v, 2)--comprising the court of the women, the court of Israeland the priests' court, with the temple itself (Josephus, Ant, XV, xi, 5). The surrounding wall, according to Josephus (BJ, V, v, 2), was 40 cubits high on the outside, and 25 on the inside--a difference of 15 cubits; its thickness was 5 cubits. Since, however, the inner courts were considerably higher than the court of the women, the difference in height may have been some cubits less in the latter than in the former (compare the different measurements in Kennedy, ut supra, 182), a fact which may explain the difficulty felt as to the number of the steps in the ascent (see below). Round the wall without, at least on three sides (some except the West), at a height of 12 (Mid.) or 14 (Jos) steps, was an embankment or terrace, known as the chel (fortification), 10 cubits broad (Mid. says 6 cubits high), and enclosing the whole was a low balustrade or stone parapet (Josephus says 3 cubits high) called the coregh, to which were attached at intervals tablets with notices in Greek and Latin, prohibiting entry to foreigners on pain of death (see PARTITION, THE MIDDLE WALL OF). From within the coregh ascent was made to the level of the chel by the steps aforesaid, and five steps more led up to the gates (the reckoning is probably to the lower level of the women's court). Nine gates, with two-storied gatehouses "like towers" (Josephus, BJ, V, v, 3), are mentioned, four on the North, four on the South, and one on the East--the last probably to be identified, though this is still disputed (Waterhouse, etc.), with the "Gate of Nicanor" (Mid.), or "Corinthian Gate" (Jos), which is undoubtedly "the Beautiful Gate" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:2,10">Acts 3:2,10</A> (see for identification, Kennedy, ut supra, 270). This principal gate received its names from being the gift of a wealthy Alexandrian Jew, Nicanor, and from its being made of Corinthian brass. It was of great size--50 cubits high and 40 cubits wide--and was richly adorned, its brass glittering like gold (Mid., ii.3). See BEAUTIFUL GATE. The other gates were covered with gold and silver (Josephus, BJ, V, v, 3).
<P> (2) Court of the Women.
<P> The eastern gate, approached from the outside by 12 steps (Mid., ii.3; Maimonides), admitted into the court of the women, so called because it was accessible to women as well as to men. Above its single colonnades were galleries reserved for the use of women. Its dimensions are given in the Mishna as 135 cubits square (Mid., ii.5), but this need not be precise. At its four corners were large roofless rooms for storage and other purposes. Near the pillars of the colonnades were 13 trumpet-shaped boxes for receiving the money-offerings of the people (compare the incident of the widow's mite, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+21:1">Luke 21:1</A>); for which reason, and because this court seems to have been the place of deposit of the temple-treasures generally, it bore the name "treasury" (gazophulakion, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+8:20">John 8:20</A>).
<P> See TREASURY.
<P> (3) Inner Courts:
<P> Court of Israel; Court of the Priests:
<P> From the women's court, the ascent was made by 15 semicircular steps (Mid., ii.5; on these steps the Levites chanted, and beneath them their instruments were kept) to the inner court, comprising, at different levels, the court of Israel and the court of the priests. Here, again, at the entrance, was a lofty, richly ornamented gate, which some, as said, prefer to regard as the Gate of Nicanor or Beautiful Gate. Probably, however, the view above taken, which places this gate at the outer entrance, is correct. The Mishna gives the total dimensions of the inner court as 187 cubits long (East to West) and 135 cubits wide (Mid., ii.6; v.1). Originally the court was one, but disturbances in the time of Alexander Janneus (104-78 BC) led, as formerly told, to the greater part being railed off for the exclusive use of the priests (Josephus, Ant, XIII, xiii, 5). In the Mishna the name "court of the priests" is used in a restricted sense to denote the space--11 cubits--between the altar and "the court of Israel" (see the detailed measurements in Mid., v.1). The latter--"the court of Israel"--2 1/2 cubits lower than "the court of the priests," and separated from it by a pointed fence, was likewise a narrow strip of only 11 cubits (Mid., ii.6; v.1). Josephus, with more probability, carries the 11 cubits of the "court of Israel" round the whole of the temple-court (BJ, V, vi). Waterhouse (Sacred Sites, 112) thinks 11 cubits too small for a court of male Israelites, and supposes a much larger enclosure, but without warrant in the authorities (compare Kennedy, ut supra, 183; G. A. Smith, Jerusalem, II, 508).
<P> (4) The Altar, etc.
<P> In the priests' court the principal object was the great altar of burnt offering, situated on the old site--the Sakhra--immediately in front of the porch of the temple (at 22 cubits distance--the space "between the temple and the altar" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</A>). The altar, according to the Mishna (Mid., iii.1), was 32 cubits square, and, like Ezekiel's, rose in stages, each diminishing by a cubit:
<P> one of 1 cubit in height, three of 5 cubits, which, with deduction of another cubit for the priests to walk on, left a square of 24 cubits at the top. It had four horns. Josephus, on the other hand, gives 50 cubits for the length and breadth, and 15 cubits for the height of the altar (BJ, V, v, 6)--his reckoning perhaps including a platform (a cubit high?) from which the height is taken (see ALTAR). The altar was built of unhewn stones, and had on the South a sloping ascent of like material, 32 cubits in length and 16 in width. Between temple and altar, toward the South, stood the "laver" for the priests. In the court, on the north side, were rings, hooks, and tables, for the slaughtering, flaying and suspending of the sacrificial victims.
<P> 3. The Temple Building:
<P> (1) House and Porch.
<P> Yet another flight of 12 steps, occupying most of the space between the temple-porch and the altar, led up to the platform (6 cubits high) on which stood the temple itself. This magnificent structure, built, as said before, of blocks of white marble, richly ornamented with gold on front and sides, exceeded in dimensions and splendor all previous temples. The numbers in the Mishna and in Josephus are in parts discrepant, but the general proportions can readily be made out. The building with its platform rose to the height of 100 cubits (150 ft.; the 120 cubits in Josephus, Ant, XV, xi, 3, is a mistake), and was 60 cubits (90 ft.) wide. It was fronted by a porch of like height, but with wings extending 20 cubits (30 ft.) on each side of the temple, making the total breadth of the vestibule 100 cubits (150 ft.) also. The depth of the porch was 10 or 11 cubits; probably at the wings 20 cubits (Jos). The entrance, without doors, was 70 cubits high and 25 cubits wide (Mid. makes 40 cubits high and 20 wide). Above it Herod placed a golden eagle, which the Jews afterward pulled down (Ant., XVII, vi, 3). The porch was adorned with gold.
<P> (2) "Hekhal" and "Debhir".
<P> Internally, the temple was divided, as before, into a holy place (hekhal) and a most holy (debhir)--the former measuring, as in Solomon's Temple, 40 cubits (60 ft.) in length, and 20 cubits (30 ft.) in breadth; the height, however, was double that of the older Temple--60 cubits (90 ft.; thus Keil, etc., following Josephus, BJ, V, v, 5). Mid., iv.6, makes the height only 40 cubits; A. R. S. Kennedy and G. A. Smith make the debhir a cube--20 cubits in height only. In the space that remained above the holy places, upper rooms (40 cubits) were erected. The holy place was separated from the holiest by a partition one cubit in thickness, before which hung an embroidered curtain or "veil"--that which was rent at the death of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:51">Matthew 27:51</A> and parallel's; Mid., iv.7, makes two veils, with a space of a cubit between them). The Holy of Holies was empty; only a stone stood, as in the temple of Zerubbabel, on which the high priest placed his censer on the Day of Atonement (Mishna, Yoma', v.2). In the holy place were the altar of incense, the table of shewbread (North), and the seven-branched golden candlestick (South). Representations of the two latter are seen in the carvings on the Arch of Titus (see SHEWBREAD, TABLE OF; CANDLESTICK, THE GOLDEN). The spacious entrance to the holy place had folding doors, before which hung a richly variegated Babylonian curtain. Above the entrance was a golden vine with clusters as large as a man (Josephus, Ant, XV, xi, 3; BJ, V, v, 4).
<P> (3) The Side-Chambers.
<P> The walls of the temple appear to have been 5 cubits thick, and against these, on the North, West, and South, were built, as in Solomon's Temple, side-chambers in three stories, 60 cubits in height, and 10 cubits in width (the figures, however, are uncertain), which, with the outer walls, made the entire breadth of the house 60 or 70 cubits. Mid., iv.3, gives the number of the chambers as 38 in all. The roof, which Keil speaks of as "sloping" (Bib. Archaeology, I, 199), had gilded spikes to keep off the birds. A balustrade surrounded it 3 cubits high. Windows are not mentioned, but there would doubtless be openings for light into the holy place from above the sidechambers.
<P> III. New Testament Associations of Herod's Temple.
<P> 1. Earlier Incidents:
<P> Herod's temple figures so prominently in New Testament history that it is not necessary to do more than refer to some of the events of which it was the scene. It was here, before the incense altar, that the aged Zacharias had the vision which assured him that he should not die childless (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:11">Luke 1:11</A>). Here, in the women's court, or treasury, on the presentation by Mary, the infant Jesus was greeted by Simeon and Anna (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+2:27">Luke 2:27</A>). In His 12th year the boy Jesus amazed the temple rabbis by His understanding and answers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+2:46">Luke 2:46</A>).
<P> 2. Jesus in the Temple:
<P> The chronological sequence of the Fourth Gospel depends very much upon the visits of Jesus to the temple at the great festivals (see JESUS CHRIST). At the first of these occurred the cleansing of the temple-court--the court of the Gentiles--from the dealers that profaned it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:13">John 2:13</A>), an incident repeated at the close of the ministry (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</A> and parallel's). When the Jews, on the first occasion, demanded a sign, Jesus spoke of the temple of His body as being destroyed and raised up in three days (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:19">John 2:19</A>), eliciting their retort, "Forty and six years was this temple in building," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:20">John 2:20</A>). This may date the occurrence about 27 AD. At the second cleansing He not only drove out the buyers and sellers, but would not allow anyone to carry anything through this part of the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:15-17">Mark 11:15-17</A>). In Joh His zeal flamed out because it was His Father's house; in Mk, because it was a house of prayer for all nations (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+56:7">Isaiah 56:7</A>). With this non-exclusiveness agrees the word of Jesus to the woman of Samaria:
<P> "The hour cometh, when neither in this mountain (in Samaria), nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+4:21">John 4:21</A>). During the two years following His first visit, Jesus repeatedly, at festival times, walked in the temple-courts, and taught and disputed with the Jews. We find Him in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+5">John 5</A> at "a feast" (Passover or Purim?); in John 7; 8, at "the feast of tabernacles," where the temple-police were sent to apprehend Him (7:32,45), and where He taught "in the treasury" (8:20); in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:22">John 10:22</A>, at "the feast of the dedication" in winter, walking in "Solomon's Porch." His teaching on these occasions often started from some familiar temple scene--the libations of water carried by the priests to be poured upon the altar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+7:37">John 7:37</A>), the proselytes (Greeks even) in the great portico (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+12:20">John 12:20</A>), etc. Of course Jesus, not being of the priestly order, never entered the sanctuary; His teaching took place in the several courts open to laymen, generally in the "treasury" (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+8:20">John 8:20</A>).
<P> 3. The Passion-Week:
<P> The first days of the closing week of the life of Jesus--the week commencing with the Triumphal Entry--were spent largely in the temple. Here He spoke many parables (Mt 21; 22 and parallel's); here He delivered His tremendous arraignment of the Pharisees (Mt 23 and parallel's); here, as He "sat down over against the treasury," He beheld the people casting in their gifts, and praised the poor widow who cast in her two mites above all who cast in of their abundance (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</A> and parallel's). It was on the evening of His last day in the temple that His disciples drew His attention to "the goodly stones and offerings" (gifts for adornment) of the building (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+21:5">Luke 21:5</A> and parallel's) and heard from His lips the astonishing announcement that the days were coming--even in that generation--in which there should not be left one stone upon another (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+21:6">Luke 21:6</A> and parallel's). The prediction was fulfilled to the letter in the destruction of the temple by the Romans in 70 AD.
<P> 4. Apostolic Church:
<P> Seven weeks after the crucifixion the Pentecost of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2">Acts 2</A> was observed. The only place that fulfils the topographical conditions of the great gatherings is Solomon's Porch. The healing of the lame man (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</A>) took place at the "door .... called Beautiful" of the temple, and the multitude after the healing ran together into "Solomon's Porch" or portico (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</A>). Where also were the words of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+24:53">Luke 24:53</A>, they "were continually in the temple, blessing God," and after Pentecost (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</A>), "day by day, continuing stedfastly .... in the temple," etc., so likely to be fulfilled? For long the apostles continued the methods of their Master in daily teaching in the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+4:1">Acts 4:1</A>). Many years later, when Paul visited Jerusalem for the last time, he was put in danger of his life from the myriads of Jewish converts "all zealous for the law" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</A>), who accused him of profaning the temple by bringing Greeks into its precincts, i.e. within the coregh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:28-30">Acts 21:28-30</A>). But Christianity had now begun to look farther afield than the temple. Stephen, and after him Saul, who became Paul, preached that "the Most High dwelleth not in houses made with hands" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+7:48">Acts 7:48</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:24">17:24</A>), though Paul himself attended the temple for ceremonial and other purposes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</A>).
<P> 5. The Temple in Christian Thought:
<P> From the time that the temple ceased to exist, the Talmud took its place in Jewish estimation; but it is in Christianity rather than in Judaism that the temple has a perpetual existence. The New Testament writers make no distinction between one temple and another. It is the idea rather than the building which is perpetuated in Christian teaching. The interweaving of temple associations with Christian thought and life runs through the whole New Testament. Jesus Himself supplied the germ for this development in the word He spoke concerning the temple of His body (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:19,21">John 2:19,21</A>). Paul, notwithstanding all he had suffered from Jews and Jewish Christians, remained saturated with Jewish ideas and modes of thought. In one of his earliest Epistles he recognizes the "Jerus that is above" as "the mother of us all" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</A> the King James Version). In another, the "man of sin" is sitting "in the temple of God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:4</A>). The collective church (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+3:16,17">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:16,17</A>), but also the individual believer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+6:19">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19</A>), is a temple. One notable passage shows how deep was the impression made upon Paul's mind by the incident connected with Trophimus the Ephesian (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:29">Acts 21:29</A>). That "middle wall of partition" which so nearly proved fatal to him then was no longer to be looked for in the Christian church (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</A>), which was "a holy temple" in the Lord (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</A>). It is naturally in the Epistle to the Hebrews that we have the fullest exposition of ideas connected with the temple, although here the form of allusion is to the tabernacle rather than the temple (see TABERNACLE; compare Westcott on Hebrews, 233). The sanctuary and all it included were but representations of heavenly things. Finally, in Revelation, the vision is that of the heavenly temple itself (11:19). But the church--professing Christendom?--is a temple measured by God's command (11:1,2). The climax is reached in 21:22-23:
<P> "I saw no temple therein (i.e. in the holy city): for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof .... and the lamp thereof is the Lamb." Special ordinances are altogether superseded.
<P> LITERATURE.
<P> In general on the temples see Keil, Biblical Archaeology, I, in which the older literature is mentioned; Fergusson, Temples of the Jews; Comms. on K, Chronicles, Ezr, Neh, and Ezk; articles in the dicts. and encs (DB, HDB, EB); G. A. Smith, Jerusalem and similar works. On Solomon's Temple, compare Benzinger, Heb. Archaologie. On Ezekiel's temple, see Skinner's "Book of Ezekiel" in Expositor's Bible. On Zerubbabel's temple, compare W. Shaw Caldecott, The Second Temple in Jerusalem. The original authorities on Herod's temple are chiefly Josephus, Ant, XV, xi, and BJ, V, v; and the Mishna, Middoth, ii (this section of the Middoth, from Barclay's Talmud, may be seen in App. I of Fergusson's work above named). The German literature is very fully given in Schurer, HJP, I, 1, 438 (GJV4, I, 392 f). See also the articles of A. R. S. Kennedy in Expository Times, XX, referred to above, and P. Waterhouse, in Sanday, Sacred Sites of the Gospels, 106. On symbolism, compare Westcott, Hebrews, 233. See also articles in this Encyclopedia on parts, furniture, and utensils of the temple, under their several headings.
