             <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"><B>Leeks</B></FONT> <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">(Heb. <I>chatsir</I> ). The leek was a bulbous vegetable resembling the onion. Its botanical name is <I>Allium porrum.</I> The Israelites in the wilderness longed for the leeks and onions of Egypt. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/11-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/11-5.html">Numbers 11:5</a> ) The word <I>chatsir</I> , which in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/11-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/11-5.html">Numbers 11:5</a> ) is translated <I>leeks</I> , occurs twenty times in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew term, which properly denotes <I>grass</I> , is derived from a root signifying "to be green," and may therefore stand in this passage for any green food --lettuce, endive, etc.; it would thus be applied somewhat in the same manner as we use the term "greens;" yet as the <I>chatsir</I> is mentioned together with onions and garlic in the text, and as the most ancient versions unanimously understand <I>leeks</I> by the Hebrew word, we may be satisfied with our own translation. </FONT></body></html>
