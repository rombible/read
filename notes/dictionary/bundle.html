<P> Represents in English Versions of the Bible the words tseror, from a verb meaning "cramp" "bind," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+42:35">Genesis 42:35</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25:29">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+1:13">Song of Solomon 1:13</A>); tsebheth, from a verb probably meaning "to grasp" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+2:16">Ruth 2:16</A>); and deseme, from deo, "to tie up," "bind," hence, literally "bundle," just as the English word is derived from "bind" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:30">Matthew 13:30</A>); and plethos, properly "multitude." The custom of binding up precious things in bundles (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+1:13">Song of Solomon 1:13</A>) is the basis of the very interesting metaphor in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25:29">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:29</A>: "The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh thy God," or perhaps better, "in the bundle of the living in the care of Yahweh"--an assurance of perfect safety.
