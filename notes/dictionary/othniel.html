            <P><B>OTHNIEL</B><P> oth'-ni-el (`othni'el):
<P> A hero in Israel, son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. He conquered Kiriath-sepher, later known as Debir, in the territory of Judah in the days of Joshua, and was given the daughter of Caleb, Achsah, to wife as a reward (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:17">Joshua 15:17</A>, parallel found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:13">Judges 1:13</A>). He later smote Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, whom the children of Israel had served 8 years, and thus not only saved the Israelites, but by reviving national sentiment among them (compare Ant, V, iv, 3), and reestablishing government, became the first of those hero-rulers known as "judges." The effects of his victory lasted an entire generation (40 years, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:9-11">Judges 3:9-11</A>). He had a son named Hathath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:13">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:13</A>) and probably another named Meonothai (compare recensio Luciana of Septuagint, at the place). In the days of David we find a family bearing the name of Othniel, from which came Heldai the Metophathite, captain of the twelfth month (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:15</A>).
