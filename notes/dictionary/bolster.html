            <P><B>BOLSTER</B><P> bol'-ster:
<P> Found in the King James Version only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+19:13,16">1&nbsp;Samuel 19:13,16</A>, "Behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goat's hair at the head thereof" (the King James Version "for his bolster"), and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+26:7,11,12,16">1&nbsp;Samuel 26:7,11,12,16</A>, "Saul lay sleeping .... with his spear stuck in the ground at his head." "Bolster" in these passages in the King James Version was used to translate a Hebrew word whose true significance is "the place of the head," or "the head-place." It will be noted that it has disappeared from the Revised Version (British and American), which rightly has throughout "head," instead of "bolster."
