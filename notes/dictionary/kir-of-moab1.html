The name occurs only in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/15-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/15-1.html">Isaiah 15:1</a> ) though the place is probably referred to under the names of Kir-heres, Kir-harseth, etc. It is almost identical with the name <I>Kerak</I> , by which the site of an important city in a high and very strong position at the southeast of the Dead Sea is known at this day. Its situation is truly remarkable. It is built upon the top of a steep hill, surrounded by a deep and narrow valley, which again is completely enclosed by mountains rising higher than the town and overlooking it on all sides. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
