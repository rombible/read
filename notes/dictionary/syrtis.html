<P> the Revised Version (British and American) form for "quicksands" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:17">Acts 27:17</A>. These sandbanks, off the northern coast of Africa, have from early times been regarded as a source of danger to mariners. Virgil refers to them (Aen. iv.40 f). In Paul's voyage, the ship, driven by a tempestuous wind, Euraquilo, was in peril of being cast-upon them.
