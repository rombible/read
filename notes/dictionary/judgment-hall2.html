The site of Pilates praetorium in Jerusalem has given rise to much dispute, some supposing it to be the palace of King Herod, others the tower of Antonia; but it was probably the latter, which was then and long afterward the citadel of Jerusalem. <LI>In ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/23-35.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/23-35.html">Acts 23:35</a> ) Herods judgment hall or praetorium in Caesarea was doubtless a part of that magnificent range of buildings the erection of which by King Herod is described in Josephus. The word "palace," or "Caesars court." in the Authorized Version of ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/philemon/1-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/philemon/1-13.html">Philemon 1:13</a> ) is a translation of the same word praetorium. It may here have denoted the quarter of that detachment of the praetorian guards which was in immediate attendance upon the emperor, and had barracks in Mount Palatine at Rome. </OL></FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
