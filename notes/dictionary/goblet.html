            <P><B>GOBLET</B><P> gob'-let ('aggan):
<P> A bowl or basin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+7:2">Song of Solomon 7:2</A>), the only place where the word is used. `Aggan is used in the plural in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+24:6">Exodus 24:6</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+22:24">Isaiah 22:24</A>, and is translated "basins" and "cups." These "basins" were used to hold the blood of the sacrifices and must have been of moderate size. The "cups" were bowl-shaped vessels and belonged evidently to the smaller class of vessels used in a house.
