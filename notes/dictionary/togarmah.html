            <P><B>TOGARMAH</B><P> to-gar'-ma (~togharmah]; Thorgama, Thergama, Thurgama, Thurgaba; Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) Thorgoma):
<P> 1. Its Forms:
<P> A Suggested Identification:
<P> The 3rd son of Gomer, and grandson of Japheth, his brothers being Ashkenaz and Riphath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:3">Genesis 10:3</A>). The meaning of the name is doubtful. Grimm (Gesch. deutsch. Sprache, II, 325) suggests Sanskr. toka, "tribe," and arma = Armenia. Etymological and other difficulties stand in the way of French Delitzsch's identification of Togarmah with the Assyrian Til-garimmu, "hill of Garimmu," or, possibly, "of the bone-heap," a fortress of Melitene, on the borders of Tabal (Tubal).
<P> 2. Probably Armenia or a Tract Connected Therewith:
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:14">Ezekiel 27:14</A> Togarmah is mentioned after Tubal, Javan and Mesech as supplying horses and mules to the Tyrians, and in 38:6 it is said to have supplied soldiers to the army of Gog (Gyges of Lydia). In the Assyrian inscriptions horses came from Kusu (neighborhoed of Cappadocia), Andia and Mannu, to the North of Assyria. Both Kiepert and Dillmann regard Togarmah as having been Southeastern Armenia, and this is at present the general opinion. The ancient identification of their country with Togarmah by the Armenians, though correct, is probably due to the Septuagint transposition of "g" and "r" (Thorgama for Togarmah), which has caused them to see therein the name of Thorgom, father of Haik, the founder of their race (Moses of Khor, I, 4, secs. 9-11). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:14">Ezekiel 27:14</A> (Swete) alone has "g" before "r":
<P> Thaigrama. The name "Armenia" dates from the 5th century BC.
