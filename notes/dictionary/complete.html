<P> In the King James Version for pleroo, the verb ordinarily used for the coming to pass of what had been predicted. the King James Version translates this "complete" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+2:10">Colossians 2:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+4:12">4:12</A> to express the final and entire attainment of what is treated, leaving nothing beyond to be desired or hoped for; otherwise rendered in the Revised Version (British and American) ("made full"). In the Revised Version (British and American), c. appears once for Greek artios, from aro, "to join," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+3:17">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:17</A>, in sense of "accurately fitted for," where the King James Version has "perfect."
