In consequence of its geographical position it formed the most direct communication between the Ionian and AEgean seas. A remarkable feature was the <I>Acrocorinthus,</I> a vast citadel of rock, which rises abruptly to the height of 2000 feet above the level of the sea, and the summit of which is so extensive that it once contained a whole town. The situation of Corinth, and the possession of its eastern and western harbors, Cenchreae and Lechaeum, are the secrets of its history. Corinth was a place of great mental activity, as well as of commercial and manufacturing enterprise. Its wealth was so celebrated as to be proverbial; so were the vice and profligacy of its inhabitants. The worship of Venus where was attended with shameful licentiousness. Corinth is still an episcopal see. The city has now shrunk to a wretched village, ont he old site and bearing the old name, which, however, is corrupted into <I>Gortho</I> . St. Paul preached here, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-11.html">Acts 18:11</a> ) and founded a church, to which his Epistles to the Corinthians are addressed.
