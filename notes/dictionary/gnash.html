            <P><B>GNASH</B><P> nash (charaq; brugmos):
<P> "Gnash" is used of grinding or striking together the teeth in rage, pain or misery of disappointment. In the Old Testament it is the translation of charak, a mimetic word, and represents for the most part rage, anger, hatred (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+16:9">Job 16:9</A>, "He gnasheth upon me with his teeth," the Revised Version (British and American) "hath gnashed upon me"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+35:16">Psalms 35:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+37:12">37:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+112:10">112:10</A>, grief; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+2:16">Lamentations 2:16</A>, contempt or derision); brucho, "to gnash the teeth in rage," indicates anger, rage, Septuagint for charaq (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+7:54">Acts 7:54</A>, of Stephen, "They gnashed on him with their teeth"). The several instances of brugmos, "gnashing," in the Gospels seem to express disappointment rather than anger (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+8:12">Matthew 8:12</A>,"There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth," the Revised Version (British and American) "the weeping and the gnashing of teeth"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:42,50">Matthew 13:42,50</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+22:13">22:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:51">24:51</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+25:30">25:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+13:28">Luke 13:28</A>--a vivid representation of the misery of disappointed expectations; compare Ecclesiasticus 30:10, "lest thou shalt gnash thy teeth in the end," gomphiazo, "to have the teeth set on edge"); trizo (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:18">Mark 9:18</A>), which means "to give out a creaking, grating sound," "to screak," is used in the New Testament (in the above instance only) to mean "to grate or gnash with the teeth," indicating the effect of a paroxysm, the Revised Version (British and American) "grindeth his teeth."
