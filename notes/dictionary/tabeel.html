            <P><B>TABEEL</B><P> ta'-be-el:
<P> A name meaning "good is God," borne by two persons in the Old Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:6">Isaiah 7:6</A>, the King James Version, "Tabeal").
<P> (1) The father of the man whom the kings of Israel and Damascus planned to place upon the throne of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:6">Isaiah 7:6</A>). The form of the name Tabhe'el, suggests that he was a Syrian; his son evidently was a tool of Rezin, king of Damascus. The name is vocalized so as to read Tebeal (Tabhe'al), which might be translated "good for nothing," though some explain it as a pausal form, with the ordinary meaning. The change, probably due to a desire to express contempt, is very slight in Hebrew.
<P> (2) A Persian official in Samaria (Tabhe'el) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:7">Ezra 4:7</A>). All that is known of him is that he joined with other officials in sending a letter to Artaxerxes for the purpose of hindering the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem.
<P> F. C. Eiselen
