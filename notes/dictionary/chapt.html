            <P><B>CHAPT</B><P> (chathath):
<P> The Hebrew term chathath means "broken," "terrified" or "dismayed." This term as it occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+14:4">Jeremiah 14:4</A> is rendered "chapt" in English Versions of the Bible, "cracked" in the American Standard Revised Version, and "dismayed" in the Revised Version, margin. Inasmuch as the Hebrew term means "broken," it is not incorrectly rendered "chapt" or "chapped," which means to be cracked Open.
