            <P><B>PERVERSE</B><P> per-vurs':
<P> The group "perverse, -ly, -ness," "act perversely" in the King James Version represents nearly 20 Hebrew words, of which, however, most are derivatives of the stems `awah, luz, `aqash. The Revised Version (British and American) has made few changes. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+6:30">Job 6:30</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "mischievous" is better for the taste of a thing, and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+59:3">Isaiah 59:3</A> greater emphasis is gained by the Revised Version (British and American) "wickedness." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+9:9">Ezekiel 9:9</A>, "wresting of judgment" is perhaps too concrete, and "perverseness" is kept in the margin (inverted in the King James Version). the Revised Version margin "headlong" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+22:32">Numbers 22:32</A> is over-literal, but in 23:21 the American Standard Revised Version margin's "trouble" is a distinct improvement.
