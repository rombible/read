            <P><B>SENSES</B><P> sen'-siz:
<P> The translation of aistheterion (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</A>, "those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil"). The word means, primarily, the seat of the senses, the region of feeling; in the Septuagint of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+4:19">Jeremiah 4:19</A>, it represents the Hebrew qir, "the walls of the heart" (see the Revised Version (British and American)), and is used to denote the internal sense or faculty of perceiving and judging, which in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</A> is regarded as becoming perfected by use or exercise (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:12">Ephesians 4:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+4:7">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+3:18">2&nbsp;Peter 3:18</A>).
<P> In 2 Esdras 10:36 we have "Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream?" Latin sensus, here "mind" rather than "sense."
<P> W. L. Walker
