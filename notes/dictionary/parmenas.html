            <P><B>PARMENAS</B><P> par'-me-nas (Parmenas):
<P> A Greek name, an abbreviated form of Parmenides. Parmenas was one of "the seven" chosen by the people and appointed by the apostles to superintend the daily distribution to the Christian poor of Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</A>). Tradition states that he was martyred at Philippi, in the reign of Trajan, but his name does not appear again in Scripture.
