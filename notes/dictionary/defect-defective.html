            <P><B>DEFECT; DEFECTIVE</B><P> de-fekt', de-fekt'-iv (hettema, "loss," "a defect"):
<P> Occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+6:7">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:7</A>: "Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you (the King James Version "there is utterly a fault among you"), that ye have lawsuits one with another." "Defect" means "want or absence of something necessary for completeness" (the Revised Version, margin "a loss to you"). The meaning of the passage in the Revised Version (British and American) is that when Christians have lawsuits one with another it produces a lack of something which brings them short of completeness, they suffer a spiritual loss or defeat, and perhaps defect is not quite strong enough fully to express that idea.
<P> Defective:
<P> Sirach 49:4 the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) "committed trespass."
<P> A. W. Fortune
