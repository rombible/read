( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/28-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/28-15.html">Acts 28:15</a> ) The distances, reckoning southward from Rome are given as follows in the Antonine Itinerary: "to Aricia, 16 miles; to Three Taverns, 17 miles; to Appii Forum, 10 miles;" and, comparing this with what is still observed along the line of road, we have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that "Three Taverns" was near the modern <I>Cisterna</I> . Just at this point a road came in from Antium on the coast. There is no doubt that "Three Taverns" was a frequent meeting-place of travellers. </FONT></body></html>
