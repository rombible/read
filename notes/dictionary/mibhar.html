            <P><B>MIBHAR</B><P> mib'-har (mibhchar, "choice"(?)):
<P> According to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:38">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:38</A>, the name of one of David's heroes. No such name, however, occurs in the parallel passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:36">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:36</A>). A comparison of the two records makes it probable that mibhchar is a corruption of mitstsbhah = "from Zobah," which completes the designation of the former name, Nathan of Zobah. The concluding words of the verse, Ben-Hagri = "the son of Hagri," will then appear as a misreading of Bani ha-gadhi = "Bani, the Gadite," thus bringing the two records into accord.
