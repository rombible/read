The alliance between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, commenced by his father and Jehoshaphat, was very close throughout his reign. We first find him associated with Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom in a war against the Moabites. The three armies were in the utmost danger of perishing for want of water. The piety of Jehoshaphat suggested an inquiry of Jehovah, thorough Elisha. After reproving Jehoram, Elisha, for Jehoshaphats sake, inquired of Jehovah, and received the promise of an abundant supply of water, and of a great victory over the Moabites; a promise which was immediately fulfilled. The allies pursued them with great slaughter into their own land, which they utterly ravaged and destroyed most of its cities. Kirharaseth alone remained, the there the king of Moab made his last stand. An attempt to break through the besieging army having failed, he resorted to the desperate expedient of offering up his eldest son, as a burnt offering, upon the wall of the city, in the sight of the enemy. Upon this the Israelites retired and returned to their own land.

A little later, when war broke out between Syria and Israel, we find Elisha befriending Jehoram; but when the terrible famine in Samaria arose, the king immediately attributed the evil to Elisha, and determined to take away his life. The providential interposition by which both Elishas life was saved the city delivered is narrated ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/7-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/7-1.html">2&nbsp;Kings 7:1</a> ) ... and Jehoram appears to have returned to friendly feeling toward Elisha. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/8-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/8-4.html">2&nbsp;Kings 8:4</a> ) It was soon after these vents that the revolution in Syria predicted by Elisha took place, giving Jehoram a good opportunity of recovering Ramoth-gilead from the Syrians. he accordingly made an alliance with his nephew Ahaziah, who had just succeeded Joram on the throne of Judah, and the two kings proceeded to occupy Ramoth-gilead by force. The expedition was an unfortunate one. Jehoram was wounded in battle, and obliged to return to Jezreel to be healed of his wounds.

Jehoram, going out to meet him, fell pierced by an arrow from Jehus bow on the very plot of ground which Ahab had wrested from Naboth the Jezreelite; thus fulfilling to the letter the prophecy of Elijah. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/21-29.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/21-29.html">1&nbsp;Kings 21:29</a> ) With the life of Jehoram ended the dynasty of Omri. <LI>Eldest son of Jehoshaphat, succeeded his father on the throne of Judah at the age of 32, and reigned eight years, from B.C. 893-2 to 885-4. As soon as he was fixed on the throne, he put his six brothers to death, with many of the chief nobles of the land. He then, probably at the instance of his wife Athaliah the daughter of Ahab, proceeded to establish the worship of Baal. A prophetic writing from the aged prophet Elijah, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/21-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/21-12.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 21:12</a> ) failed to produce any good effect upon him. The remainder of his reign was a series of calamities. First the Edomites, who had been tributary to Jehoshaphat, revolted from his dominion and established their permanent independence. Next Libnah, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/19-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/19-8.html">2&nbsp;Kings 19:8</a> ) rebelled against him. Then followed invasion by armed bands of Philistines and of Arabians, who stormed the kings palace, put his wives and all his children, except his youngest son Ahaziah, to death, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/22-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/22-1.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 22:1</a> ) or carried them into captivity, and plundered all his treasures. he died of a terrible disease.
