            <P><B>OG</B><P> (`ogh; Og):
<P> King of Bashan, whose territory, embracing 60 cities, was conquered by Moses and the Israelites immediately after the conquest of Sihon, king of the Amorites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:33-35">Numbers 21:33-35</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:1-12">Deuteronomy 3:1-12</A>). The defeat took place at Edrei, one of the chief of these cities (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:33">Numbers 21:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:4">Joshua 12:4</A>), and Og and his people were "utterly destroyed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:6">Deuteronomy 3:6</A>). Og is described as the last of the REPHAIM (which see), or giant-race of that district, and his giant stature is borne out by what is told in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:11">Deuteronomy 3:11</A> of the dimensions of his "bedstead of iron" (`eres barzel), 9 cubits long and 4 broad (13 1/2 ft. by 6 ft.), said to be still preserved at Rabbath of Ammon when the verse describing it was written. It is not, of course, necessary to conclude that Og's own height, though immense, was as great as this. Some, however, prefer to suppose that what is intended is "a sarcophagus of black basalt," which iron-like substance abounds in the Hauran. The conquered territory was subsequently bestowed on the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:33">Numbers 32:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:12,13">Deuteronomy 3:12,13</A>). Other references to Og are <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:4">Deuteronomy 1:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+4:47">4:47</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+31:4">31:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+2:10">Joshua 2:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+9:10">9:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:12,30">13:12,30</A>). The memory of this great conquest lingered all through the national history (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+135:11">Psalms 135:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+136:20">136:20</A>). On the conquest, compare Stanley, Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church, I, 185-87.
