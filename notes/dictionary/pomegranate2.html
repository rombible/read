The Romans gave it the name of Punica, as the tree was introduced from Carthage. It belongs to the natural order <I>Myrtaceae</I> (Myrtle), being, however, rather a tall bush than a tree, The foliage is dark green, the flowers are crimson, the fruit, which is about the size of art orange, is red when which in Palestine is about the middle of October. It contains a quantity of juice. Mention is made in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/song-of-solomon/8-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/song-of-solomon/8-2.html">Solomon 8:2</a> ) of spiced wine of the juice of the pomegranate. The rind is used in the manufacture of morocco leather, and together with the bark is sometimes used medicinally.

Carved figures of the pomegranate adorned the tops of the pillars in Solomons temple, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/7-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/7-18.html">1 Kings 7:18</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/7-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/7-20.html">1 Kings 7:20</a> ) etc.; and worked representations of this fruit, in blue, purple and scarlet, ornamented the hem of the robe of the ephod.
