It consisted simply of a sole attached to the foot by thongs. We have express notice of the thong (Authorized Version "shoe latchet") in several passages, notably ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/14-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/14-23.html">Genesis 14:23</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/5-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/5-27.html">Isaiah 5:27</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/1-7.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/1-7.html">Mark 1:7</a> ) Sandals were worn by all classes of society in Palestine, even by the very poor; and both the sandal and the thong or shoe-latchet were so cheap and common that they passed into a proverb for the most insignificant thing. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/14-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/14-23.html">Genesis 14:23</a> ) Ecclus. 46;13, They were dispensed with in-doors, and were only put on by persons about to undertake some business away from their homes. During mealtimes the feet were uncovered. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/7-38.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/7-38.html">Luke 7:38</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/13-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/13-5.html">John 13:5</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/13-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/13-6.html">John 13:6</a> ) It was a mark of reverence to cast off the shoes in approaching a place or person of eminent sanctity. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/3-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/3-5.html">Exodus 3:5</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/5-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/5-15.html">Joshua 5:15</a> ) It was also an indication of violent emotion, or of mourning, if a person appeared barefoot in public. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/15-30.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/15-30.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:30</a> ) To carry or to unloose a persons sandal was a menial office, betokening great inferiority on the part of the person performing it.
