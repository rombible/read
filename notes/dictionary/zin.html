            <P><B>ZIN</B><P> zin (tsin; Sin):
 (1) A town in the extreme South of Judah, on the line separating that province from Edom, named between the ascent of Akrabbim and Kadesh-barnea (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:4">Numbers 34:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:3">Joshua 15:3</A>). It must have lain somewhere between Wady el-Fiqra (the ascent of Akrabbim?) and `Ain Qadis (Kadesh-barnea); but the site has not been recovered.
<P> (2) The Wilderness of Zin is the tract deriving its name from the town (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:3">Numbers 34:3</A>). It is identified with the wilderness of Kadesh in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:36">Numbers 33:36</A>; while in other places Kadesh is said to be in the wilderness of Zin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:1">Numbers 20:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+27:14">27:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:51">Deuteronomy 32:51</A>). We may take it that the two names refer to the same region. The spies, who set out from Kadesh-barnea, explored the land from the wilderness of Zin northward (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+13:21">Numbers 13:21</A>; compare 32:8). It bordered with Judah "at the uttermost part of the south" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:1">Joshua 15:1</A>). In this wilderness Moses committed the offense which cost him his hope of entering the promised land (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+27:14">Numbers 27:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:51">Deuteronomy 32:51</A>). It is identical with the uplands lying to the North and Northwest of the wilderness of Paran, now occupied by the `Azazimeh Arabs.
