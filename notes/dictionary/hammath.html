            <P><B>HAMMATH</B><P> ham'-ath (chammath, "hot spring"):
<P> (1) "The father of the house of Rechab" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:55">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:55</A>).
<P> (2) One of the fenced cities of Naphtali, named with Zer, Rakkath and Chinnereth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:35">Joshua 19:35</A>). It is doubtless identical with Emmaus mentioned by Josephus (Ant., XVIII, ii, 3; BJ, IV, i, 3) as near Tiberias, on the shore of the lake of Gennesareth. It is represented by the modern el-Chammam, nearly 2 miles South of Tiberias. It was, of course, much nearer the ancient Tiberias, which lay South of the present city. The hot baths here, "useful for healing," in the time of Josephus, have maintained their reputation. In recent years, indeed, there has been a marked increase in the number of sick persons from all parts who visit the baths. The waters are esteemed specially valuable for rheumatism and skin troubles. In the large public bath the water has a temperature of over 140 degree Fahr. Parts of the ancient fortification still cling to the mountain side above the baths; and the remains of an aqueduct which brought fresh water from sources in the Southwest may be traced along the face of the slopes. Hammath is identical with Hammon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:76">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:76</A>); and probably also with Hammoth-dor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:32">Joshua 21:32</A>).
