            <P><B>SOSIPATER</B><P> so-sip'-a-ter (Sosipatros):
<P> Sosipater unites with Lucius and Jason in sending greetings to the Roman Christians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:21">Romans 16:21</A>). He is a "kinsman" of Paul, by which Paul means a Jew (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:11,21">16:11,21</A>). It is the same name as SOPATER (which see). "Sopater of Berea" was one of the companions of Paul on his journey from Philippi after his 3rd missionary journey (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</A>). These two are probably the same person, Paul having with him in Corinth, at the time of writing to the Roman Christians, the two Macedonians, Sopater of Berea and Jason of Thessalonica. The name Sosipater is found on a list of politarchs of Thessalonica.
