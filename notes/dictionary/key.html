            <P><B>KEY</B><P> ke (maphteach, an "opener"; compare kleis, "that which shuts"):
<P> Made of wood, usually with nails which fitted into corresponding holes in the lock, or rather bolt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:25">Judges 3:25</A>). Same is rendered "opening" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:27">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:27</A>.
<P> See HOUSE.
<P> Figurative:
<P> Used figuratively for power, since the key was sometimes worn on the shoulder as a sign of official authority (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+22-22">Isaiah 22-22</A>). In the New Testament it is used several times thus figuratively: of Peter: "the keys of the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</A>); of Christ, in Revelation, having the "keys of death and of Hades" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</A>), also having "the key of David" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</A>). An angel was given "the key of the pit of the abyss" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+20:1">20:1</A>). our Lord accused the teachers of the law of His day of taking away "the key of knowledge" from men, that is, locking the doors of truth against them (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+11:52">Luke 11:52</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</A>).
