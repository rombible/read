            <P><B>SHEAR-JASHUB</B><P> she-ar-ja'-shub or jash'-ub (she'ar yashubh, "a remnant shall return"; Septuagint ho kataleiphtheis Iasoub):
<P> The son of Isaiah, who accompanied him when he set out to meet Ahaz (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:3">Isaiah 7:3</A>). The name like that of other children of prophets (compare "Immanuel," "Mahershalal-hash-baz," "Lo-ruhamah," etc.) is symbolic of a message which the prophet wishes to emphasize. Thus Isaiah uses the very words she'ar yashubh to express his oft-repeated statement that a remnant of Israel will return to Yahweh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:21">Isaiah 10:21</A>).
