Sulp. Quirinus, A.D. 6, A.U.C. 759), referred to by Gamaliel in his speech before the Sanhedrin. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/5-37.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/5-37.html">Acts 5:37</a> ) According to Josephus, Judas was a Gaulonite of the city of Gamala, probably taking his name of Galilean from his insurrection having had its rise in Galilee. The Gaulonites, as his followers were called, may be regarded as the doctrinal ancestors of the Zealots and Sicarii of later days. </FONT></body></html>
