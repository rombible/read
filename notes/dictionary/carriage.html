            <P><B>CARRIAGE</B><P> kar'-ij (keli, kebhuddah, nesu'ah; episkeuasamenoi; the Revised Version (British and American) "We took up our baggage"; the American Revised Version, margin "made ready"):
<P> One or the other of the above words occurs in six different places and all have been translated in the King James Version by "carriage" in its obsolete meaning (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+18:21">Judges 18:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17:22">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:22</A> (twice); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:28">Isaiah 10:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+46:1">46:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:15">Acts 21:15</A>). In the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version these are translated by the more modern expressions "goods," "baggage," or "the things that you carried." In
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17:20">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:20</A> the King James Version margin "place of the carriage" occurs as the equivalent of "trench." The Hebrew ma'galah may mean "the place of wagons" as translated in the Revised Version (British and American), as it is not at all improbable that the encampment was surrounded by the baggage train.
