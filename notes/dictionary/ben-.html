            <P><B>BEN-</B><P> Ben (prefix) (singular ben, "son of"; plural bene, "sons of" = Aramaic bar):
<P> This word is used in the singular or plural to express relationship of almost any kind:
<P> (1) to a person; as such it is found as part of many compound names like Benjamin, Benhur, etc. (compare Bar);
<P> (2) to a clan; in this connection it is found in the plural only:
<P> "children of Israel," "children of Ammon," etc.;
<P> (3) to a town; perhaps as place of birth ("son of Jabesh"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+15:10">2&nbsp;Kings 15:10</A>);
<P> (4) to occupation, state of life, age, character, quality even of things;
<P> (5) peculiarly employed in the sense of "scholar disciple" ("son of prophet"), or in phrases like "son of death," etc.;
<P> (6) in poetry, "sons of flame" for "sparks" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+5:7">Job 5:7</A> margin), etc. The frequent metaphorical use of the word indicates that it was rarely used to express the relation of father to son like the Arabic Ibn. Compare HPN, 64.
