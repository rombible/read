<P> One of the delights of Egypt for which the Israelites in the Wilderness longed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:5">Numbers 11:5</A>); we know from other sources that, though originally a product of Central Asia, garlic was known to the ancient Egyptians. It is the bulb of Allium sativum, Natural Order Liliaceae, and is cultivated all over the Orient. It is eaten cooked in stews; its disagreeable penetrating odor is in evidence in the houses and on the breath of most Orientals. A bulb of garlic, hung over a bed or over the door of a house, is a powerful charm against the evil eye and other malign influences.
