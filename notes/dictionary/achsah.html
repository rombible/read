<P> The daughter of Caleb whom he gave in marriage to his younger kinsman Othniel the son of Kenaz, as a reward for smiting Kiriath-sepher (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:16">Joshua 15:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:12">Judges 1:12</A>). Caleb, the narrative says, established Achsah in the South-country, and in addition, at her asking, gave her certain important springs of water--the "upper basins" and the "nether basins." Professor G. F. Moore identifies these with the groups of springs in Seit ed-Dilbeh (notes on Judges in Polychrome Bible).
