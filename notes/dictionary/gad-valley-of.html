            <P><B>GAD, VALLEY OF</B><P> (nachal ha-gadh; the King James Version River of Gad):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+24:5">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:5</A> we read that Joab and the captains of the host passed over Jordan and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the midst of the valley of Gad.
<P> If we refer to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:25">Joshua 13:25</A>, this might seem to indicate a valley near Rabbath-ammon. According to a generally accepted emendation suggested by Wellhausen, however, we should read, "They began from Aroer, and from the city that is in the middle of the torrent valley, toward Gad."
<P> See AR. The valley is evidently the Arnon.
