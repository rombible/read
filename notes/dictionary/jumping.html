<P> JUNIAS; JUNlA
<P> joo'-ni-as or joo'-ni-a (Iounias, Iounia):
<P> One to whom, with Andronicus, greetings are sent by Paul at the close of his letter to the Romans (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</A>). The name may be masculine, Junias, a contraction of Junianus, or feminine Junia; it is Iounian, the accus. form, that is given. In all probability this is the masc., Junias. Paul defines the two as
<P> (1) "my kinsmen,"
<P> (2) "my fellow-prisoners,"
<P> (3) "who are of note among the apostles," and
<P> (4) "who also have been in Christ before me."
<P> (1) They were Jews. Paul calls the Jews "my brethren," "my kinsmen according to the flesh" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</A>). Because Prisca and Aquila, a Jew and Jewess, are not designated as kinsfolk, Conybeare and Howson suppose "the epithet to denote that the persons mentioned were of the tribe of Benjamin."
<P> (2) They had been companions of Paul in some unrecorded imprisonment. The phrase denotes more than the fact that they, like Paul, had suffered imprisonment for the sake of Christ.
<P> (3) This may mean
<P> (a) that they were well known to the apostolic circle (so Gifford and Weiss), or
<P> (b) distinguished as apostles. The latter is probably correct, "apostle" being used in a wide sense (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:7">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:7</A>).
<P> The prophetic ministry of the early church consisted of apostles, prophets and teachers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+12:28">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</A>), the apostles being missionaries in the modern sense (see Lindsay, Church and Ministry, chapter iii). Some apostles were missionaries sent out by particular churches (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:2,3">Acts 13:2,3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+8:23">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</A>).
<P> (4) They were among the first converts, "early disciples" like Mnason of Cyprus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:16">Acts 21:16</A>).
