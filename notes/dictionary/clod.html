            <P><B>CLOD</B><P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+7:5">Job 7:5</A> (gish, gush, "a mass of earth"), "clods of dust," the crust of his sores, formed by the dry, swollen skin--a symptom of leprosy, though not peculiar to it. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+21:33">Job 21:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:38">38:38</A> (reghebh, "a soft clod," "lump of clay"), "The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him," "The clods cleave fast together." In
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joe+1:17">Joel 1:17</A> (meghraphah, "a furrow," "something thrown off" (by the spade)), "The seeds rot (m "shrivel") under their clods."
<P> Figurative:
<P> "Jacob shall break his clods" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+10:11">Hosea 10:11</A>), i.e. "must harrow for himself," used figuratively of spiritual discipline (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:24">Isaiah 28:24</A> the King James Version).
