            <P><B>LO-AMMI</B><P> lo-am'-i (lo'-`ammi, "not my people"):
<P> The 2nd son and 3rd child of Gomer bath-Diblaim, wife of the prophet Hosea (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+1:9">Hosea 1:9</A>). An earlier child, a daughter, had been named Lo-ruhamah (lo'-ruchamah, "uncompassionated"). The names, like those given by Isaiah to his children, are symbolic, and set forth Hosea's conviction that Israel has, through sin, forfeited Yahweh's compassion, and can no longer claim His protection. Of the bearers of these names nothing further is known; but their symbolism is alluded to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+2:1,23">Hosea 2:1,23</A>. This latter passage is quoted by Paul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:25">Romans 9:25</A>).
<P> See HOSEA; JEZREEL.
