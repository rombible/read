            <P><B>GESHEM</B><P> ge'-shem (geshem, gashmu; Gesam, "rain storm"):
<P> An Arabian, probably chief of an Arabian tribe that had either settled in Southern Palestine during the exile in Babylon, or had been settled in or near Samaria by Sargon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+2:19">Nehemiah 2:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+6:1,2,6">6:1,2,6</A>). He was a confederate of Sanballat and Tobiah, and strenuously opposed the building of the wall under Nehemiah. He with the others mocked at the first efforts to build the wall, and afterward repeatedly sought to entice Nehemiah to the plains of Ono. The name also occurs in the form Gashmu, perhaps an Assyrian form of the same name Geshem.
<P> J. J. Reeve
