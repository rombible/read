            <P><B>ABEL-MEHOLAH</B><P> a'-bel-me-ho'-lah ('abhel meholah, "meadow of dancing"):
<P> The residence of Elisha the prophet (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+19:16">1&nbsp;Kings 19:16</A>). When Gideon and his 300 broke their pitchers in the camp of Midian, the Midianites in their first panic fled down the valley of Jezreel and the Jordan "toward Zererah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+7:22">Judges 7:22</A>). Zererah (Zeredah) is Zarethan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+4:17">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:17</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+7:46">1&nbsp;Kings 7:46</A>), separated from Succoth by the clay ground where Solomon made castings for the temple. The wing of the Midianites whom Gideon pursued crossed the Jordan at Succoth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:4">Judges 8:4</A>). This would indicate that Abel-meholah was thought of as a tract of country with a "border," West of the Jordan, some miles South of Beth-shean, in the territory either of Issachar or West Manasseh.
<P> Abel-meholah is also mentioned in connection with the jurisdiction of Baana, one of Solomon's twelve commissary officers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:12">1&nbsp;Kings 4:12</A>) as below Jezreel, with Beth-shean and Zarethan in the same list. Jerome and Eusebius speak of Abel-meholah as a tract of country and a town in the Jordan valley, about ten Roman miles South of Beth-shean. At just that point the name seems to be perpetuated in that of the Wady Malib, and Abel-meholah is commonly located near where that Wady, or the neighboring Wady Helweh, comes down into the Jordan valley.
<P> Presumably Adriel the Meholathite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+18:19">1&nbsp;Samuel 18:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:8">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:8</A>) was a resident of Abel-meholah.
