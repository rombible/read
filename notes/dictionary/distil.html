<P> Only found twice in the English Bible (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:2">Deuteronomy 32:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+36:27">Job 36:27</A>), in both cases in its original meaning of "to fall in drops," as dew or rain (derived through French from Latin de, "down," stillo, "to drop"). It does not occur in its later technical sense, for the process we call distilllation was not known in ancient times.
