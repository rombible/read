            <P><B>BANK</B><P> bank:
<P> (1) (saphah, "lip," "edge"):
<P> "By the bank of the Jordan" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+2:13">2&nbsp;Kings 2:13</A>); "Upon the bank of the river were very many trees" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:7,12">Ezekiel 47:7,12</A>).
<P> (2) (gadhah, "cuttings"):
<P> Always of banks overflowed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+3:15">Joshua 3:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+4:18">4:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+8:7">Isaiah 8:7</A>), as also
<P> (3) (gidhyah, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:15</A>).
<P> (4) (solelah, "mound," "rampart"):
<P> "Cast up a bank against the city" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+20:15">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:15</A>, the English Revised Version "mount," the American Standard Revised Version "mound"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+19:32">2&nbsp;Kings 19:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+37:33">Isaiah 37:33</A>). "Banks of sweet herbs" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:13">Song of Solomon 5:13</A>); "the marginal rendering is the right one, `towers of perfumes,' i.e. plants with fragrant leaves and flowers trained on trellis-work" (Speaker's Commentary in the place cited.).
<P> (5) (charax, "a stake," "entrenchment"):
<P> "Thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:43">Luke 19:43</A> the King James Version "trench"). It is probably a military term and stands for a "palisade" (so the Revised Version, margin), i.e. probably an embankment of stakes strengthened with branches and earth, with a ditch behind it, used by the besiegers as a protection against arrows or attacking parties (Latin vallum), such, no doubt, as was employed by Titus in the siege of Jerusalem, 70 AD (Josephus, BJ, V, vi, 2).
