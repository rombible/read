<P> After Jephthah defeated the Ammonites, he is said to have smitten them from Aroer "until thou come to Minnith" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+11:33">Judges 11:33</A>). Eusebius, Onomasticon mentions a place called Maanith, 4 Roman miles from Heshbon, on the road to Philadelphia (`Amman), and locates Abelcheramim, which is mentioned with Minnith, 7 miles from Philadelphia, without indicating the direction. Some travelers have spoken of a Menjah, 7 miles East of Heshbon, but of this place Tristram (Land of Moab, 140) could find no trace. The same place appears to be mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:17">Ezekiel 27:17</A> as supplying wheat, which figures in the trade between Judah and Tyre. There are really no reliable data on which to suggest an identification, while there are grave reasons to suspect the integrity of the text.
