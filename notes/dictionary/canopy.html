            <P><B>CANOPY</B><P> kan'-o-pi (chuppah, from a root meaning "to enclose" or "cover"):
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+4:5">Isaiah 4:5</A> the King James Version has "defence," the English Revised Version "canopy," the American Standard Revised Version "covering," the last being best, though "canopy" has much in its favor. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+19:5">Psalms 19:5</A> (Hebrew 19:6) chuppah is used of the bridegroom's chamber and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joe+2:16">Joel 2:16</A> of the bride's. Among the Hebrews the chuppah was originally the chamber in which the bride awaited the groom for the marital union. In Judith 10:21; 13:9,15; 16:19 the word canopy occurs as the English equivalent of the Greek konopeion, which was primarily a mosquito-net and then a canopy over a bed, whether for useful or for decorative purposes.
