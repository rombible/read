            <P><B>ELIMELECH</B><P> e-lim'-e-lek ('elimelekh, "my God is king"; Abeimelech, Alimelek):
<P> Elimelech was a member of the tribe of Judah, a native of Bethlehem Judah, a man of wealth and probably head of a family or clan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+1:2,3">Ruth 1:2,3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+2:1,3">2:1,3</A>). He lived during the period of the Judges, had a hereditary possession near Bethlehem, and is chiefly known as the husband of Naomi, the mother-in-law of Ru and ancestress of David the king. Because of a severe famine in Judea, he emigrated to the land of Moab with his wife and his sons, Mahlon and Chilion. Not long afterward he died, and his two sons married Moabite women, Ru and Orpah. Ten years in all were spent in Moab, when the two sons died, and the three widows were left. Soon afterward Naomi decided to return to Judah, and the sequel is told in the Book of Ruth.
