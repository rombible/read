            <P><B>GREECE, SONS OF</B><P> "I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+9:13">Zechariah 9:13</A>). The passage doubtless refers to the captive Hebrews who are held by the Greeks. The exhortation is to insurrection against the Greeks. Although bearing a striking similarity to the passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joe+3:6">Joel 3:6</A>, there is evidently no connection between the two. In the first, there was conflict between the nations; in the second, simply a reflection upon Tyre and Sidon for having sold into Greece certain Jewish captives. From a Jewish standpoint the Maccabean wars were really between Jews and Greeks.
