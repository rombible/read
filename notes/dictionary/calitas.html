            <P><B>CALITAS</B><P> kal'-i-tas (Kalitas, or Kaleitais):
<P> One of the Levites who put away their foreign wives at the request of Esdras (Ezra), 1 Esdras 9:23, "Colius, who was called Calitas." It is the Greek form of Hebrew Kelita (compare parallel passage, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:23">Ezra 10:23</A>, elaiah, the same is "Kelita"). He is also named with those who explained the law when read to the people by Esdras (1 Esdras 9:48; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:7">Nehemiah 8:7</A>). It is not certain whether he is to be identified with the Kelita of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:10">Nehemiah 10:10</A> (one of the Levites who signed the covenant made by Nehemiah). The word probably means "dwarf."
