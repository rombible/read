            <P><B>BUNNI</B><P> bun'-i (bunni, buni, bunni; compare \BANI\):
<P> (1) A Levite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+9:4">Nehemiah 9:4</A>). The repetition of Bani's name in this passage is probably a scribal error. The Syriac version for the second "Bani" reads "Binnui"; but as, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:9">Nehemiah 10:9</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:8">Nehemiah 12:8</A>, Binnui's name comes, as here, between those of Jeshua and Kadmiel, we should substitute Binnui here for the first Bani. The Septuagint renders all three names as if the Hebrew in each case had been bene, "sons of," reducing the proper names in the verse to five. The names probably stand for chief Levitical houses rather than individuals.
<P> (2) Another Levite, one of the overseers of the temple, father of Hashabiah, according to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:15">Nehemiah 11:15</A>; but, according to
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:14">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:14</A>, Hashabiah is "of the sons of Merari" The reading in Nehemiah is a corruption of the one in Ch.
