            <P><B>GUR-BAAL</B><P> gur-ba'-al (gur ba`-al):
<P> The residence of certain Arabs against whom God helped Uzziah, king of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+26:7">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:7</A>). Its mention immediately after the Philistines may have suggested the "Gerar" of the Targum. Association with the Meunim points to the East. It may be taken as certain that Jebel Neby Harun, near Petra, has always been crowned by a sanctuary. This may have been "the dwelling place of Baal"; or, accepting Kittel's emendation (Tur ba`al), "the rock" or "mountain of Baal." The Arabs probably dwelt in the region before the days of Petra (EB, under the word)
