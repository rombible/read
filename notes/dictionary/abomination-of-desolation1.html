It appears most probable that the profanities of the Zealots constituted the abomination, which was the sign of the impending ruin; but most people refer it to the standards or banners of the Roman army. They were abomination because there were idolatrous images upon them. </FONT>[J] indicates this entry was also found in Jack Van Impe's Prophecy Dictionary<br></body></html>
