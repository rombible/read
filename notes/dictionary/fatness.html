            <P><B>FATNESS</B><P> fat'-nes (deshen; piotes):
<P> 1. Literal:
<P> The translation of deshen (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+9:9">Judges 9:9</A>, "But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness?"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+36:16">Job 36:16</A> (of food)), "full of fatness"; of chelebh, "fat," "the best part," "the marrow" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+15:27">Job 15:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+73:7">Psalms 73:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+34:6,7">Isaiah 34:6,7</A>); of mishman, "fathess," "fertility" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+27:28">Genesis 27:28</A>, "the fatness of the earth"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+17:4">Isaiah 17:4</A>, "the fatness of his flesh"); of shemen, "fatness," "oil" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+109:24">Psalms 109:24</A>); of piotes, "fat," "fatness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</A>, "partaker .... of the root of the fatness of the olive tree").
<P> 2. Figurative:
<P> "Fatness" is used figuratively for the richness of God's goodness; as such it is the translation of deshen ("They shall be abundantly satisfied (margin "Hebrew watered") with the fatness of thy house" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+36:8">Psalms 36:8</A>); "Thy paths drop fatness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+65:11">Psalms 65:11</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+55:2">Isaiah 55:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+31:14">Jeremiah 31:14</A>).
<P> "With fatness" is supplied, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:15">Deuteronomy 32:15</A> the King James Version, "covered with fatness"; the Revised Version (British and American) has "become sleek"; for "The yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:27">Isaiah 10:27</A>) the American Standard Revised Version has "by reason of fatness," margin "Hebrew oil"; the English Revised Version as the King James Version, with margin as the American Standard Revised Version; the text is believed to be corrupt; Septuagint has "from your shoulders."
