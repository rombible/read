<P> So the place is said to have been called where Samson threw away the jaw-bone of an ass, with which he had slain 1,000 Philistines (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+15:17">Judges 15:17</A>). The Septuagint seems to have supposed that the name referred to the "heaving" or throwing up of the jaw-bone. The Hebrew, however, corresponds to the form used in other placenames, such as Ramath-mizpeh, and must be read as "Ramah of Lehi." The name Lehi may have been given because of some real or imagined likeness in the place to the shape of a jaw-bone (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+15:9,14,19">Judges 15:9,14,19</A>). It may have been in Wady es-Sarar, not far from Zorah and Timnath; but the available data do not permit of certain identification.
<P> See JAWBONE; LEHI.
