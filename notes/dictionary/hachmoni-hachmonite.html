            <P><B>HACHMONI; HACHMONITE</B><P> hak-mo'-ni, hak'-mo-ni, or probably (chakhmoni, "wise"):
<P> The same word is rendered "Hachmoni," a proper name, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:32">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:32</A> and "a Hachmonite" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:11</A>. The form of the Hebrew word suggests that the latter translation should be adopted in both passages, and that it describes the warrior in one case, and the companion or tutor of David's sons in the other, as a member of a certain family--a Hachmonite of which nothing further is known. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:8">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:8</A>, "Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite," bears the marks of a corrupt text, and should be parallel with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:11</A> so far as the name goes, reading "Jashobeam the Hachmonite." So Klostermann, Driver, Wellhausen, Budde, etc.
