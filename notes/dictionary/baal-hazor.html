            <P><B>BAAL-HAZOR</B><P> ba-al-ha'-zor ba`al chatsor; Bailasor, Bel-la-sor:
<P> A place on the property of Absalom where his sheep-shearers were gathered, beside Ephraim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:23">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:23</A>). The sheep-shearing was evidently the occasion of a festival which was attended by Absalom's brethren. Here he compassed the death of Amnon in revenge for the outrage upon his sister. The place may be identified with Tell `Asur, a mountain which rises 3,318 ft. above the sea, 4 miles Northeast of Bethel. rine Kubbet el Baul may retain the old name.
