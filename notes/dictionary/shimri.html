            <P><B>SHIMRI</B><P> shim'-ri (shimri; various forms in the Septuagint):
<P> There are four Hebrews mentioned in the Bible who bear this name:
<P> (1) A Simeonite, a son of Shemaiah and father of Jedaiah, a chief of his tribe (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:37">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:37</A>).
<P> (2) The father of Jediael, a bodyguard of King David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:45">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:45</A>).
<P> (3) A son of Hosah, a Levite. He was appointed by David to be doorkeeper in the house of the Lord. He was made chief of the tribe, although not the firstborn of his family (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:10">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:10</A>).
<P> (4) One of the sons of Elizaphan, a Levite. He assisted in purifying the temple in the time of Hezekiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:13">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:13</A>).
