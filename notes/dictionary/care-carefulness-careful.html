            <P><B>CARE; CAREFULNESS; CAREFUL</B><P> kar, kar'-fool-ness, kar'-fool:
<P> The English word "care" has such a variety of meanings, and so many Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible are translated by this English expression and its compounds, that it is difficult to organize them into a single brief article. We may do so, however, by remembering that into our word are really woven two strands, one Teutonic and one Latin. The former element implies a measure of trouble or sorrow, as the pain from a blow, a throb, a distress in the mind; the latter, from Latin cura, implies a stretching forward, attention to some person or thing. We can often discern these two senses side by side in the Bible, and sometimes they almost run into one another. This is so especially in the King James Version. We can treat the subject best by keeping separate, as far as possible, these two senses.
<P><P> $ I. In the Sense of Anxiety, Solicitude.$
<P> 1. Substantives:
<P> In the Old Testament several words are translated "care" in this sense. "Thy father hath left off caring for the asses," concern about them literally, "matters of the asses" (dibhre, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+10:2">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:2</A>). "They shall eat bread by weight, and with care" (de'-aghah, "carefulness" the Revised Version (British and American); "fearfulness" the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+4:16">Ezekiel 4:16</A>). The same word is rendered carefulness (the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American); "fearfulness," the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+12:18-19">Ezekiel 12:18-19</A>); and "fear" (King James Version; "carefulness," the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+22:24">Joshua 22:24</A>). Again, "heaviness" (the Kings James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version), but "care" (the Revised Version, margin and the American Revised Version, margin, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+12:25">Proverbs 12:25</A>). Once more, "sorrow" (the King James Version, the Revised with Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version), but "care" (the Revised Version, margin and the American Revised Version, margin, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+49:23">Jeremiah 49:23</A>). There is also the word charadhah "trembling," "fear," "anxiety." It is rendered "trembling" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+27:33">Genesis 27:33</A> the King James Version). But "thou hast been careful for us all this care" ("showed us all this reverence," the Revised Version, margin, the American Revised Version, margin, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+4:13">2&nbsp;Kings 4:13</A>). In the New Testament, "care," in the sense of anxiety, is the meaning given to merimna, the condition of being drawn mentally in different directions, distraction of mind. "Care of the world" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+4:19">Mark 4:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+8:14">Luke 8:14</A>, "cares of this life," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</A>); "care of all the churches" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+11:28">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:28</A>) ("anxiety," the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version); "casting all your care upon him" ("anxiety," the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+5:7">1&nbsp;Peter 5:7</A>). Also in the Apocrypha, "My heart faileth for care" (1 Macc 6:10); "Care bringeth old age before the time" (Sirach 30:24). To these may be added the adjective amerimnos, "I would have you without carefulness" (King James Version; "free from cares," the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+7:32">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:32</A>).
<P> 2. Verbs:
<P> In the Old Testament (da'agh, "to have concern or anxiety for"). "Not be careful in the year of drought" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+17:8">Jeremiah 17:8</A>). (sum lebh, "to set the heart upon"), "If we flee away, they will not care for us" ("set their heart upon us" King James Version, margin, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:3">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:3</A>).
<P> In the New Testament (memrinao), "Thou art careful and troubled" ("anxious" the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+10:41">Luke 10:41</A>). "He that is unmarried careth for things that belong to the Lord" ("is careful for," the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+7:32-34">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:32-34</A>).

"Be careful for nothing" ("in nothing be anxious," the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:6">Philippians 4:6</A>). The Apocrypha has "careful" (Baruch 3:18) and the Revised Version (British and American) has "be not careful overmuch," where a distinction is plainly made between care in the sense of anxiety and of attention, for a person cannot be too attentive, but he may be too anxious (2 Esdras 2:27).
<P> The impersonal verb (melei), though not quite so strong as merimnao, always implies a degree of concern higher than is felt in mere attention. "Carest thou not that we perish?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+4:38">Mark 4:38</A>). "Carest not for anyone" (the King James Version "no man,"

"Dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</A>). "Careth not for the sheep" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:13">John 10:13</A>).

"Gallio cared for none of these things" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:17">Acts 18:17</A>). "Care not for it" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+7:21">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:21</A>). "He careth for you" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+5:7">1&nbsp;Peter 5:7</A>). "Doth God care for oxen?" (better, "Is it for the oxen that God careth?" the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+9:9">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:9</A>).
