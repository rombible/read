            <P><B>HARBONA; HARBONAH</B><P> har-bo'-na (charebhona' charebhonah):
<P> One of the seven eunuchs who served Ahasuerus and to whom was given the command to bring Queen Esther before the king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+1:10">Esther 1:10</A>). It was he who suggested that Haman be hanged upon the self-same gallows that he had erected for Mordecai (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+7:9">Esther 7:9</A>). Jewish tradition has it that Harbona had originally been a confederate of Haman, but, upon noting the failure of the latter's plans, abandoned him. The Persian equivalent of the name means "donkey-driver."
