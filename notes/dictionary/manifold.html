            <P><B>MANIFOLD</B><P> man'-i-fold (rabh; poikilos):
<P> "Manifold," which occurs only a few times, is in the Old Testament the translation of rabh, "many," "abundant" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+9:19,27">Nehemiah 9:19,27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+5:12">Amos 5:12</A>, where it is equivalent to "many"), and of rabhabh, "to multiply," "to increase" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+104:24">Psalms 104:24</A>, "O Yahweh, how manifold are thy works"); poikilos, properly, "many colored," "spotted," "variegated," is translated "manifold": <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+1:6">1&nbsp;Peter 1:6</A> margin, "manifold temptations"; 4:10, "manifold grace," suggests variety, diverseness; polupoikilos has this meaning more intensely (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</A>, "the manifold wisdom of God"). With this may be compared a fine passage in The Wisdom of Solomon 7:22, where it is said that in Wisdom there is "an understanding spirit, holy, one only (the Revised Version (British and American) "alone in kind," margin "Greek: sole-born"), manifold (polumeres)." In like manner, pollaplasion, "manifold more" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+18:30">Luke 18:30</A>), indicates the varied elements of the reward of him who is faithful to Christ. In Ecclesiasticus 51:3, we have "manifold afflictions" (pleion).
