            <P><B>ZAIR</B><P> za'-ir (tsa`ir; Zeior):
<P> When he invaded Edom, we are told that Joram passed over to Zair and all his chariots with him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+8:21">2&nbsp;Kings 8:21</A>). In the parallel passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+21:9">2&nbsp;Chronicles 21:9</A>), "with his captains" (`im sarayw) takes the place of "to Zair" (tsa`irah), probably a copyist's corruption. The place has not been identified. Some have thought that Mt. Seir is intended; others that it means the town of Zoar. Conder suggested ez-Zuweirah, Southeast of the Dead Sea. If Zoar lay in this direction, it is the way by which an invading army might enter Edom.
