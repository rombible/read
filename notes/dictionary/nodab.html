            <P><B>NODAB</B><P> no'-dab (nodhabh; Nadabaioi):
<P> A Hagrite clan which, along with Jetur and Naphish, suffered complete defeat at the hands of the trans-Jordanic Israelites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:19</A>). It has been suggested that Nodab is a corruption of Kedemah or of Nebaioth, names which are associated with Jetur and Naphish in the lists of Ishmael's sons (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:15">Genesis 25:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:31">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:31</A>), but it is difficult to see how even the most careless copyist could so blunder. There is a possible reminiscence of the name in Nudebe, a village in the Chauran.
