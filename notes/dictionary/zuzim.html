            <P><B>ZUZIM</B><P> zu'-zim (zuzim; (ethne ischura, "strong nations." So Jerome in Quaest. Hebr.:
<P> genres fortes): A people conquered by Chedorlaomer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:5">Genesis 14:5</A>). They dwelt in Ham, a region not otherwise known but, from the connection, inferred to be East of the Jordan. It may also be inferred that they were a race of giants. They were perhaps to be identified with the Zamzummim.
