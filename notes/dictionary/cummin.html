            <P><B>CUMMIN</B><P> kum'-in (kammon; kuminon):
<P> The seed of the herb Cuminum cyminum (Natural Order Umbelliferae). It has carminative properties and is used for flavoring various dishes, especially during fasts. In flavor and appearance it resembles caraway, though it is less agreeable to western palates. As an illustration of Yahweh's wisdom it is said (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:25,27">Isaiah 28:25,27</A>) that cummin is scattered in sowing and beaten out with a rod in threshing. These facts are true in Palestine today. The Jews paid tithes of cummin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</A>) (see cut on following page).
