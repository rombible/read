            <P><B>HEALING</B><P> hel'-ing (marpe', te`alah, kehah):
<P> In the Old Testament this word is always used in its figurative sense; marpe', which literally means "a cure," is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+14:19">Jeremiah 14:19</A> twice, and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</A>; te`alah, which literally means "an irrigation canal," here means something applied externally, as a plaster, in which sense it is used metaphorically in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+30:13">Jeremiah 30:13</A>; kehah occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=na+3:19">Nahum 3:19</A> the King James Version and is translated "assuagings" in the Revised Version (British and American).
<P> In the New Testament 5 times the verb is therapeuo; once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</A>) iaomai; in the other passages it is either iama, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+12:9-30">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9-30</A>, or iasis, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+4:22">Acts 4:22</A>, derivatives from this verb
