            <P><B>EGLON (2)</B><P> eg'-lon (`eghlon; Odollam):
<P> A royal Canaanite city whose king joined the league headed by Adonizedek of Jerusalem against the Gibeonites, which suffered overwhelming defeat at the hands of Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10">Joshua 10</A>). Joshua passed from Libnah to Lachish, and from Lachish to Eglon on his way to Hebron (10:31). It was in the Shephelah of Judah (15:39). The name seems to be preserved in that of Khirbet `Ajlan, about 10 miles West of Beit Jibrin. Professor Petrie, however, thinks that the site of Tell Nejileh better suits the requirements. While Khirbet `Ajlan is a comparatively modern site, the city at Tell Nejileh must have been contemporary with that at Tell el-Chesy (Lachish). It lies fully three miles Southeast of Tell el-Chesy.
