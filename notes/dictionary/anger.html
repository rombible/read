            <P><B>ANGER</B><P> an'-ger:
<P> In the Old Testament, the translation of several Hebrew words, especially of 'aph (lit. "nostril," "countenance"), which is used some 45 times of human, 177 times of Divine, anger (OHL). The word occurs rarely in the New Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:31">Ephesians 4:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+14:10">Revelation 14:10</A>), its place being taken by the word "wrath" (see
 <a href="wrath-anger.html" target="_blank">WRATH</a>). As a translation of words denoting God's "anger," the English word is unfortunate so far as it may seem to imply selfish, malicious or vindictive personal feeling. The anger of God is the response of His holiness to outbreaking sin. Particularly when it culminates in action is it rightly called Has "wrath." The Old Testament doctrine of God's anger is contained in many passages in the Pentateuch, Psalms and the Prophets. In Proverbs men are dissuaded from anger (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+15:1">Proverbs 15:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+27:4">27:4</A>), and the "slow to anger" is commended (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+15:18">Proverbs 15:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+16:32">16:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+19:11">19:11</A>). Christians axe enjoined to put away the feeling of self-regarding, vindictive anger (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:31">Ephesians 4:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</A>), and to cherish no desire of personal revenge (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:26">Ephesians 4:26</A>).
