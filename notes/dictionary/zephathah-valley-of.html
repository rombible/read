            <P><B>ZEPHATHAH, VALLEY OF</B><P> zef'-a-tha (ge'tsephathah; Septuagint kata borran, reading tsephoah, instead of tsephathah):
<P> This is the place where Asa met and defeated the Ethiopians under Zerah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+14:10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 14:10</A>). It is said to be at Mareshah. No name resembling this has been recovered there. Possibly, therefore, the Septuagint rendering is right, "in the ravine to the North of Mareshah." In that case the battle may have been fought in Wady el-`Afranj.
