            <P><B>INORDINATE</B><P> in-or'-di-nat ("ill-regulated," hence, "immoderate," "excessive"; Latin in, "not," ordinatus, "set in order"):
<P> Only twice in the King James Version. In each case there is no corresponding adjective in the original, but the word was inserted by the translators as being implied in the noun. It disappears in Revised Version: <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+23:11">Ezekiel 23:11</A>, "in her inordinate love" (the Revised Version (British and American) "in her doting"); aghabhah, "lust"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</A> "inordinate affection" (the Revised Version (British and American) "passion"); pathos, a word which in classical Greek may have either a good or a bad sense (any affection or emotion of the mind), but in the New Testament is used only in a bad sense (passion).
