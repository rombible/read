<P> Some spot between Socoh and Azekah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17:1" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:1</A>) where the Philistines were encamped; called in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:13">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:13</A>, "Pas- dammin." Ephes" end of" or "boundary" and the whole word may mean the "boundary of blood." The deep red color of the newly plowed earth in this situation is noticeable and may have given origin to the idea of "blood" (compare <a href="adummim.html">ADUMMIM</a>). Cheyne suggests that from 'adhummin, to dammim, is an easy step, and that the former, meaning "red brown earth," may have been the original. No other satisfactory locality has been found to explain the name or fix the site.
