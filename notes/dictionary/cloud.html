            <P><B>CLOUD</B><P> kloud (`anan, `abh; nephele, nephos):
<P> I. Clouds in Palestine.
<P> In the Bible few references are found of particular clouds or of clouds in connection with the phenomena of the weather conditions. The weather in Palestine is more even and has less variety than that in other lands. It is a long, narrow country with sea on the West and desert on the East. The wind coming from the West is always moist and brings clouds with it. If the temperature over the land is low enough the clouds will be condensed and rain will fall, but if the temperature is high, as in the five months of summer, there can be no rain even though clouds are seen. As a whole the winter is cloudy and the summer clear.
<P> 1. Rain Clouds:
<P> In the autumn rain storms often arise suddenly from the sea, and what seems to be a mere haze, "as small as a man's hand," such as Gehazi saw (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+18:44">1&nbsp;Kings 18:44</A>) over the sea, within a few hours becomes the black storm cloud pouring down torrents of rain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+18:45">1&nbsp;Kings 18:45</A>). Fog is almost unknown and there is very seldom an overcast, gloomy day. The west and southwest winds bring rain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:54">Luke 12:54</A>).
<P> 2. Disagreeable Clouds:
<P> In the months of April, May and September a hot east wind sometimes rises from the desert and brings with it a cloud of dust which fills the air and penetrates everything. In the summer afternoons, especially in the month of August, on the seacoast there is apt to blow up from the South a considerable number of low cirro-stratus clouds which seem to fill the air with dampness, making more oppressive the dead heat of summer. These are doubtless the detested "clouds without water" mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:12">Jude 1:12</A>, and "heat by the shade of a cloud" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+25:5">Isaiah 25:5</A>).
<P> II. Figurative Uses.
<P> 1. Yahweh's Presence and Glory:
<P> The metaphoric and symbolic uses of clouds are many, and furnish some of the most powerful figures of Scripture. In the Old Testament, Yahweh's presence is made manifest and His glory shown forth in a cloud. The cloud is usually spoken of as bright and shining, and it could not be fathomed by man:
<P> "Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+3:44">Lamentations 3:44</A>). Yahweh Himself was present in the cloud (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+19:9">Exodus 19:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+24:16">24:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+34:5">34:5</A>) and His glory filled the places where the cloud was (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+16:10">Exodus 16:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+40:38">40:38</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:34">Numbers 10:34</A>); "The cloud filled the house of Yahweh" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+8:10">1&nbsp;Kings 8:10</A>). In the New Testament we often have "the Son of man coming on" or "with clouds" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:64">26:64</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+13:26">Mark 13:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:62">14:62</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+21:27">Luke 21:27</A>) and received up by clouds (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</A>). The glory of the second coming is indicated in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</A> for "he cometh with the clouds" and "we that are alive .... shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord" and dwell with Him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+4:17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:17</A>).
<P> 2. Pillar of Cloud:
<P> The pillar of cloud was a symbol of God's guidance and presence to the children of Israel in their journeys to the promised land. The Lord appeared in a pillar of cloud and forsook them not (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+9:19">Nehemiah 9:19</A>). They followed the guidance of this cloud (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+40:36">Exodus 40:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+78:14">Psalms 78:14</A>).
<P> 3. Bow in Cloud:
<P> The clouds are spoken of in the Old Testament as the symbol of God's presence and care over His people; and so the "bow in the cloud" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+9:13">Genesis 9:13</A>) is a sign of God's protection.
<P> 4. Clouds Blot Out:
<P> As the black cloud covers the sky and blots out the sun from sight, so Yahweh promises "to blot out the sins" of Israel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+44:22">Isaiah 44:22</A>); Egypt also shall be conquered, "As for her, a cloud shall cover her" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+30:18">Ezekiel 30:18</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+2:1">Lamentations 2:1</A>).
<P> 5. Transitory:
<P> There is usually a wide difference in temperature between day and night in Palestine. The days axe warm and clouds coming from the sea are often completely dissolved in the warm atmosphere over the land. As the temperature falls, the moisture again condenses into dew and mist over the hills and valleys. As the sun rises the "morning cloud" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+6:4">Hosea 6:4</A>) is quickly dispelled and disappears entirely. Job compares the passing of his prosperity to the passing clouds (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+30:15">Job 30:15</A>).
<P> 6. God's Omnipotence and Man's Ignorance:
<P> God "bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+26:8" target="_blank">Job 26:8</A>) and the "clouds are the dust of his feet" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=na+1:3">Nahum 1:3</A>). Yahweh "commands the clouds that they rain no rain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+5:6">Isaiah 5:6</A>), but as for man, "who can number the clouds?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:37">Job 38:37</A>); "Can any understand the spreadings of the clouds?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+36:29">Job 36:29</A>); "Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+37:16">Job 37:16</A>). See <a href="balancings.html">BALANCINGS</a>. "He that regardeth the clouds shall not reap" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+11:4">Ecclesiastes 11:4</A>), for it is God who controls the clouds and man cannot fathom His wisdom. "Thick clouds are a covering to him" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+22:14">Job 22:14</A>).
<P> 7. Visions:
<P> Clouds are the central figure in many visions. Ezekiel beheld "a stormy wind .... out of the north, a great cloud" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</A>), and John saw "a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</A>). See also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+11:12">11:12</A>.
<P> 8. The Terrible and Unpleasant:
<P> The cloud is also the symbol of the terrible and of destruction. The day of Yahweh's reckoning is called the "day of clouds" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+30:3">Ezekiel 30:3</A>) and a day of "clouds and thick darkness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+1:15">Zechariah 1:15</A>). The invader is expected to "come up as clouds" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+4:13">Jeremiah 4:13</A>). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joe+2:2">Joel 2:2</A> foretells the coming of locusts as "a day of clouds and thick darkness" which is both literal and figurative. Misfortune and old age are compared to "the cloudy and dark day" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+34:12">Ezekiel 34:12</A>) and "the clouds returning after rain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+12:2">Ecclesiastes 12:2</A>).
<P> 9. Various Other Figures:
<P> Clouds are used in connection with various other figures. Rapidity of motion, "these that fly as a cloud" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+60:8">Isaiah 60:8</A>). As swaddling clothes of the newborn earth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:9">Job 38:9</A>); indicating great height (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+20:6">Job 20:6</A>) and figurative in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+14:14">Isaiah 14:14</A>, "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds," portraying the self- esteem of Babylon. "A morning without clouds" is the symbol of righteousness and justice (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:4">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:4</A>); partial knowledge and hidden glory (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+16:2">Leviticus 16:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</A>).
