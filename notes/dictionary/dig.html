            <P><B>DIG</B><P> (qur, "to dig", chathar; diorusso, "to dig through"):
<P> "I have digged (dug) and drunk strange waters" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+19:24">2&nbsp;Kings 19:24</A>). In his campaigns on foreign soil, where the enemy had stopped up the watersprings, Sennacherib would at once dig fresh wells for his armies. "They dig through houses" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+24:16">Job 24:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:19,20">Matthew 6:19,20</A> margin). Walls of eastern houses are often made of mud or clay, and frequently have no windows; and as the threshold of a Syrian house is sacred, the thief breaks in through the wall (see Trumbull, The Threshold Covenant).
