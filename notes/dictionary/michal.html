            <P><B>MICHAL</B><P> mi'-kal (mikhal, contracted from mikha'el, "Michael" (which see); Melchol):
<P> Saul's younger daughter (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:49">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:49</A>), who, falling in love with David after his victory over Goliath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+18:20">1&nbsp;Samuel 18:20</A>), was at last, on the payment of double the dowry asked, married to him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+18:27">1&nbsp;Samuel 18:27</A>). Her love was soon put to the test. When Saul in his jealousy sent for David, she was quick to discern her husband's danger, connived at his escape, and not only outwitted and delayed the messengers, but afterward also soothed her father's jealous wrath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+19:11-17">1&nbsp;Samuel 19:11-17</A>). When David was outlawed and exiled, she was married to Palti or Paltiel, the son of Laish of Gallim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25:44">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:44</A>), but was, despite Palti's sorrowful protest, forcibly restored to David on his return as king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+3:14-16">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:14-16</A>). The next scene in which she figures indicates that her love had cooled and had even turned to disdain, for after David's enthusiastic joy and ecstatic dancing before the newly restored Ark of the Covenant, she received him with bitter and scornful mockery (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:20">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:20</A>), and the record closes with the fact that she remained all her life childless (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:23">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:23</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:8">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:8</A> where Michal is an obvious mistake for Merab). Michal was evidently a woman of unusual strength of mind and decision of character. She manifested her love in an age when it was almost an unheard-of thing for a woman to take the initiative in such a matter. For the sake of the man whom she loved too she braved her father's wrath and risked her own life. Even her later mockery of David affords proof of her courage, and almost suggests the inference that she had resented being treated as a chattel and thrown from one husband to another. The modern reader can scarce withhold from her, if not admiration, at least a slight tribute of sympathy.
