The flesh of swine was forbidden as food by the Levitical law, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/11-7.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/11-7.html">Leviticus 11:7</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/14-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/14-8.html"> 14:8</a> ) the abhorrence which the Jews as a nation had of it may be inferred from ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/65-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/65-4.html">Isaiah 65:4</a> ) and 2 Macc 6:18,19.

Although the Jews did not breed swine during the greater period of their existence as a nation there can be little doubt that the heathen nations of Palestine used the flesh as food.
