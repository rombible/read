            <P><B>PRESS</B><P> pres:
<P> As a verb is used in the Revised Version (British and American) as a translation of no less than 13 Greek and Hebrew words (rather more in the King James Version). All the Revised Version (British and American) uses are modern. In the King James Version may be noted The Wisdom of Solomon 17:11, "pressed with conscience" (the Revised Version (British and American) "pressed hard by"); 2 Macc 14:9, "pressed on every side" (the Revised Version (British and American) "surrounded by foes"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</A>, "pressed in the spirit" (the Revised Version (British and American) "constrained by"). As a noun, the King James Version uses "press" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+2:4">Mark 2:4</A> for ochlos, "crowd" (so the Revised Version (British and American)). For wine press see VINE; WINE.
