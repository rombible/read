            <P><B>SWAN</B><P> swon (tinshemeth, "chameleon," "tree-toad," "water-hen," "owl"; kuknos; Latin cygnus; Anglo-Saxon:
<P> swan and swon): Mentioned only in old versions and the Revised Version margin in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:18">Leviticus 11:18</A>: "the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle," and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:16">Deuteronomy 14:16</A> Septuagint porphurion = "water-hen"; Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) ibis). In the Revised Version (British and American) this is rightly changed to "the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture." A bird of the duck family wrongly placed among the abominations in old versions of the Bible, now changed to horned owl.
<P> White and gray swans spend their winter migratory season on the waters of the Holy Land. They are among the most ancient birds of history; always have been used for food; when young and tender, of fine flesh and delicious flavor; so there is no possibility that they were ever rightfully placed among the birds unsuitable for food. Their feeding habits are aquatic, their food in no way objectionable.
