 ('abh, the Hebrew and Aramaic word for "father"):
<P> It is a very common word in the Old Testament; this article notes only certain uses of it. It is used both in the singular and in the plural to denote a grandfather or more remote ancestors (e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+35:16,15">Jeremiah 35:16,15</A>). The father of a people or tribe is its founder, not, as is frequently assumed, its progenitor. In this sense Abraham is father to the Israelites (see, for example,
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+17:11-14,27" target="_blank">Genesis 17:11-14,27</A>), Isaac and Jacob and the heads of families being fathers in the same modified sense. The cases of Ishmael, Moab, etc., are similar. The traditional originator of a craft is the father of those who practice the craft (e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+4:20,21,22">Genesis 4:20,21,22</A>). Sennacherib uses the term "my fathers" of his predecessors on the throne of Assyria, though these were not his ancestors (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+19:12">2?Kings 19:12</A>). The term is used to express worth and affection irrespective of blood relation (e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+13:14">2?Kings 13:14</A>). A ruler or leader is spoken of as a father. God is father. A frequent use of the word is that in the composition of proper names, e.g. Abinadab, "my father is noble." See <a href="moabite-stone.html">ABI</a>.
<P> The Aramaic word in its definite form is used three times in the New Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+4:6" target="_blank">Mark 4:6</A>), the phrase being in each case "Abba Father," addressed to God. In this phrase the word "Father" is added, apparently, not as a mere translation, nor to indicate that Abba is thought of as a proper name of Deity, but as a term of pleading and of endearment. See also <a href="abba.html">ABBA</a>.
