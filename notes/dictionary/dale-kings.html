            <P><B>DALE, KING'S</B><P> (dal, `emeq hamelekh) :
<P> (1) "Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:18" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:18</A>). According to Josephus (Ant., VII, x, 3) this was a marble pillar, which he calls "Absalom's hand" and it was two furlongs from Jerusalem. Warren suggests that this dale was identical with the <a href="kings-garden.html">KING'S GARDEN</a> (which see), which he places at the open valley formed at the junction of the Tyropoen with the Kidron (see <a href="rainfall-in-jerusalem-in-inches.html" target="_blank">JERUSALEM</a>). The so-called Absalom's Pillar, which the Jews still pelt with stones in reprobation of Absalom's disobedience, and which a comparatively recent tradition associates with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:18" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:18</A>, is a very much later structure, belonging to the Greco- Roman period, but showing Egyptian influence.
<P> (2) King's Vale (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:17" target="_blank">Genesis 14:17</A>; the King James Version dale). See <a href="kings-vale.html">KING'S VALE</a>; <a href="elah-vale-of.html" target="_blank">VALE</a>.
