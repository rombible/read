            <P><B>HEWER</B><P> hu'-er (choTebh):
<P> Applies especially to a wood-worker or wood-gatherer (compare Arabic chattab, "a woodman") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+9:21,23,17">Joshua 9:21,23,17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+2:10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 2:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+46:22">Jeremiah 46:22</A>). Gathering wood, like drawing water, was a menial task. Special servants were assigned to the work (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+29:11">Deuteronomy 29:11</A>). Joshua set the Gibeonites to hewing wood and drawing water as a punishment for their trickery, whereas were it not for the oath which the Israelites had sworn, the Gibeonites would probably have been killed.
<P> See DRAWER OF WATER.
<P> chatsbh, from the root "to cut" or "to carve," applies to hewers of stone in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+5:15">1&nbsp;Kings 5:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+12:12">2&nbsp;Kings 12:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+22:15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 22:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+2:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 2:18</A>.
