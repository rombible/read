            <P><B>MANEH; MINA</B><P> man'-e, or mi'-na (maneh; mna, "pound" (English Versions of the Bible)):
<P> A weight containing 50 shekels, according to Hebrew usage, but which varied according to the standard adopted. Estimated on the Phoenician, or commercial, standard, it was equal to 11,200 grains, or about 2 lbs. troy, or about 1,6 lbs. avoirdupois. This is probably the weight intended in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:17">1&nbsp;Kings 10:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:69">Ezra 2:69</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:71">Nehemiah 7:71</A> f (see WEIGHTS AND MEASURES). When used in a monetary sense, the maneh of silver was worth about 6 pounds 17 shillings, or  (in 1915); the gold maneh was equal to about 102 pounds 10 shillings, or  (in 1915).
