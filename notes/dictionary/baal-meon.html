            <P><B>BAAL-MEON</B><P> ba'-al-me'-on ba`al me`on; Beelmeon:
<P> A town built by the children of Reuben along with Nebo, "their names being changed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:38">Numbers 32:38</A>), identical with Beon of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:3">Numbers 32:3</A>. As Beth-baal-meon it was given by Moses to the tribe of Reuben (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:17">Joshua 13:17</A>). Mesha names it as fortified by him (MS, L. 9). It appears in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:23">Jeremiah 48:23</A> as Beth-meon, one of the cities of Moab. Eusebius, Onomasticon speaks of it as a large village near the hot springs, i.e. Callirrhoe, in Wady Zerka Ma`in, 9 miles from Heshbon. This points to the ruined site of Ma`in, about 4 miles Southwest of Madeba. The ruins now visible however are not older than Roman times.
