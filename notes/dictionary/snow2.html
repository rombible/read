( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/147-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/147-16.html">Psalms 147:16</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/148-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/148-8.html">148:8</a> ) The snow lies deep in the ravines of the highest ridge of Lebanon until the summer is far advanced and indeed never wholly disappears; the summit of Hermon also perpetually glistens with frozen snow. From these sources probably the Jews obtained their supplies of ice for the purpose of cooling their beverages in summer. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/25-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/25-13.html">Proverbs 25:13</a> ) The liability to snow must of course vary considerably in a country of such varying altitude as Palestine. At Jerusalem snow often falls to the depth of a foot or more in january or February, but it seldom lies. At Nazareth it falls more frequently and deeply,a nd it has been observed to fall even in the maritime plain of Joppa and about Carmel. </FONT></body></html>
