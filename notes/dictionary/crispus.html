            <P><B>CRISPUS</B><P> kris'-pus (Krispos, "curled"):
<P> One of the small number baptized by Paul among the Corinthian Christians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+1:14">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:14</A>). He had been ruler of the Jewish synagogue, but he "believed in the Lord with all his house"; and, following Paul, withdrew from the synagogue (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:7,8">Acts 18:7,8</A>). He seems to have been succeeded by Sosthenes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:17">Acts 18:17</A>). According to tradition he became bishop of Aegina.
