            <P><B>GOMORRAH</B><P> go-mor'-a (`amorah; Septuagint and New Testament Gomorra, or Gomorra; Arabic Ghamara, "to overwhelm with water"):
<P> One of the CITIES OF THE PLAIN (which see) destroyed by fire from heaven in the time of Abraham and Lot (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+19:23-29" target="_blank">Genesis 19:23-29</A>). It was located probably in the plain South of the Dead Sea, now covered with water. See <a href="arabah.html">ARABAH</a>; <a href="cities-of-the-plain-ciccar.html" target="_blank">CITIES OF THE PLAIN</a>; <a href="dead-sea-the.html" target="_blank">DEAD SEA</a>. De Saulcy, however, with others who place the Cities of the Plain at the North end of the Dead Sea, fixes upon Khumran (or Gumran), marked on the Survey Map of Palestine North of Ras Feshkeh, where there are ruins about a mile from the Dead Sea. But there is nothing to support this view except the faint resemblance of the name and the inconclusive arguments placing the Cities of the Plain at that end of the sea.
