            <P><B>BROTHERHOOD</B><P> bruth'-er-hood:
<P> The rare occurrence of the term (only <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+11:14">Zechariah 11:14</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:17">1&nbsp;Peter 2:17</A>) in contrast with the abundant use of "brother," "brethren," seems to indicate that the sense of the vital relation naturally called for the most concrete expression: "the brethren." But in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:17">1&nbsp;Peter 2:17</A> the abstract is used for the concrete. In the Old Testament the brotherhood of all Israelites was emphasized; but in the New Testament the brotherhood in Christ is a relation so much deeper and stronger as to eclipse the other.
<P> See also <a href="brother.html" target="_blank">BROTHER</a>; <a href="brethren.html" target="_blank">BRETHREN</a>.
