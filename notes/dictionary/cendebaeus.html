            <P><B>CENDEBAEUS</B><P> sen-de-be'-us (Kendebaios; the King James Version Cendebeus):
<P> A general of Antiochus VII who was appointed "captain of the seacoast" of Palestine (1 Macc 15:38) after the defeat of Tryphon by Antiochus 138 BC. He fortified Kedron and harassed the Jews in various ways. As Simon Maccabeus was too old to attack Cendebaeus in person he sent his two eldest sons, Judas and John, who defeated him with great loss at Modin (1 Macc 16:1-10).
