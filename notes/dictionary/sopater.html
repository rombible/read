<P> the Revised Version (British and American) the son of Pyrrhus; the King James Version omits. A man of Berea who is mentioned with some Thessalonians and others as accompanying Paul as far as Asia on his return to Jerusalem after his 3rd missionary journey (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</A>). He is probably the same as the "Sosipater" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:21">Romans 16:21</A>.
