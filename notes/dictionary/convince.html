            <P><B>CONVINCE</B><P> kon-vins' (elegcho):
<P> Another form etymologically of "convict," means to bring to a decision concerning the truth or the falsehood of a proposition (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+32:12">Job 32:12</A>). As usually applied to what is of a more individual and private character, and having reference to what is either good or bad, or what is in itself without moral quality, it has given way in the Revised Version (British and American) to either "convict," "reprove" or "confute."
