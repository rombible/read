            <P><B>BETH-ZACHARIAS</B><P> beth-zak-a-ri'-as (Baith-zacharia):
<P> Here Judas Maccabeus failed in battle with Antiochus Eupator, and his brother Eleazar fell in conflict with an elephant (1 Macc 6:32; the King James Version "Bathzacharias"). It was a position of great strength, crowning a promontory which juts out between two deep valleys. It still bears the ancient name with little change, Beit Zakaria. It lies about 4 miles Southwest of Bethlehem (BR, III, 283; Ant, XII, ix, 4).
