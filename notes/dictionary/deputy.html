<P> This is the correct rendering of nitsabh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+22:47" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Kings 22:47</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+8:9">Esther 8:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+9:3">9:3</A> the term improperly represents caghan, in the King James Version, and is corrected to "governor" in the Revised Version (British and American). In the New Testament "deputy" represents anthupatos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:7,8,12">Acts 13:7,8,12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:12">18:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:38">19:38</A>), which the Revised Version (British and American) correctly renders "proconsul" (which see). The Roman proconsuls were officers invested with consular power over a district outside the city, usually for one year. Originally they were retiring consuls, but after Augustus the title was given to governors of senatorial provinces, whether they had held the office of consul or not. The proconsul exercised judicial as well as military power in his province, and his authority was absolute, except as he might be held accountable at the expiration of his office. See <a href="government.html">GOVERNMENT</a>.
