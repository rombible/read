            <P><B>DIP</B><P> Priests when offering a sin offering were required to dip a finger into the blood of the sacrificed bullock and "to sprinkle of the blood seven times before Yahweh" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+4:6" target="_blank">Leviticus 4:6</A>, et al.). See also the law referring to the cleansing of infected houses (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+14:51">Leviticus 14:51</A>) and the cleansing of a leper (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+14:16">Leviticus 14:16</A>). In all such cases "to dip" is "to moisten," "to besprinkle," "to dip in," the Hebrew Tabhal, or the Greek bapto. See also <a href="jasher-book-of.html">ASHER</a>. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+68:23">Psalms 68:23</A> "dipping" is not translated from the Hebrew, but merely employed for a better understanding of the passage:
<P> "Thou mayest crush them, dipping thy foot in blood" (the King James Version "that thy foot may be dipped in the blood"). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+19:13" target="_blank">Revelation 19:13</A> is a very doubtful passage. the King James Version reads: "a vesture dipped in blood" (from bapto, "to dip"); the Revised Version (British and American) following another reading (either rhaino, or rhantizo, both "to sprinkle"), translates "a garment sprinkled with blood." the Revised Version, margin gives "dipped in."
