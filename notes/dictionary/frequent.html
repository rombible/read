<P> "Frequent," adjective (from Latin frequens, frequentis, "crowded") occurs only once in the text of the King James Version, as the translation of perissoteros, adverb in comparative degree of perissos, "abundantly," hence, "more abundantly" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+1:12">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:12</A>); in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+11:23">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:23</A>, "in prisons more frequent," the Revised Version (British and American) "more abundantly"; and once in the margin of the King James Version (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+27:6">Proverbs 27:6</A>) as translation of `athar, "to be abundant," the Revised Version (British and American) in text, "profuse."
<P> American Revised Version has "frequent" for "open" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+3:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 3:1</A>, "The word of Yahweh was precious (margin, rare) in those days; there was no frequent vision," margin "(Hebrew) widely spread" (the word is parac, "to break forth," "to scatter," etc.). the English Revised Version retains "open," with "frequent, Hebrew widely spread" in the margin. "Frequent" (the verb) does not occur.
