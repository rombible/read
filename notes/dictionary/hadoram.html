            <P><B>HADORAM</B><P> ha-do'-ram (hadhoram):
<P> (1) Son of Joktan and apparently 6th in descent from Noah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:27">Genesis 10:27</A> parallel <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:21">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:21</A>).
<P> (2) Son of Tou, king of Hamath, sent by his father with presents to King David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+18:10">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:10</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:9,10">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:9,10</A>, written probably incorrectly "Joram," "son of Toi."
<P> (3) Rehoboam's superintendent of the forced labor department (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+10:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 10:18</A>), called Adoram <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+12:18">1&nbsp;Kings 12:18</A>, a contraction of ADONIRAM (which see). He was sent by Rehoboam as messenger to Israel at the time of the revolt of the ten tribes and was stoned to death by them.
