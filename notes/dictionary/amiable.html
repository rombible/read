            <P><B>AMIABLE</B><P> a'-mi-a-b'-l (yedhidh, "beloved"):
<P> Applied to the tabernacle or tent of meeting "How amiable ("lovely" the Revised Version, margin) are thy tabernacles" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+84:1" target="_blank">Psalms 84:1</A>), the plural having reference to the subdivisions and appurtenances of the sanctuary (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+68:35">Psalms 68:35</A>). The adjective is rendered "amiable" in the sense of the French amiable, lovely; but the usage of the Hebrew word requires it to be understood as meaning "dear," "beloved." Compare "so amiable a prospect" (Sir T. Herbert), "They keep their churches so cleanly and amiable" (Howell, 1644). "What made the tabernacle of Moses lovely was not the outside, which was very mean, but what was within" (John Gill). See <a href="tabernacle-a.html">TABERNACLE</a>.
<P> M. O. Evans
