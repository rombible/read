<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+63:15">Isaiah 63:15</A> the King James Version has "the sounding of thy bowels," a painfully literal translation of hamon me'eykha, with the similar phrase, "my bowels shall sound like an harp," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+16:11">Isaiah 16:11</A> (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:36">Jeremiah 48:36</A>). The intestines were considered a seat of emotion, and at times of great excitement were thought (in poetry, at least) to become tense and to give forth a musical sound. The Revised Version (British and American) (following the King James Version in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:36">Jeremiah 48:36</A>) substitutes "heart" for "bowels" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+16:11">Isaiah 16:11</A>, thus obscuring the figure but preserving the sense. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+63:15">Isaiah 63:15</A> the Revised Version (British and American) paraphrases "the yearning of thy heart" (the English Revised Version "bowels"), a needless change from 16:11.
