<P> A seaport of Corinth on the eastern side of the isthmus (see <a href="corinth.html" target="_blank">CORINTH</a>). Here according to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</A>, Paul had his hair shorn before sailing for Syria, since he had a vow. A local church must have been established there by Paul, since Phoebe, the deaconess of Cenchrea, was entrusted with the Epistle to the Romans, and was commended to them in the highest terms by the apostle, who charged them to "assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:1,2">Romans 16:1,2</A>).
