            <P><B>TONGUE</B><P> tung:
<P> Almost invariably for either lashon, or glossa the latter word with the cognates heteroglossos, "of strange tongues" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:21">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:21</A>), glossodes, "talkative," English Versions of the Bible "full of tongue" (Sirach 8:3; 9:18), glossotomeo, "to cut out the tongue" (2 Macc 7:4), diglossos, "double-tongued" (Sirach 5:9; 28:13). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+3:8">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:8</A>, however, "double-tongued" is for dilogos, literally, "two-worded." Where "tongue" in the King James Version translates dialektos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+1:19">Acts 1:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:8">2:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:40">21:40</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+22:2">22:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+26:14">26:14</A>), the Revised Version (British and American) has "language," while for the King James Version "in the Hebrew tongue" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+5:2">John 5:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+16:16">16:16</A> (Hebraisti) the Revised Version (British and American) has simply "in Hebrew." In addition, in the Old Testament and Apocrypha, the King James Version uses "to hold one's tongue" as a translation for various verbs meaning "to be silent"; the Revised Version (British and American) in the Old Testament writes "to hold one's peace" and in the Apocrypha "to be silent," except in Sirach 32:8, where the King James Version is retained (siopao).
<P> The various uses of "tongue" in English are all possible also for lashon and glossa, whether as the physical organ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+11:7">Exodus 11:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:33">Mark 7:33</A>, etc.) or as meaning "language" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:5">Genesis 10:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</A>, etc.) or as describing anything shaped like a tongue (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+11:15">Isaiah 11:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:3">Acts 2:3</A>, etc.). In addition, both words, especially lashon appear in a wider range of meanings than can be taken by "tongue" in modern English. So the tongue appears as the specific organ of speech, where we should prefer "mouth" or "lips" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+4:10">Exodus 4:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+71:24">Psalms 71:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+78:36">78:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+16:1">Proverbs 16:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</A>, etc.), and hence, "tongue" is used figuratively for the words uttered (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+6:30">Job 6:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+139:4">Psalms 139:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1jo+3:18">1&nbsp;John 3:18</A>, etc.). So the tongue can be said to have moral qualities (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+109:2">Psalms 109:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+15:4">Proverbs 15:4</A>, etc.) or to be "glad" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:26">Acts 2:26</A>); to "love with the tongue" (1<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+3:18">John 3:18</A>) is to love in word only, and to be "double-tongued" (Sirach 5:9; 28:13; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+3:8">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:8</A> is to be a liar. A further expansion of this figurative use has produced expressions that sound slightly bizarre in English, although their meaning is clear enough:
<P> e.g., "Who have whet their tongue like a sword" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+64:3">Psalms 64:3</A>); "His tongue is as a devouring fire" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+30:27">Isaiah 30:27</A>); "My tongue is the pen of a ready writer" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+45:1">Psalms 45:1</A>), and, especially, "Their tongue walketh through the earth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+73:9">Psalms 73:9</A>).
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+20:12">Job 20:12</A>, "Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue," the figure is that of an uncultured man rolling a choice morsel around in his mouth so as to extract the utmost flavor. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+10:7">Psalms 10:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+66:17">66:17</A> (Revised Version margin), however "under the tongue" means "in readiness to utter," while in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+4:11">Song of Solomon 4:11</A>, "Honey and milk are under thy tongue," the pleasure of a caress is described. To "divide their tongue" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+55:9">Psalms 55:9</A>) is to visit on offenders the punishment of Babel.
