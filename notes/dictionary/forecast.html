            <P><B>FORECAST</B><P> for-kast'; (vb.) (chashabh):
<P> To forecast is both to plan or scheme beforehand and to consider or see beforehand. It is in the first sense that it is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+11:24,25">Daniel 11:24,25</A> (the King James Version) as the translation of chashabh, "to think," "meditate," "devise," "plot," "He shall forecast his devices (The King James Version, margin "Hebrew think his thoughts") against the strongholds"; "They shall forecast devices against him," the Revised Version (British and American) "devise his devices"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=na+1:9">Nahum 1:9</A>, "What do ye devise against Yahweh?" In the second sense, the word occurs in The Wisdom of Solomon 17:11 the Revised Version (British and American), "Wickedness .... always forecasteth the worst lot" (proeilephen), margin "Most authorities read hath added" (proseilephen).
