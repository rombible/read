            <P><B>HARE</B><P> har ('arnebheth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:6">Leviticus 11:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:7">Deuteronomy 14:7</A>); compare Arabic 'arnab, "hare"):
<P> This animal is mentioned only in the lists of unclean animals in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, Where it occurs along with the camel, the coney and the swine. The camel, the hare and the coney are unclean, `because they chew the cud but part not the hoof,' the swine, "because he parteth the hoof .... but cheweth not the cud." The hare and the coney are not ruminants, but might be supposed to be from their habit of almost continually moving their jaws. Both are freely eaten by the Arabs. Although 'arnebheth occurs only in the two places cited, there is no doubt that it is the hare. Septuagint has dasupous, "rough-footed," which, while not the commonest Greek word (lagos), refers to the remarkable fact that in hares and rabbits the soles of the feet are densely covered with hair. 'Arnab, which is the common Arabic word for "hare," is from the same root as the Hebrew 'arnebheth.

<P> It is evident from the above and from the meanings of dasupous and chorogrullios as given in Liddell and Scott, that the order of Septuagint in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:5,6">Leviticus 11:5,6</A> does not follow the Hebrew, but has apparently assimilated the order of that of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:7,8">Deuteronomy 14:7,8</A>. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+104:18">Psalms 104:18</A>, Septuagint has chorogrullios for shaphan; also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:26">Proverbs 30:26</A>.
<P> Since the word "coney," which properly means "rabbit," has been applied to the hyrax, so, in America at least, the word "rabbit" is widely used for various species of hare, e.g. the gray rabbit and the jack-rabbit, both of which are hares. Hares have longer legs and ears and are swifter than rabbits. Their young are hairy and have their eyes open, while rabbits are born naked and blind. Hares are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, and there is one species in South America. Rabbits are apparently native to the Western Mediterranean countries, although they have been distributed by man all over the world.
<P> Lepus syriacus, the common hare of Syria and Palestine, differs somewhat from the European hare. Lepus judeae is cited by Tristram from Northeastern Palestine, and he also notes three other species from the extreme south.
