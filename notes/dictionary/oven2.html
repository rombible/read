( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/7-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/7-4.html">Hosea 7:4</a> ) The latter ia adapted to the nomad state, it consists of a large jar made of clay, about three feet high and widening toward the bottom, with a hole for the extraction of the ashes.
