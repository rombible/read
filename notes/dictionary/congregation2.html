Sometimes it is used in a broad sense as inclusive of foreign settlers, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/12-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/12-19.html">Exodus 12:19</a> ) but more properly as exclusively appropriate to the Hebrew element of the population. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/15-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/15-15.html">Numbers 15:15</a> ) The congregation was governed by the father or head of each family and tribe. The number of these representatives being inconveniently large for ordinary business, a further selection was made by Moses of 70, who formed a species of standing committee. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/11-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/11-16.html">Numbers 11:16</a> ) Occasionally indeed the whole body of people was assembled at the door of the tabernacle, hence usually called the tabernacle of the congregation. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/10-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/10-3.html">Numbers 10:3</a> ) The people were strictly bound by the acts of their representatives, even in cases where they disapproved of them.
