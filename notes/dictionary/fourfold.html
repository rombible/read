            <P><B>FOURFOLD</B><P> for-fold:
<P> Occurs but twice in English Versions:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+12:6">2&nbsp;Samuel 12:6</A>, "He shall restore the lamb fourfold"; and
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:8">Luke 19:8</A> the King James Version, "If I have wrongfully exacted ought .... I restore fourfold." From this statement of Zaccheus we are to understand that fourfold the amount of that which was stolen was the restoration the law required of a thief. This was the extreme penalty the law imposed. In some cases double the amount was to be restored (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:4,7">Exodus 22:4,7</A>); in others, a fifth of its value was added to the thing restored (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+6:5">Leviticus 6:5</A>); still again, an amount equal to that taken was to be restored (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+12:3">1&nbsp;Samuel 12:3</A>).
