<P> (1) mum, me'um; momos:
<P> This word signifies no particular skin disease, as has been supposed; but is used generally for any and all disfiguring affections of the skin, such as eczema, herpes, scabies, etc., even for scratches and scars, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+24:19,20">Leviticus 24:19,20</A>; and thence for moral defects, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</A>. The existence of a blemish in a person of priestly descent prevented him from the execution of the priestly office; similarly an animal fit for sacrifice was to be without blemish. In the New Testament Christ is presented as the antitype of a pure and ritually acceptable sacrifice "as a lamb without blemish and without spot" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+1:19">1&nbsp;Peter 1:19</A>), and the disciples are admonished to be blameless, "without blemish" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</A>). Rarely the word is used to designate a reprobate person (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:13">2&nbsp;Peter 2:13</A>).
<P> (2) Blemish in the eye, tebhallul (from a root balal, "to overflow"; Arabic balla, balal, "to moisten"), cataract, white spots in the eye (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:20">Leviticus 21:20</A>).
<P> H. L. E. Luering
