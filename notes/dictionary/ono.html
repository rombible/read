            <P><B>ONO</B><P> o'-no ('ono; Codex Vaticanus Onan; Codex Alexandrinus Ono, and other forms):
<P> A town mentioned along with Lod as fortified by certain Benjamites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:12</A>). The Mishna (Arakhin ix.6) says that Joshua fortified it, but there is no such early notice of it in Scripture. It was occupied by Benjamites after the return from exile (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:33">Ezra 2:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:37">Nehemiah 7:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:35">11:35</A>). In one of the villages in the plain of Ono, Sanballat and his friends vainly tried to inveigle Nehemiah into a conference (6:2). It is represented by the modern Kefr `Ana, which lies to the Northwest of Lydda. In 1 Esdras 5:22, the name appears as "Onus."
