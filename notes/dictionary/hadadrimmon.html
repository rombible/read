            <P><B>HADADRIMMON</B><P> ha-dad-rim'-on, had-ad-rim'-on (hadhadh rimmon):
<P> A name which occurs, along with Megiddon, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+12:11">Zechariah 12:11</A>. It was long thought that this was a place in the plain of Megiddo, and that the mourning referred to was that for Josiah, slain in battle with Pharaoh-necoh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:29">2&nbsp;Kings 23:29</A>). This last, however, was certainly at Jerusalem. Jerome (Comm. on Zec) identifies Hadadrimmon with Maximianopolis, a village near Jezreel, probably Legio, the ancient Megiddo. Possibly, however, the form "Hadadrimmon" has arisen through the combination of two divine names; and the weeping may be that for Tammuz (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+8:14">Ezekiel 8:14</A>), with whom the old Semitic deity had become confused in the popular mind.
