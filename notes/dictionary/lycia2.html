The Lycians were incorporated in the Persian empire, and their ships were conspicuous in the great war against the Greeks (Herod. vii. 91, 92). After the death of Alexander the Great, Lycia was included in the Greek Seleucid kingdom, and was a part of the territory which the Romans forced Antiochus to cede. It was not till the reign of Claudius that Lycia became part of the Roman provincial system. At first it was combined with Pamiphylia. Such seems to have been the condition of the district when St. Paul visited the Lycian towns of Patara, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-1.html">Acts 21:1</a> ) and Myra. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/27-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/27-5.html">Acts 27:5</a> ) At a later period of the Roman empire Lyoia was a separate province, with Myra for it capital. </FONT></body></html>
