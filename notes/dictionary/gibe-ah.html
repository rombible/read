Like most words of this kind it gave its name to several towns and places in Palestine, which would doubtless be generally on or near a hill. They are -- <OL><LI>Gibeah, a city in the mountain district of Judah, named with Maon and the southern Carmel, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/15-57.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/15-57.html">Joshua 15:57</a> ) and comp. 1Chr 2:49 etc. <LI>Gibeah of Benjamin first appears in the tragical story of the Levite and his concubine. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-20.html">Judges 19:20</a> ) It was then a "city," with the usual open street or square, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-15.html">Judges 19:15</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-17.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-17.html">Judges 19:17</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/19-20.html">Judges 19:20</a> ) and containing 700 "chosen men," ch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-15.html">Judges 20:15</a> ) probably the same whose skill as slingers is preserved in the next verse. In many particulars Gibeah agrees very closely with <I>Tuleil-el-Ful</I> , a conspicuous eminence just four mlles north of Jerusalem, to the right of the road. We next meet with Glbeah of Benjamin during the Philistine wars of Saul and Jonathan. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/13-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/13-15.html">1 Samuel 13:15</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/13-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/13-16.html">1 Samuel 13:16</a> ) It now bears its full title. As "Gibeah of Benjamin" this place is referred to in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/23-29.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/23-29.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:29</a> ) (comp. 1Chr 11:31 ), and as "Gibeah" it is mentioned by Hosea, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/5-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/5-8.html">Hosea 5:8</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/9-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/9-9.html">9:9</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/10-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/hosea/10-9.html">10:9</a> ) but it does not again appear in the history. It is, however, almost without doubt identical with  <LI>Gibeah of Saul. This is not mentioned as Sauls city till after his anointing, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/10-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/10-26.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:26</a> ) when is said to have gone "home" to Gibeah. In the subsequent narrative the town bears its full name. ch ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/11-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/11-4.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 11:4</a> ) <LI>Gibeah in Kirjath-jearim was no doubt a hill in that city, and the place in which the ark remained from the time of its return by the Philistines till its removal by David. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/6-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/6-3.html">2 Samuel 6:3</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/6-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/6-4.html">2 Samuel 6:4</a> ) comp. 1Sam 7:1,2 <LI>Gibeah in the field, named only in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-31.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-31.html">Judges 20:31</a> ) as the place to which one of the "highways" led from Gibeah of Benjamin. It is probably the same as Geba. The "meadows of Gaba" (Authorized Version Gibeah), ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-33.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-33.html">Judges 20:33</a> ) have no connection with the "field," the Hebrew word being entirely different. </OL></FONT></body></html>
