            <P><B>ARCHITES</B><P> ar'-kits (ha-'arki; the King James Version Archi):
<P> A clan mentioned in connection with the marking of the southern boundary of Joseph (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+16:2" target="_blank">Joshua 16:2</A>). The phrase (gebhul ha-'arki `aTaroth) offers difficulties, and it has been suggested that the order of the last two words be changed to read "the border of Ataroth-of-the-Archites." See <a href="ataroth.html">ATAROTH</a>. G. A. Smith identifies Ataroth with the present Atara on the high road from Jerusalem to Bethel, three and one-half miles South of Bethel and six East of th e upper Beth-horon. Hushai, the "friend" of David, was an Arcbite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+16:16">2&nbsp;Samuel 16:16</A>).
