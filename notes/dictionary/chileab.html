            <P><B>CHILEAB</B><P> kil'-e-ab (kil'abh; Dalouia, "restraint of father"):
<P> A son of David, born to him at Hebron. His mother was Abigail, whom David married after the death of her husband Nabal, the Carmelite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+3:3">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:3</A>). In the corresponding account (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:1">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:1</A>) he is called "Daniel," the meaning of which name ("God is my judge") points to its having been given in order to commemorate God's judgment upon Nabal (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25:39">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:39</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+30:6">Genesis 30:6</A>). Some suppose that he bore both names, but the Septuagint reading here Dalouia (Ch Damniel), and the identity of the last three letters of the Hebrew word "Chileab" with the first three of the following word, seems to indicate that the text of Samuel is corrupt.
