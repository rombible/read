            <P><B>CONVICT; CONVICTION</B><P> kon-vikt', kon-vik'-shun (elegcho and compounds, "to prove guilty"):
<P> Usual translation of English Versions of the Bible, where the King James Version has "convince," as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+8:46">John 8:46</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+2:9">James 2:9</A>; once also replacing the King James Version "reprove" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+16:8">John 16:8</A>), while the Revised Version (British and American) changes the King James Version "convince" into "reprove" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:24">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:24</A>. It always implies the presentation of evidence. It is a decision presumed to be based upon a careful and discriminating consideration of all the proofs offered, and has a legal character, the verdict being rendered either in God's judgment (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</A>), or before men (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+8:46">John 8:46</A>) by an appeal to their consciences in which God's law is written (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</A>). Since such conviction is addressed to the heart of the guilty, as well as concerning him externally, the word "reprove" is sometimes substituted. To "convict .... in respect of righteousness, and of judgment" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+16:8">John 16:8</A>), refers to the conviction of the inadequacy and perversity of the ordinary, natural standards of righteousness and judgment, and the approval of those found in Christ, by the agency of the Holy Spirit, as the great interpreter and applier of the work of Christ.
