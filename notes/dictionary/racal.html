            <P><B>RACAL</B><P> ra'-kal (rakhal, "trader"):
<P> A place in Judah, enumerated among "the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt," to the elders of which he sent a share of his spoils (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:29">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:29</A>). The Septuagint reading "Carmel" has been adopted, by many, because of the similarity of the words in Hebrew (rakal and karmel) and because there was a Carmel in the neighborhood of Hebron (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:55">Joshua 15:55</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+15:12">1&nbsp;Samuel 15:12</A>), which figures in the story of David's adventures when pursued by Saul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25">1&nbsp;Samuel 25</A>) in a manner that makes it improbable that he would overlook the place in his good fortune (the King James Version "Rachal").
