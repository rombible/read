<P> LITERATURE
<P> I. Importance of Studying 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians Together.
<P> Those who hold to the Pauline authorship of the Epistle unite in ascribing it to a time but little subsequent to the writing of the First Letter. It is simply a second prescription for the same case, made after discovering that some certain stubborn symptoms had not yielded to the first treatment. 2Th should be studied in connection with 1 Thessalonians because it is only from an understanding of the First Epistle and the situation that it revealed that one can fully grasp the significance of the Second. And more than that, the solution of the problem as to whether Paul wrote the Second Letter is likewise largely dependent on our knowledge of the First. It would, for instance, be much harder to believe that Paul had written 2 Thessalonians if we did not know that before writing it he had used the tender and tactful methods of treatment which we find in the First Letter. It is as though one should enter a sick rook where the physician is resorting to some rather strong measures with a patient. One is better prepared to judge the wisdom of the treatment if he knows the history of the case, and discovers that gentler methods have already been tried by the physician without success.
<P> II. Authenticity.
<P> 1. Arguments against the Pauline Authorship:
<P> The different treatment of the subject of the second coming of Christ, the different emotional tone, and the different relationships between Paul and the church presupposed in the First and Second Epistles have been among the causes which have led to repeated questionings of the Pauline authorship of 2 Thessalonians. Scholars argue, in the first place, that the doctrine concerning the coming of Christ which we find in the Second Letter is not only differently phrased but is contradictory to that in the First. We get the impression from the First Letter that the Day of the Lord is at hand. It will come as a thief in the night (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+5:2">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:2</A>), and one of the main parts of Christian duty is to expect (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+1:9,10">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:9,10</A>). In the Second Letter, however, he writer urges strongly against any influence that will deceive them into believing that the Day of the Lord is at hand, because it will not be "except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:1-4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:1-4</A>).
<P> Again very plainly also, say the critics, a different relation exists between the writer and the church at Thessalonica. In the First Letter he coaxes; in the Second Letter he commands (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+4:1,2,9-12">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:1,2,9-12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+5:1-11">5:1-11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:1-4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:1-4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+3:6,12-14">3:6,12-14</A>). Moreover, the whole emotional tone of the Second Letter is different from that of the First. The First Epistle is a veritable geyser of joyous, grateful affection and tenderness. The Second Letter, while it also contains expressions of the warmest affection and appreciation, is quite plainly not written under the same pressure of tender emotion. Here, say the critics, is a lower plane of inspiration. Here are Paul's words and phrases and plain imitations of Paul's manner, but here most emphatically is not the flood tide of Paul's inspiration. Moreover, the lurid vision of the battle between the man of sin and the returning Messiah in the Second Letter is different in form and coloring from anything which we find elsewhere in Paul. These, and other considerations have led many to assume that the letter was written by a hand other than that of the Apostle to the Gentiles.
<P> 2. Arguments for the Pauline Authorship:
<P> The Hypothesis, however, that Paul was not the author of the Epistle, while it obviates certain difficulties, raises many more. Into a statement of these difficulties we will not go here, but refer the reader to a brief and scholarly putting of them in Peake's Critical Introduction to the New Testament, 12-16 (New York, Scribners, 1910).
<P> There is accordingly today a manifest tendency among all scholars, including those in the more radical camps, to return to the traditional position concerning the authorship. The following are some of the positive arguments for the authenticity:
<P> As for the opposing views of the coming of Christ in the two Epistles, it is to be noted that precisely the same superficial contradiction occurs in our Lord's own teaching on this same subject (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:6,23,24,25,26">Matthew 24:6,23,24,25,26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:35,40">Luke 12:35,40</A>). Jesus exhorts His disciples to watch, for in such an hour as they think not the Son of man cometh, and yet at the same time and in the same connection warns them that when they see certain signs they should not be troubled, for the end is not yet. Paul, brooding over the subject after writing the First Letter, might easily have come strongly to see the obverse side of the shield. The apostle built his theology upon the tradition which had come from Jesus as interpreted by its practical effects upon his converts, and his mind was quick to counteract any danger due to overemphasis or wrong inferences. He was not nearly as eager for a consistently stated doctrine as he was for a doctrine that made for spiritual life and efficiency. During the fierce persecutions at the beginning of the movement in Thessalonica, the comfort of the thought of the swift coming of Christ was in need of emphasis but as soon as the doctrine was used as an excuse for unhealthful religious excitement the minds of the disciples must be focused on more prosaic and less exciting aspects of reality.
<P> That Paul assumes a commanding and peremptory attitude in the Second Letter which we do not find so plainly asserted in the First is readily admitted. Why should not the First Letter have had its intended effect upon the Thessalonian church as a whole? And if Paul received word that his gracious and tactful message had carried with it the conviction of the dominant elements of the church, but that certain groups had continued to be fanatical and disorderly, we can easily see how, with the main current of the church behind him, he would have dared to use more drastic methods with the offending members.
<P> It is also readily admitted that the Second Letter is not so delightful and heart-warming as the First. It was plainly not written in a mood of such high emotional elevation. But the question may be raised as to whether the coaxing, caressing tone of the First Epistle would have been appropriate in handling the lazy and fanatical elements of the church after it had persisted in disregarding his tender and kindly admonitions. Jesus' stern words to the Pharisees in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23">Matthew 23</A> are not so inspiring as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+14">John 14</A>, but they were the words and the only words that were needed at the time. "Let not your heart be troubled" would not be inspired if delivered to hypocrites. Furthermore, we are not called upon to assume that Paul at all times lived in the same mood of emotional exaltation. Indeed his Epistles abound with assertions that this was not the case (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+1:8">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+3:9">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:9</A>), and it is unreasonable to expect him always to write in the same key. It must be added, however, that the suggestion that the Second Epistle is stern may easily be overdone. If 1 Thessalonians were not before us, it would be the tenderness of Paul's treatment of the church which would most impress us.
<P> Harnack has recently added the weight of his authority to the argument for the Pauline authorship of the letter. He thinks that there were two distinct societies in Thessalonica, the one perhaps meeting in the Jewish quarter and composed chiefly of Jewish Christians, and the other composed of Greeks meeting in some other part of the city. In addition to the probability that this would be true, which arises from the very diverse social classes out of which the church was formed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</A>), and the size of the city, he points to the adjuration in the First Letter (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+5:27">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:27</A>) that this Epistle be read unto all the brethren, as a proof that there was a coterie in the church that met separately and that might easily have been neglected by the rest, just as the Greeks in Jerusalem were neglected in the daily ministration (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</A>). He thinks that the Second Letter was probably directed to the Jewish element of the Church.
<P> It is to be noted also that Professor Moffatt (Introduction to the Literature of the New Testament, 76), who calls in question the authenticity of nearly all of the books of the New Testament that any reputable scholars now attack, finds no sufficient reason to question the Pauline authorship of 2 Thessalonians.
<P> III. The Man of Sin.
<P> 1. Primary Reference:
<P> The question as to whom or what Paul refers to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:1-12">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:1-12</A>, when he speaks of the man of sin, whose revelation is to precede the final manifestation of Christ, has divided scholars during all the Christian centuries. (For a good discussion of the history of the interpretation of this difficult section, see Findlay, "I and II Thessalonians," Cambridge Bible, 170-80.) The reason why each age has had its fresh interpretation identifying the man of sin with the blasphemous powers of evil then most active is the fact that the prophecy has never yet found its complete accomplishment. The man of sin has never been fully revealed, and Christ has never finally destroyed him.
<P> But Paul says that the mystery of iniquity already works (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:7">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:7</A>), and he tells the church that the restraining influence which for the time being held it in check is something that "ye know" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:6">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:6</A>). Plainly, then, the evil power and that which held it in check were things quite familiar both to Paul and to his readers. We must therefore give the prophecy a lst-century reference. The alternative probably lies between making the mystery of iniquity the disposition of the Roman emperor to give himself out as an incarnation of deity and force all men to worship him, a tendency which was then being held in check by Claudius, but which soon broke out under Caligula (see Peake's Introduction above cited); or, on the other hand, making the mystery of iniquity to be some peculiar manifestation of diabolism which was to break out from the persecuting Jewish world, and which was then held in check by the restraining power of the Roman government.
<P> In favor of making a blasphemous Roman emperor the man of sin, may be urged the fact that it was this demand of the emperor for worship which brought matters to a crisis in the Roman world and turned the terrific enginery of the Roman empire against Christianity. And it may be argued that it is hardly likely that the temporary protection which Paul received from the Roman government prevented him from seeing that its spirit was such that it must ultimately be ranged against Christianity. One may note also, in arguing for the Roman reference of the man of sin, the figurative and enigmatic way in which Paul refers to the opposing power, a restraint that would be rendered necessary for reasons of prudence (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+13:14">Mark 13:14</A>, and also the cryptograms used by the author of the Book of Revelation in referring to Rome). Paul has none of this reserve in referring to the persecuting Jewish world who "please not God, and are contrary to all men" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:15">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:15</A>). And in view of the fact that the Jews were in disfavor in the Roman empire, as is proved by then recently issued decree of Claudius commanding all Jews to depart from Rome (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</A>), and by the fact that to proclaim a man a Jew helped at that time to lash a mob into fury against him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+16:20">Acts 16:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:34">19:34</A>), it would seem hardly likely that Paul would expect the subtle and attractive deception that was to delude the World to come from Jerusalem; and particularly would this seem unlikely in view of the fact that Paul seems to be familiar with our Lord's prophecy of the swift destruction of Jerusalem, as is shown by his assertion in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:16</A>, that wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
<P> On the other hand, however, to make the man of sin a person or an influence coming from Judaism is supported by the fact that he is to sit in the temple of God, setting himself forth to be God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:4">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:4</A>), and by the fact that the natural punishment for the rejection of their Messiah was that the Jews should be led to accept a false Messiah. Having opposed Him who came in the Father's name, they were doomed to accept one who came in his own name. Again, and far more important than this, is the fact that during nearly the whole of Paul's life it was the Roman empire that protected him, and the unbelieving Jews that formed the malicious, cunning and powerful opposition to his work and to the well-being and peace of his churches, and he could very well have felt that the final incarnation of evil was to come from the source which had crucified the Christ and which had thus far been chiefly instrumental in opposing the gospel. Moreover, this expectation that a mysterious power of evil should arise out of the Jewish world seems to be in harmony with the rest of the New Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:5,23,24">Matthew 24:5,23,24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+11:3,1,8">Revelation 11:3,1,8</A>). It is the second alternative, therefore, that is, with misgivings, chosen by the present writer.
<P> It may be objected that this cannot be the true Interpretation, as it was not fulfilled, but, on the contrary, it was Rome that became the gospel's most formidable foe. But this type of objection, if accepted as valid, practically puts a stop to all attempts at a historical interpretation of prophecy. It would force us to deny that the prophecies of the Old Testament, which are usually taken as referring to Christ, referred to Him at all, because plainly they were not literally fulfilled in the time and manner that the prophets expected them to be fulfilled. It would almost force us to deny that John the Baptist referred to Christ when he heralded the coming of the one who would burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire, because as the Gospels tell us Jesus did not fulfill this prophecy in the way John expected (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+7:19">Luke 7:19</A>).
<P> See MAN OF SIN.
<P> 2. Permanent Value of the Teaching concerning the Man of Sin:
<P> Although Paul's prediction concerning the man of sin was not literally fulfilled, nevertheless his teaching has a permanent significance. It is always true in every battle for good that the Son of man does not come until the falling away comes and the man of sin is revealed. First, there is the fresh tide of enthusiasm and the promise of swift victory for the kingdom of heaven, but soon there is the reaction and the renascence of opposition in new and overwhelming power. The battle is to the death. And then above the smoke of the battle men see the sign of the coming of the Son of man with power and great glory; the conviction floods them that after all what Christ stands for is at the center of the universe and must prevail, and men begin to recognize Christ's principles as though they were natural law. This action and reaction followed by final victory takes place in practically all religious and reforming movements which involve the social reconstruction of society according to the principles of the Kingdom. It is exceedingly important that men should be delivered from shallow optimism. And this Epistle makes its contribution to that good end.
<P> IV. Paul's Exhortation to Quiet Industry.
<P> The exhortation that the brethren should work with quietness and earn their own bread (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+3:12">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:12</A>) is full of interest to those who are studying the psychological development of the early Christians under the influence of the great mental stimulus that came to them from the gospel. Some were so excited by the new dignity that had come to them as members of the Christian society, and by the new hopes that had been inspired in their minds, that they considered themselves above the base necessity of manual labor. This is not an infrequent phenomenon among new converts to Christianity in heathen lands. Paul would have none of it. Fortunately he could point to his own example. He not only labored among them to earn his own livelihood, but he worked until muscles ached and body rebelled (2 These 3:8).
<P> Paul saw that the gospel was to be propagated chiefly by its splendid effects on the lives of all classes of society, and he realized that almost the first duty of the church was to be respected, and so he not only exhorts the individual members to independence, but he lays down the principle that no economic parasite is to be tolerated in the church. "If any man will not work, neither let him eat" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+3:10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:10</A>). This forms an important complement to the teaching of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+5:42">Matthew 5:42</A>):
