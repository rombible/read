            <P><B>KAMON</B><P> ka'-mon (qamon; the King James Version Camon):
<P> The place where Jair was buffed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+10:3-5">Judges 10:3-5</A>). It is possibly represented either by Kamm or Kumeim, ruins which lie about 6 and 7 miles respectively to the South-Southeast of Umm Keis. See further HAVVOTH-JAIR. The ruins of Kamm, about 200 yds. square, crown a small elevation, and point to an important place in the past. There are large rock-hewn cisterns to the South. Among the ruins of Kumein, which are not considerable, a few mud huts are built, occupied today by about 200 souls (Schumacher, Northern 'Ajlun, 137).
