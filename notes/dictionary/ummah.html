            <P><B>UMMAH</B><P> um'-a (`ummah; Archob, Amma):
<P> One of the cities allotted to the tribe of Asher (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:30">Joshua 19:30</A>). By a slight emendation of the text it would read Acco, the name of the place subsequently known as Ptolemais, the modern `Akka. This emendation is generally adopted by scholars, although it is at best a conjecture. No other identification is yet possible.
