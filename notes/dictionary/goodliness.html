            <P><B>GOODLINESS</B><P> good'-li-nes:
<P> This word is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+40:6">Isaiah 40:6</A> as the translation of checedh, commonly translated "mercy," "kindness," etc.: "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness (beauty, charm, comeliness) thereof is as the flower of the field." The rendering is retained by the English Revised Version and the American Standard Revised Version as appropriate in this place; checedh is frequently translated goodness.' In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+40:6">Isaiah 40:6</A> Septuagint has doxa, "glory" (so also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+1:24">1&nbsp;Peter 1:24</A>), which also fitly expresses the idea of the passage.
