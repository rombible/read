 a'-kor (`akhor, "trouble," the idea of the word being that of trouble which is serious and extreme. See <a href="achan.html" target="_blank">ACHAN</a>):
<P> The place where Achan was executed in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+7:24,26">Joshua 7:24,26</A>). In all the five places where it is mentioned it is described as the `emek, the arable valley of Achor. There is no ground in the record for the current idea that it must have been a locality with horrid and dismal physical features. It was on a higher level than the camp of Israel in the Jordan valley, and on a lower level than Debir--a different Debir from that of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:15">Joshua 15:15</A>. In a general way, as indicated by the points mentioned in the border of Judah, it was north of Betharabah, and south of Debir (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+7:24">Joshua 7:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:7">15:7</A>). Many identify it with the Wady Kelt which descends through a deep ravine from the Judean hills and runs between steep banks south of the modern Jericho to Jordan, the stream after rams becoming a foaming torrent. Possibly the name may have been applied to a region of considerable extent. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+65:10">Isaiah 65:10</A> it is a region on the east side of the mountain ridge which is in some sense balanced with Sharon on the west side. By implication the thing depicted seems to be these rich agricultural localities so far recovered from desolation as to be good grounds for cattle and sheep. Hosea recognizes the comforting aspect of the dreadful affair in the valley of Achor; it was a doorway of hope to pardoned Israel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+2:15">Hosea 2:15</A>), and he hopes for like acceptance for the Israel of his own day.
