            <P><B>SECURE; SECURITY</B><P> se-kur', se-ku'-ri-ti:
<P> The word baTach and its derivatives in Hebrew point to security, either real or imaginary. Thus we read of a host that "was secure" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:11">Judges 8:11</A>) and of those "that provoke God (and) are secure" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+12:6">Job 12:6</A>); but also of a security that rests in hope and is safe (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+11:18">Job 11:18</A>). The New Testament words (poieo amerimnous), used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+28:14">Matthew 28:14</A> (the King James Version "secure you"), guarantee the safety of the soldiers, who witnessed against themselves, in the telling of the story of the disappearance of the body of Christ.
<P> Securely is used in the sense of "trustful," "not anticipating danger" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+3:29">Proverbs 3:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+2:8">Micah 2:8</A>; Ecclesiasticus 4:15).
<P> The word (hikanon, translated security (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:9">Acts 17:9</A>), may stand either for a guaranty of good behavior exacted from, or for some form of punishment inflicted on, Jason and his followers by the rulers of Thessalonica.
<P> Henry E. Dosker
