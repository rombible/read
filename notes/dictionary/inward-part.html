            <P><B>INWARD PART</B><P> A symbolic expression in the Old Testament represented by three Hebrew words:
<P> chedher, "chamber," hence, inmost bowels or breast; tuchoth, "the reins"; qerebh, "midst," "middle," hence, heart. Once in the New Testament (esothen, "from within," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+11:39">Luke 11:39</A>). The viscera (heart, liver, kidneys) were supposed by the ancients to be the seat of the mind, feelings, affections: the highest organs of the psyche, "the soul." The term includes the intellect ("wisdom in the inward parts," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:36">Job 38:36</A>); the moral nature ("inward part is very wickedness," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+5:9">Psalms 5:9</A>); the spiritual ("my law in their inward parts," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+31:33">Jeremiah 31:33</A>). Its adverbial equivalent in Biblical use is "inwardly." INWARD MAN (which see) is identical in meaning.
