            <P><B>JERAHMEEL; JERAHMEELITES</B><P> je-ra'-me-el, je-ra'-me-el-its (yerachme'el, "may God have compassion!"):
<P> (1) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:9,25,26,27,33,42">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:9,25,26,27,33,42</A>, he is described as the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah by Tamar his daughter-in-law (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38">Genesis 38</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+27:10">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:10</A> is mentioned the neghebh of the (ha-yerach-me'eli, a collective noun), the Revised Version (British and American) "the South of the Jerahmeelites." The latter is a tribal name in use probably before the proper name, above; their cities are mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:29">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:29</A>. Cheyne has radical views on Jerahmeel. See EB, under the word; also T. Witton Davies in Review of Theology and Philosophy, III, 689-708 (May, 1908); and Cheyne's replies in Hibbert Journal, VII, 132-51 (October, 1908), and Decline and Fall of the Kingdom of Judah.
<P> (2) A Merarite Levite, son of Kish (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+24:29">1&nbsp;Chronicles 24:29</A>).
<P> (3) "The king's son," the Revised Version (British and American) and the King James Version margin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+36:26">Jeremiah 36:26</A>). the Revised Version margin, the King James Version have "son of Hammelech," taking the word ha-melek as a proper name. He was "probably a royal prince, one who had a king among his ancestors but not necessarily son of the ruling king; so 38:6; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+22:26">1&nbsp;Kings 22:26</A> b; especially Zec 1:8 written at a time when the reigning king, Josiah, could not have had a grown-up `son' " (Driver, Jeremiah, 224, note e). Jerahmeel was with two others commanded by Jehoiakim to arrest Jeremiah and Baruch.
