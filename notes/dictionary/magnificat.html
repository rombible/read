<P> The name given to the hymn of Mary in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:46-55">Luke 1:46-55</A>, commencing "My soul doth magnify the Lord." Three old Latin manuscripts substitute the name "Elisabeth" for "Mary" in 1:46, but against this is the authority of all Greek manuscripts and other Latin versions. The hymn, modeled in part on that of Hannah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+2:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:1</A>, is peculiarly suitable to the circumstances of Mary, and plainly could not have been composed after the actual appearance and resurrection of Christ. Its early date is thus manifest.
