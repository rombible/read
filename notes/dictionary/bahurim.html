            <P><B>BAHURIM</B><P> ba-hu'-rim bachurim; (Baoureim usually, but there are variants):
<P> A place in the territory of Benjamin which lay on an old road from Jerusalem to Jericho followed by David in his flight from Absalom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+15:32-16:5">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:32-16:5</A>). It ran over the Mount of Olives and down the slopes to the East. The Talmud identifies it with Ale, math, the modern Almit, about a mile beyond `Anata, going from Jerusalem. If this identification is correct, Wady Farah may be the brook of water (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+17:20">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:20</A>). Here Paltiel was parted from his wife Miehal by Abner (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+3:16">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:16</A>). It was the home of Shimei, who ran along a ridge of the hill cursing and throwing stones at the fugitive king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+16:5">2&nbsp;Samuel 16:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+2:8">1&nbsp;Kings 2:8</A>). In Bahurim Jonathan and Ahimaaz, the native messengers of David, were concealed in a well by a loyal woman (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+17:18">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:18</A>). Azmaveth, one of David's heroes, was a of Bahurim. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:31">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:31</A> we should read, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:33">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:33</A>,
<P> Barahumite. W. Ewing
