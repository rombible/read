<P> This word, rendered in the King James Version "nations," "heathen," "Gentiles," is commonly translated simply "nations" in the Revised Version (British and American). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:1">Genesis 14:1</A> where the King James Version has "Tidal, king of nations," the Revised Version (British and American) retains in the text the Hebrew "Goiim" as a proper name. Some identify with Gutium. The Hebrew word is similarly retained in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:23">Joshua 12:23</A>.
