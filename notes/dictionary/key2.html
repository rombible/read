(Keys were sometimes of bronze or iron, and so large that one was as much as a man could carry. They are used in Scripture as a symbol of authority and power. Giving keys to a person signifies the intrusting of him with an important charge. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/16-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/16-19.html">Matthew 16:19</a> ) In England in modern times certain officers of the government receive, at their induction into office, a golden key. --ED.) </FONT></body></html>
