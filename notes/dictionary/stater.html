<P> Used only once, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:27">Matthew 17:27</A>, where it is rendered by "piece of money" in the King James Version and "shekel" in the Revised Version (British and American). It was originally a standard Greek weight equal to two drachmas, but later it was used to designate the tetradrachma, and this is probably the coin referred to in the above passage.
<P> See MONEY.
