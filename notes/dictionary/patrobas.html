            <P><B>PATROBAS</B><P> pat'-ro-bas (Patrobas):
<P> The name of a member of the Christian community at Rome to whom Paul sent greetings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:14">Romans 16:14</A>). The name is an abbreviated form of "Patrobius." There was a wealthy freedman of Nero of the same name who was put to death by Galba (Tacitus, History i.49; ii.95). The Patrobas of Paul may have been a dependent of his.
