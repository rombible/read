            <P><B>OWL, GREAT</B><P> (yanshuph; Septuagint ibis, or eibis):
<P> A member of the Palestine species of the family Strigidae. The great owl mentioned in the Bible was no doubt their largest specimen of the family, a bird fully 2 ft. in length, full feathered, with unusually large head and long ear tufts. It was a formidable and noble-appearing bird, with resounding voice. It was abundant among the ruins of temples, the tombs of Carmel, the caves of Gennesaret, and among the ruined cities of Southern Judah. It is included in the abomination lists of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:17">Leviticus 11:17</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:16">Deuteronomy 14:16</A>.
<P> See OWL.
