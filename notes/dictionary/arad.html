            <P><B>ARAD</B><P> a'-rad (`aradh; Arad):
<P> (1) A city mentioned four times in the Old Testament. In the King James Version it is twice mistakenly rendered as the name of a king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:1">Numbers 21:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:40">33:40</A>). Three times it is spoken of as in the South Country, one mention using the phrase `the wilderness of Judah which is in the South Country of Arad' (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:16">Judges 1:16</A>), that is, the part of the wilderness of Judah which is in the South Country near Arad. It was situated near the frontier of Judah and Simeon, being grouped with Debir, Hormah, Makkedah, etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:14">Joshua 12:14</A>). Arad and other cities joined in attacking Israel in the fortieth year of the sojourn in the wilderness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:1-3">Numbers 21:1-3</A>), and Israel vowed to "make their cities a devoted thing." In the case of Zephath, one of the cities, this vow was fulfilled after the death of Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:17">Judges 1:17</A>). The Kenite relatives of Moses had their inheritance near Arad (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:16">Judges 1:16</A>). In the form a-ru-da the city is mentioned by Shishak of Egypt as among the places which he conquered in Palestine. The identification of the site with Tel Arad, about 17 miles South of Hebron, seems to be generally accepted.
<P> (2) One of the descendants of Elpaal the son of Shaharaim, mentioned among the descendants of Benjamin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:15</A>).
