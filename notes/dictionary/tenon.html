            <P><B>TENON</B><P> ten'-un (yadh):
<P> This word, occurring in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+26">Exodus 26</A> and 36, is used in the account of the tabernacle to describe the "hand" or yadh by which its 48 boards were kept in place. Each board had two tenons which were mortised into it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+36:22">Exodus 36:22</A> margin). These tenons would be made of harder wood than the acacia, so as better to stand the strain of wind and weather. When in use the tenons were sunk into the "sockets" (which see), and allowed of a speedy reerection of the tabernacle at its every remove.
<P> Sockets are also mentioned as in use for the standards of the tabernacle court (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:10">Exodus 27:10</A>), but there is no mention of tenons. It may be that the base of each standard was let into its socket, without the use of any tenon. This would give it sufficient stability, as the height of each standard was but 5 cubits (7 1/2 ft.) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:18">Exodus 27:18</A>).
<P> For Professor A. R. S. Kennedy's different theory of "tenons," see TABERNACLE, and his own article on the "Tabernacle" in HDB, IV.
