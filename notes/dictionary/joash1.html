After his fathers sister Jehoshabeath, the wife of Jehoiada the high priest, had stolen him from among the kings sons, he was hidden for six years in the chambers of the temple. In the seventh year of his age and of his concealment, a successful revolution, conducted by Jehoiada, placed him on the throne of his ancestors, and freed the country from the tyranny and idolatries of Athaliah. For at least twenty-three years, while Jehoiada lived, his reign was very prosperous; but after the death of Jehoiada, Joash fell into the hands of bad advisers, at whose suggestion he revived the worship of Baal and Ashtaroth. When he was rebuked for this by Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, Joash caused him to be stoned to death in the very court of the Lords house. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/23-35.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/23-35.html">Matthew 23:35</a> ) That very year Hazael king of Syria came up against Jerusalem, and carried off a vast booty as the price of his departure. Joash had scarcely escaped this danger when he fell into another and fatal one. Two of his servants conspired against him and slew him in his bed and in the fortress of Millo. Joashs reign lasted forty years, from 878 to 838 B.C. <LI>Son and successor of Jehoahaz on the throne of Israel from B.C. 840 to 825, and for two full years a contemporary sovereign with the preceding.

On occasion of a friendly visit paid by Joash to Elisha on his death-bed, the prophet promised him deliverance from the Syrian yoke in Aphek, ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1%20Kings+20:26-30" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=1%20Kings+20:26-30&amp;t=niv">1&nbsp;Kings 20:26-30</a> ) He then bade him smite upon the ground, and the king smote thrice and then stayed. The prophet rebuked him for staying, and limited to three his victories over Syria. Accordingly Joash did defeat Ben-hadad three times on the field of battle, and recovered from him the cities which Hazael had taken from Jehoahaz. The other great military event of Joashs reign was the successful war with Amaziah king of Judah. He died in the fifteenth year of Amaziah king of Judah. <LI>The father of Gideon, and a wealthy man among the Abiezrites.
