            <P><B>STOOL</B><P> stool ('obhnayim):
<P> It is not clear what the character and purpose of this stool were Septuagint has no reference to it). It seems to have been a chair of a peculiar sort upon which a woman reclined in parturition (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+1:16">Exodus 1:16</A>). The Hebrew word is in the dual number and primarily means "two stones." The only other place where it occurs is <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+18:3">Jeremiah 18:3</A>, where it is rendered "wheels" Septuagint epi ton lithon, "on the stones"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+4:10">2&nbsp;Kings 4:10</A>, the word translated in the King James Version as "stool" (kicce') is in the Revised Version (British and American) more correctly translated "seat."
<P> See also BIRTH-STOOL; SEAT.
