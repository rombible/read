            <P><B>SPIRITUAL ROCK</B><P> (pneumatike petra):
<P> Having a spiritual significance: supernatural, manifesting the power of the Divine Spirit; allegorically applied to Christ as fulfilling the type in the smitten rock in the desert, from which water miraculously burst forth to nourish the Israelites. A tradition current among the Jews affirms that this rock followed the people in their journeyings and gave forth a living stream for their supply. Paul made this ever-flowing rock a beautiful and accurate symbol of Christ: "The rock was Christ" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+10:4">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:4</A>).
<P> Without the characterizing word "spiritual," this figurative term, with the same significance, is common to the Scriptures; applied
<P> (1) to Yahweh, God:
<P> "Rock of his salvation," "their rock is not as our Rock" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:15,31">Deuteronomy 32:15,31</A>); "Yahweh is my rock" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:2">Psalms 18:2</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+26:4">Isaiah 26:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+32:2">32:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+2:2">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+22:2">2&nbsp;Samuel 22:2</A>);
<P> (2) to the foundation-stone of Christian confession and testimony (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+3:11">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:6-8">1&nbsp;Peter 2:6-8</A>), and thus to Christ Himself;
<P> (3) in Christian hymnology to Jesus crucified and spear-pierced:
<P> "Rock of ages, cleft for me."
