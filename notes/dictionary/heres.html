            <P><B>HERES</B><P> he'-rez, he'-res:
<P> (1) har-cherec, "Mount Heres" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:34">Judges 1:34</A>), a district from which the Amorites were not expelled; it is mentioned along with Aijalon and Shallbim. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:41">Joshua 19:41</A> f we have then two towns in association with Ir-shemesh and many authorities consider that as cherec = shemesh, i.e. the sun, and har, being perhaps a copyist's error for `ir, "city," we have in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:34">Judges 1:34</A> a reference to Beth-shemesh, the modern `Ain Shems. Conder thinks that Batn Harasheh, Northeast of Aijalon, a prominent hill, may be the place referred to. Budde thinks Har-heres may be identified with the Bit-Ninib (Ninib being the fierce morning sun) of the Tell el-Amarna Letters; this place was in the district of Jerusalem.
<P> (2) ma`aleh he-charec, "the ascent of Heres" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:13">Judges 8:13</A>, the King James Version "before the sun was up"), the place from which Gideon returned to Succoth after his defeat of Zebah and Zalmunna. the Revised Version (British and American) is probably a great improvement on the King James Version, but both the text and the topography are uncertain.
<P> (3) `ir ha-cherec, "City of Heres" EVm, "City of Destruction" (cherem) English Versions of the Bible, or "City of the sun" cherec) English Versions, margin. This is the name of one of the "five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of hosts" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+19:18">Isaiah 19:18</A>).
<P> See IR-HA-HERES.
