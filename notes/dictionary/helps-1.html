            <P><B>HELPS (1)</B><P> (antilempseis, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+12:28">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:28</A>):
<P> In classical Greek the word antilempsis means "remuneration," the hold one has on something, then perception, apprehension. But in Biblical Greek it has an altruistic meaning. Thus, it is used in the Septuagint, both in the Old Testament Scriptures and in the Apocrypha (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+22:19">Psalms 22:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+89:19">89:19</A>,<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1es+8:27">1&nbsp;Esdras 8:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ma+15:7">2&nbsp;Maccabees 15:7</A>). Thus, we obtain a clue to its meaning in our text, where it has been usually understood as referring to the deacons, the following word kuberneseis, translated "governments," being explained as referring to the presbyters.
