            <P><B>MALICE, MALIGNITY</B><P> mal'-is, ma-lig'-ni-ti (kakia, poneros, kakoetheia):
<P> "Malice," now used in the sense of deliberate ill-will, by its derivation means badness, or wickedness generally, and was so used in Older English. In the Apocrypha it is the translation of kakia, "evil," "badness" (The Wisdom of Solomon 12:10,20; 16:14; 2 Macc 4:50, the Revised Version (British and American) "wickedness"); in Ecclesiasticus 27:30; 28:7, we have "malice" in the more restricted sense as the translation of menis, "confirmed anger." In the New Testament "malice" and "maliciousness" are the translation of kakia (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:29">Romans 1:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+5:8">1&nbsp;Corinthians 5:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:20">14:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</A>); malicious is the translation of poneros, "evil" (3<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:10">John 1:10</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "wicked"); it also occurs in Additions to Esther 13:4,7, verse 4, "malignant"; The Wisdom of Solomon 1:4, the Revised Version (British and American) that deviseth evil"; 2 Macc 5:23; malignity occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:29">Romans 1:29</A> as the translation of kakoetheia, "evil disposition"; "maliciously," Susanna verses 43,62; 2 Macc 14:11, the Revised Version (British and American) "having ill will."
