            <P><B>ASHARELAH; ASARELAH</B><P> ash-a-re'-la ('asar'elah):
<P> One of the Asaphites appointed by David to the temple service (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25:2">1&nbsp;Chronicles 25:2</A>); in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25:14">1&nbsp;Chronicles 25:14</A> he is called Jesharelah. The latter element in both forms may be ('el) "God," but the meaning of the former part in the first form is doubtful. Thes. compares 'acar, "to bind," "whom God has bound (by a vow)."
