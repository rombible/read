            <P><B>PHARATHON</B><P> far'-a-thon (Pharathon):
<P> One of the strong cities of Judea fortified by Bacchides during the Maccabean war (1 Macc 9:50). Septuagint reads "Thamnatha-pharathon" as the name of one city. Josephus, however (Ant., XIII, i, 3), and Syriac supply the "and" between them. The name represents a Hebrew pir`athon. If it is to be taken strictly as in Judean territory, it cannot be identified with PIRATHON (which see) of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+12:15">Judges 12:15</A>. In that case we should probably seek for it with Dr. G.A. Smith in some fortress covering the top of Wady Far`ah.
