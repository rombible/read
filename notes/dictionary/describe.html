            <P><B>DESCRIBE</B><P> de-skrib':
<P> This verb, now obsolete, in the sense used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:4,6,8,9">Joshua 18:4,6,8,9</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:14">Judges 8:14</A>, is a translation of kathabh, usually rendered "to write" or "inscribe." But in the above passages it has the Old English meaning of dividing into parts or into lots, as for example: "Walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:4">Joshua 18:4</A>); that is, describe in writing the location and size of the several parcels of land thus portioned out. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:14">Judges 8:14</A> "described" should be translated "wrote down a list of." "Describe" occurs twice in the King James Version of the New Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+10:5">10:5</A>), where lego, and grapho, are both rendered "describeth." the Revised Version (British and American) corrects both, and substitutes "pronounceth" in the first and "writeth" in the second passage.
<P> Description = "list" (1 Esdras 5:39).
