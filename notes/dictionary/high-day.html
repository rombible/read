            <P><B>HIGH DAY</B><P> Is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+29:7">Genesis 29:7</A> as a rendering of the Hebrew yom agadhol, literally, "great day." The Hebrew means the day at its height, broad daylight as contrasted with the time for getting the cattle to their sheds for the night (compare French grand jour). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+19:31">John 19:31</A>, "highday" renders megale hemera, literally, "great day," and refers to the Passover Sabbath--and therefore a Sabbath of special sanctity.
