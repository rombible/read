            <P><B>CORRUPTION, MOUNT OF</B><P> (har ha-mashchith; to oros tou Mosoath):
<P> The hill on the right hand of which Solomon built high places for Ashtoreth, Chemosh and Milcom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:13">2&nbsp;Kings 23:13</A>). The mountain referred to is no doubt the Mount of Olives. The high places would, therefore, be on the southern height called in later Christian writings the "Mount of Offence," and now, by the Arabs, Baten el-Hawa. Har ha-mashchith is probably only a perversion of har ha-mishchah, "Mount of Anointing," a later name of the Mount of Olives.
