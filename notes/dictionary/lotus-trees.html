            <P><B>LOTUS TREES</B><P> lo'-tus (tse'elim; the King James Version shady trees):
<P> The trees under which behemoth (the "hippopotams") rests; "He lieth under the lotus-trees," "The lotus-trees cover him with their shade" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+40:21,22">Job 40:21,22</A>). The Arabic equivalent is the dom tree, Zizyphus lotus, a species of jujube tree (Natural Order Rhamneae); it has many spines and small globular fruit a little bigger than a pea. It is common in the Jordan valley. This plant has nothing to do with the Egyptian lotus.
