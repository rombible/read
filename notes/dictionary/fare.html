            <P><B>FARE</B><P> far:
<P> Occurs twice in the Old Testament as the translation of two Hebrew words, shalom, "peace," "prosperity," "completeness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17:18">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:18</A>), found in the section on David's family history omitted by the Septuagint translators, and sakhar, "hire," "reward," Septuagint naulon, "passage-money," "fare" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jon+1:3">Jonah 1:3</A>). In Hebrew both words are substantives; in English the former is a verb meaning "to go," or "get on as to circumstances" (Century Dict.), the latter, a substantive meaning the price which Jonah paid for a sea-voyage to Tarshish.
<P> In Apocrypha the English verb "fare" helps in the translation of three Greek words, kakoo, "fare evil" (the Revised Version (British and American) "fare ill"), Sirach 3:26; elattoo, "fare worse" (the Revised Version (British and American) "suffer loss"), 32:24; rhonnumi, "be strong," "prosper," in 2 pers. (singular) imperat. (err(h)oso) or plural (err(h)osthe) as a farewell salutation, or at the close of a letter, or to describe the welfare (usually physical or social) of a friend (2 Macc 9:20; 11:21,28, etc.). Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+23:30">23:30</A> margin.
<P> In the New Testament the English verb "fare," in addition to its occurrence in the word "farewell" (which see), occurs only once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</A>), where it is said that the rich man "fared sumptuously every day" (the Revised Version, margin "living in mirth and splendor every day").
<P> The Greek is euphrainomai, "be merry," and occurs 14 times in the New Testament, 10 in a good sense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+15:23,14,29,32">Luke 15:23,14,29,32</A>, all referring to the merry-making over the return of the lost son; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:26">Acts 2:26</A>, translation of Hebrew samach, "be glad"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+15:10">Romans 15:10</A>, translation of Hebrew ranah, "to sing"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+2:2">2&nbsp;Corinthians 2:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+4:27">Galatians 4:27</A>, translation of Hebrew ranah, "to sing"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+18:20">18:20</A>); 4 in a bad, or less favorable, sense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+16:19">16:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+7:41">Acts 7:41</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+11:10">Revelation 11:10</A>). The Greek word is variously translated in the New Testament, "be merry," "make merry," "be glad," "rejoice," "make glad," and only once "fare" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</A>). In the last passage it means the general physical and material welfare of the rich man (so the Geneva (1560), the Bishops' and Rhemish Bibles, the Revised Version (British and American) (1881), and not simply partaking of rich food so Vulgate, Wyclif, Coverdale, Cranmer, Geneva (1557) and the King James Version). Luther translates <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</A>, "lebte alle Tage herrlich und in Freuden"; Weizsacker, "genoss sein Leben alle Tage in Glanze"; Ostervald, "se traitoit bien et magnifiquement"; Oltremare, "faisait brillante chere"; Segond, "menait joyeuse et brillante vie"; Weymouth, "enjoyed a splendid banquet every day," all of which virtually agree with the view taken by us as to meaning of "fare." The lampros, "sumptuously," shows that the rich man's manner of living was "brilliant," "magnificent." the Revised Version (British and American) has "fare" for "do" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+15:36">Acts 15:36</A>), "fared" for "did" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:7">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:7</A>), "hath fared" for "was" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+30:29">Genesis 30:29</A>).
