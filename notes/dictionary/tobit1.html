The narrative implies that the land of Tob was not far distant from Gilead; at the same time, from the nature of the case it must have lain out toward the eastern deserts. It is undoubtedly mentioned again in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/10-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/10-6.html">2 Samuel 10:6</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/10-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/10-8.html">2 Samuel 10:8</a> ) as Ishtob, i.e. <I>man of Tob</I> , meaning, according to a common Hebrew idiom, the men of Tob.

No identification of the ancient, district with any modern one has yet been attempted. </FONT></body></html>
