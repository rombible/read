            <P><B>JEHOVAH-SHAMMAH</B><P> je-ho'-va sham'-a (yahweh shammah, "Yahweh is there"):
<P> The name to be given to the new Jerusalem, restored and glorified, as seen in the vision of Eze (48:35 margin; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</A>). Yahweh returns to the temple which He had forsaken, and from that time forward the fact of supreme importance is that He is there, dwelling in the midst of His people.
