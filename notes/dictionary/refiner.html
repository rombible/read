It consisted in the separation of the dress from the pure ore, which was effected by reducing the metal to a fluid state by the application of heat, and by the aid of solvents, such as alkali, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/1-25.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/1-25.html">Isaiah 1:25</a> ) or lead, Jere 6:29 which, amalgamating with the dress, permitted the extraction of the unadulterated metal. The instruments required by the refiner were a crucible of furnace and a bellows or blow-pipe. The workman sat at his work, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/malachi/3-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/malachi/3-3.html">Malachi 3:3</a> ) he was thus better enabled to watch the process, and let the metal run off at the proper moment. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
