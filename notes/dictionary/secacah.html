            <P><B>SECACAH</B><P> se-ka'-ka, sek'-a-ka (cekhakhah; Codex Vaticanus Aichioza; Codex Alexandrinus Sochocha):
<P> One of the six cities "in the wilderness of Judah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:61">Joshua 15:61</A>), that is in the uncultivated lands to the West of the Dead Sea, where a scanty pasturage is still obtained by wandering Bedouin tribes. There are many signs in this district of more settled habitation in ancient times, but the name Secacah is lost. Conder proposed Khirbet edition Diqqeh] (also called Khirbet es Siqqeh), "the ruin of the path," some 2 miles South of Bethany. Though an ancient site, it is too near the inhabited area; the name, too, is uncertain (PEF, III, 111, Sh XVII).
