Although this word appears in the Authorized Version in its original shape only in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/18-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/18-18.html">Joshua 18:18</a> ) yet in the Hebrew text it is of frequent occurrence. It indicates more particularly the deep-sunken valley or trench which forms the most striking among the many striking natural features of Palestine, and which extends with great uniformity of formation from the slopes of Hermon to the Elanitic Gulf (<I>Gulf of Akabah</I> ) of the Red Sea; the most remarkable depression known to exist on the surface of the globe. Through the northern portion of this extraordinary fissure the Jordan rushes through the lakes of Huleh and Gennesaret down its tortuous course to the deep chasm of the Dead Sea. This portion, about 150 miles in length, is known amongst the Arabs by the name of <I>el-Ghor</I> . The southern boundary of the (Ghor is the wall of cliffs which crosses the valley about 10 miles south of the Dead Sea. From their summits, southward to the Gulf of Akabah, the valley changes its name, or, it would be more accurate to say, retains old name of <I>Wady el-Arabah</I> . </FONT></body></html>
