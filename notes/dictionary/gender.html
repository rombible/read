            <P><B>GENDER</B><P> jen'-der (yaladh, `abhar; gennao):
<P> "Gender" is an abbreviation of "engender." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:29">Job 38:29</A> yaladh (common for "to bear," "to bring forth") is translated "gender" (after Wycliff), the Revised Version (British and American) "The hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?" margin "given it birth." In 21:10 we have `abhar (either the Piel of `abhar, "to pass over," etc., or of a separate word meaning "to bear," "to be fruitful"), translated "gendereth," "Their bull gendereth, and faileth not"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+19:19">Leviticus 19:19</A>, rabha', "to lie down with," is used of cattle gendering. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+4:24">Galatians 4:24</A> the King James Version we have "Mount Sinai, which gendereth (gennoa, "to beget") to bondage," the Revised Version (British and American) "bearing children unto bondage" (like Hagar, Abraham's bondwoman), and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+2:23">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:23</A>, which "gender strifes," i.e. beget them.
