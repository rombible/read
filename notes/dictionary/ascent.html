            <P><B>ASCENT</B><P> a-sent':
<P> (1) The rendering in the King James Version twice, the Revised Version (British and American) 14 times correctly, of Hebrew ma`aleh, "ascent," "pass," as a geographical term (the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:4">Numbers 34:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+15:30">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:30</A>; the Revised Version (British and American)
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:10">Joshua 10:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:13">Judges 8:13</A>, etc.).
<P> (2) The rendering in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) of `olah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:5">1&nbsp;Kings 10:5</A>, "his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Yahweh"; but `olah everywhere else means "burnt-offering," and all ancient versions support the Revised Version, margin, "his burnt-offering which he offered" (caused to go up), etc.
<P> (3) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:4">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:4</A> (parallel <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:5">1&nbsp;Kings 10:5</A>) a very slight textual correction (supported by Septuagint) gives us the same words as in 1Ki instead of the difficult `aliyah, "upper chamber," not "ascent" as the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) render it against all usage elsewhere.
<P> (4) In the Revised Version (British and American) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:31,34,37">Ezekiel 40:31,34,37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:37">Nehemiah 12:37</A>, of a flight of steps, stairs.
<P> (5) In the Revised Version (British and American) (Hebrew `aliyah), <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:31,32">Nehemiah 3:31,32</A>, margin "upper chamber" is to be preferred to text "ascent."
