It appears to be derived from <I>adam</I> , "he or it was red or ruddy," like Edom. This was the generic term for the human race. <LI><I>Ish</I> , "man," as distinguished from woman, husband. <LI><I>Geber</I> , "a man," from <I>gabar</I> , "to be strong," generally with reference to his strength. <LI><I>Methim</I> , "men," always masculine. Perhaps it may be derived from the root <I>muth</I> , "he died." </OL></FONT></body></html>
