            <P><B>UZ (1)</B><P> uz (uts 'erets uts; Os, Ox, Ausitis):
<P> Biblical Data:
<P> (1) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:23">Genesis 10:23</A> Uz is the oldest son of Aram and grandson of Shem, while in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:17</A> Uz is the son of Shem. Septuagint inserts a passage which supplies this lacking name. As the tables of the nations in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10">Genesis 10</A> are chiefly geographical and ethnographical, Uz seems to have been the name of a district or nation colonized by or descended from Semites of the Aramean tribe or family.
<P> (2) The son of Nahor by Milcah, and older brother of Buz (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:21">Genesis 2:21</A>). Here the name is doubtless personal and refers to an individual who was head of a clan or tribe kindred to that of Abraham.
<P> (3) A son of Dishan, son of Seir the Horite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:28">Genesis 36:28</A>), and personal name of a Horite or perhaps of mixed Horite and Aramean blood.
<P> (4) The native land and home of Job (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:1">Job 1:1</A>), and so situated as to be in more or less proximity to the tribe of the Temanites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+2:11">Job 2:11</A>), the Shuhites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+2:11">Job 2:11</A>), the Naamathites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+2:11">Job 2:11</A>), the Buzites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+32:2">Job 32:2</A>), and open to the inroads of the Chaldeans (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:17">Job 1:17</A>), and the Sabeans (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:15">Job 1:15</A> the Revised Version (British and American)), as well as exposed to the great Arabian Desert (1:19). See the next article.
<P> (5) A kingdom of some importance somewhere in Southern Syria and not far from Judea, having a number of kings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+25:20">Jeremiah 25:20</A>).
<P> (6) A kingdom, doubtless the same as that of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+25:20">Jeremiah 25:20</A> and inhabited by or in subjection to the Edomites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+4:21">Lamentations 4:21</A>), and hence not far from Edom.
