<P> While occurring but once in the King James Version (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:9">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</A>), is translated in various ways, e.g. "without law" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+9:21">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:21</A>); "unlawful" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:8">2&nbsp;Peter 2:8</A> the King James Version); "lawless" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:9">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</A>); "transgressor" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+15:28">Mark 15:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+22:37">Luke 22:37</A>); "wicked" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:8</A> the King James Version). When Paul claims to be "without law," he has reference to those things in the ceremonial law which might well be passed over, and not to the moral law. Paul was by no means an antinomian. Those are "lawless" who break the law of the Decalogue; hence, those who disobey the commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother," are lawless (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:9">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</A>). The civil law is also the law of God. Those breaking it are lawless, hence, called "transgressors." Those who are unjust in their dealings are also "lawless"; for this reason the hands of Pilate and those who with him unjustly condemned Jesus are called "wicked (unlawful) hands" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</A> the King James Version). The most notable example of lawlessness is the Antichrist, that "wicked (lawless) one" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:8</A>).
