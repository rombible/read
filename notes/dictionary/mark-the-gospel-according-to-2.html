            <P><B>MARK, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO, 2</B><P> VI. Sources and Integrity.
<P> We have seen that, according to the testimony of the Fathers, Peter's preaching and teaching are at least the main source, and that many features of the Gospel support that view. We have seen, also, subtle but weighty reasons for believing that Mark added a little himself. Need we seek further sources, or does inquiry resolve itself into an analysis of Peter's teaching?
<P> B. Weiss believes that Mark used a document now lost containing mainly sayings of Jesus, called Logia (L) in the earlier discussions, but now commonly known as Q (Quelle). In that opinion he has recently been joined by Sanday and Streeter. Harnack, Sir John Hawkins and Wellhausen have sought to reconstruct Q on the basis of the non-Markan matter in Matthew and Luke. Allen extracts it from Matthew alone, thinking that Mark also may have drawn a few sayings from it. Some assign a distinct source for Mark 13. Streeter considers it a document written shortly after the fall of Jerusalem, incorporating a few utterances by Jesus and itself incorporated bodily by Mark. Other sources, oral or written, are postulated by Bacon for smaller portions and grouped under X. He calls the final redactor R--not Mark but a Paulinist of a radical type.
<P> In forming a judgment much depends upon one's conception of the teaching method of Jesus and the apostles. Teaching and preaching are not synonymous terms. Matthew sums up the early ministry in Galilee under "teaching, preaching and healing," and gives us the substance of that teaching as it impressed itself upon him. Mark reports less of it, but speaks of it more frequently than either Matthew or Luke. Jesus evidently gave teaching a very large place, and a large proportion of the time thus spent was devoted to the special instruction of the inner circle of disciples. The range of that instruction was not wide. It was intensive rather than extensive. He held Himself to the vital topic of the kingdom of God. He must have gone over it again and again. He would not hesitate to repeat instructions which even chosen men found it so difficult to understand. Teaching by repetition was common then as it is now in the East. The word "catechize" (katecheo) implies that, and that word is used by Paul of Jewish (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+2:18">Romans 2:18</A>) and by Luke of Christian teaching (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:4">Luke 1:4</A>).
<P> See CATECHIST.
<P> The novelty in His teaching was not in method so much as in content, authority and accompanying miraculous power (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:27">Mark 1:27</A>). Certainly He was far removed from vain repetition. His supreme concern was for the spirit. Just as certainly He was not concerned about a mere reputation for originality or for wealth and variety of resources. He was concerned about teaching them the truth so effectively that they would be prepared by intellectual clearness, as well as spiritual sympathy, to make it known to others. And God by His Providence, so kind to all but so often thwarted by human self-will was free to work His perfect work for Him and make all things work together for the furtherance of His purpose. Thus incidents occur, situations arise and persons of all types appear on the scene, calling forth fresh instruction, furnishing illustration and securing the presentation of truth in fullness with proper balance and emphasis and in right perspective.
<P> Thus before His death the general character of that kingdom, its principles and prospects, were taught. That furnished the warp for the future Gospels. The essence, the substance and general form were the same for all the Twelve; but each from the standpoint of his own individually saw particular aspects and was impressed with special details. No one of them was large enough to grasp it all, for no one was so great as the Master. And it would be strange indeed, though perhaps not so strange as among us, if none of them wrote down any of it. Ramsay, Salmon and Palmer are quit justified in feeling that it may have been put in writing before the death of Jesus. It may well be that Matthew wrote it as it lay in his mind, giving us substantially Harnack's Q. John and James may have done the same and furnished Luke his main special source. But whether it was written down then or not, the main fact to be noted is that it was lodged in their minds, and that the substance was, and the details through mutual conference increasingly became, their common possession. They did not understand it all--His rising from the dead, for example. But the words were lodged in memory, and subsequent events made their meaning clear.
<P> Then follow the great events of His death and resurrection, and for forty days in frequent appearances He taught them the things concerning the kingdom of God and expounded in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself, especially the necessity of His death and resurrection. These furnished the woof of the future Gospels. But even yet they are not equipped for their task. So He promises them His Spirit, a main part of whose work will be to bring to their remembrance all He had said, to lead them into all the truth, and show them things to come. When He has come they will be ready to witness in power.
<P> The apostles' conception of their task is indicated in some measure by Peter when he insisted that an indispensable qualification in a successor to Judas was that he must have been with them from the beginning to the end of Christ's ministry, and so be conversant with His words and deeds. From the day of Pentecost onward they gave themselves preeminently to teaching. The thousands converted on that day continued in the teaching of the apostles. When the trouble broke out between Hebrews and Hellenists, the Seven were appointed because the apostles could not leave the word of God to serve tables. The urgency of this business may have been one reason why they stayed in Jerusalem when persecution scattered so many of the church (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+8:2">Acts 8:2</A>). They were thus in close touch for years, not only through the struggle between Hebrews and Hellenists, but until the admission of the GentileCornelius and his friends by Peter had been solemnly ratified by the church in Jerusalem and possibly until the Council had declared against the contention that circumcision was necessary for salvation. During these years they had every opportunity for mutual conference, and the vital importance of the questions that arose would compel them to avail themselves of such opportunities. Their martyr-like devotion to Jesus would make them quick to challenge anything that might seem a misrepresentation of His teaching. The Ac account of their discussions at great crises proves that conclusively. To their success in training others and the accuracy of the body of catechetical instruction Luke pays fine tribute when he speaks of the "certainty" or undoubted truth of it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:4">Luke 1:4</A>). Thus Jesus' post-resurrection expositions, the experience of the years and the guidance of the Spirit are the source and explanation of the apostolic presentation of the gospel.
<P> Of that company Peter was the recognized leader, and did more than any other to determine the mold into which at least the post-resurrection teachings were cast. Luke tells us of many attempts to record them. He himself in his brief reports of Peter's addresses sketches their broad outlines. Mark, at the request of Roman Christians and with Peter's approval, undertook to give an adequate account. Two special facts influenced the result--one, the character of the people for whom he wrote; the other, the existence (as we may assume) of Matthew's Q. It would be natural for him to supplement rather than duplicate that apostolic summary. Moreover, since Q presented mainly the ethical or law side of Christianity the supplement would naturally present the gospel side of it--and so become its complement--while at the same time this presentation and the needs of the people for whom he specially writes make it necessary to add something from the body of catechetical material, oral or written, not included in Q, as his frequent kai elegen, seems to imply (Buckley, 152). So Mk's is "the beginning of the Gospel." He introduces Jesus in the act of symbolically devoting Himself to that death for our sins and rising again, which constitutes the gospel and then entering upon His ministry by calling upon the people to "repent and believe in the gospel." The book is written from the standpoint of the resurrection, and gives the story of the passion and of the ministry in a perspective thus determined. About the same time it may be, Matthew, writing for Jewish Christians, combines this gospel side of the teaching with his own Q side of it, adding from the common stock or abridging as his purpose might suggest or space might demand. Later Luke does a similar service for Greek Christians (compare Harnack, The Twofold Gospel in the New Testament).
<P> The only serious question about the integrity of the book concerns the last twelve verses, for a discussion of which see under III above. Some have suggested that <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:1-13">Mark 1:1-13</A> is akin to 16:9-20, and may have been added by the same hand. But while vocabulary and connection are main arguments against the genuineness of the latter, in both these respects 1:1-13 is bound up with the main body of the book. Nor is there sufficient reason for denying Mark 13 as a true report of what Jesus said. Wendling's theory of three strata assignable to three different writers--historian, poet, and theologian--is quite overdrawn. Barring the closing verses, there is nothing which can possibly demand anything more than an earlier and a later edition by Mark himself, and the strongest point in favor of that is Luke's omission of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:45-8:26">Mark 6:45-8:26</A>. But Hawkins gives other reasons for that.
<P> VII. Date and Place of Composition.
<P> Ancient testimony is sharply divided. The Paschal Chronicle puts it in 40 AD, and many manuscripts, both uncial and cursive (Harnack, Chronologie, 70, 124) 10 or 12 years after the Ascension. These Swete sets aside as due to the mistaken tradition that Peter began work in Rome in the 2nd year of Claudius (42 AD). Similarly he would set aside the opinion of Chrysostom (which has some manuscripts subscriptions to support it) that it was written in Alexandria, as an error growing out of the statement of Eusebius (Historia Ecclesiastica, II, 16) that Mark went to Egypt and preached there the Gospel he composed. This he does in deference to the strong body of evidence that it was written in Rome about the time of Peter's death. Still there remains a discrepancy between Irenaeus, as commonly understood, and the other Fathers. For, so understood, Irenaeus places it after the death of Peter, whereas Jerome, Epiphanius, Origen and Clement of Alexandria clearly place it within Peter's lifetime. But it does not seem necessary so to understand Irenaeus. It may be that it was composed while Peter was living, but only published after his death. Christopherson (1570 AD) had suggested that and supported it by the conjectural emendation of ekdosin, "surrendering," "imprisonment" for exodon, in Irenaeus. Grabe, Mill and others thought Irenaeus referred, not to Peter's death, but to his departure from Rome on further missionary tours. But if we take exodon in that sense, it is better to understand by it departure from Palestine or Syria, rather than from Rome. Irenaeus' statement that the apostles were now fully furnished for the work of evangelization (Adv. Haer., iii.1) certainly seems to imply that they were now ready to leave Palestine; and his next statement is that Matthew and Mark wrote their respective Gospels. And Eusebius (Historia Ecclesiastica, III, 24) states explicitly that Matthew committed his Gospel to writing "when he was about" to leave Palestine "to go to other peoples." The same may very possibly be true of Mark. If the fact be that Romans in Caesarea or Antioch made the request of Mark, we can easily understand how, by the time of Irenaeus, the whole incident might be transferred to Rome.
<P> If this view be adopted, the date would probably not be before the council at Jerusalem and the events of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</A>. It is true the New Testament hints are that the apostles had left Jerusalem before that, but that they had gone beyond Syria is not likely. At any rate, at the time of the clash at Antioch they had not become so clear on the question touching Jews and Gentiles in the church as to be "fully furnished for the work of universal evangelization." But may it not be that Paul's strong statement of the seriousness of their error actually did settle those questions in the minds of the leaders? If so, and if with new vision and ardor, they turn to the work of world-wide evangelism, that would be a natural and worthy occasion for the composition of the Gospel. The place may be Caesarea or Antioch, and the date not earlier than 50 AD. This is the simplest synthesis of the ancient testimony. Modern opinion as to date has ranged more widely than the ancient. Baur and Strauss were compelled by their tendency and mythical theories to place it in the 2nd century. Recent criticism tends strongly to a date in the sixties of the 1st century, and more commonly the later sixties. This is based partly on hints in the Gospel itself, partly on its relation to Matthew and Luke. The hints usually adduced are <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+2:26">Mark 2:26</A> and 13. The former, representing the temple as still standing, has force only if the relative clause be Mark's explanatory addition. Mark 13 has more force because, if Jerusalem had already fallen, we might expect some recognition of the fact.
<P> Two other slight hints may be mentioned. The omission by the synoptists of the raising of Lazarus, and of the name of Mary in connection with the anointing of Jesus argues an early date when mention of them might have been unpleasant for the family. When the Fourth Gospel was published, they may have been no longer alive. The description of John as the brother of James (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:37">Mark 5:37</A>) may also take us back to an early date when James was the more honored of the two brothers--though the unusual order of the names may be due, as Zahn thinks, to the author's instinctively distinguishing that John from himself.
<P> The relation of Mark to Matthew and Luke is important if the very widespread conviction of the priority of Mark be true. For the most likely date for Ac is 62 AD, as suggested by the mention of Paul's two years' residence in Rome, and Luke's Gospel is earlier than the Acts. It may well have been written at Caesarea about 60 AD; that again throws Mark back into the fifties.
<P> The great objection to so early a date is the amount of detail given of the destruction of Jerusalem. Abbott and others have marshalled numerous other objections, but they have very little weight--most of them indeed are puerile. The real crux is that to accept an earlier date than 70 AD is to admit predictive prophecy. Yet to deny that, especially for a believer in Christ, is an unwarranted pre-judgment, and even so far to reduce it as to deny its presence in this passage is to charge Luke--a confessedly careful historian--with ascribing to Jesus statements which He never made.
<P> The eagerness to date Matthew not earlier than 70 is due to the same feeling. But the problem here is complicated by the word "immediately" (24:29). Some regard that as proof positive that it must have been written before the destruction of Jerusalem. Others (e.g. Allen and Plummer) feel that it absolutely forbids a date much later than 70 AD, and consider 75 AD as a limit. But is it not possible that by by eutheos (not parachrema), Christ, speaking as a prophet, may have meant no more than that the next great event comparable with the epochal overthrow of Judaism would be His own return and that the Divine purpose marches straight on from the one to the other? The New Testament nowhere says that the second advent would take place within that generation. See below under "Eschatology." There is therefore no sufficient reason in the Olivet discourse for dating Luke or Matthew later than 60 AD, and if Mark is earlier, it goes back into the fifties.
<P> VIII. Historicity.
<P> Older rationalists, like Paulus, not denying Mark's authorship, regarded the miraculous elements as misconceptions of actual events. Strauss, regarding these as mythical, was compelled to postulate a 2nd-century date. When, however, the date was pushed back to the neighborhood of 70 AD, the historicity was felt to be largely established. But recently theory of "pragmatic values" has been developed; Bacon thus states it:
<P> "The key to all genuinely scientific appreciation of Biblical narrative .... is the recognition of motive. The motive .... is never strictly historical but always etiological and frequently apologetic. .... The evangelic tradition consists of so and so many anecdotes, told and retold for the purpose of explaining or defending beliefs and practices of the contemporary church" (Modern Commentary, Beginnings of Gospel Story, 9). Bacon works out the method with the result that Mark is charged again and again with historical and other blunders. This view, like Baur's tendency-theory, has elements of truth. One is that the vocabulary of a later day may be a sort of necessary translation of the original expression. But translation is neither invention nor perversion. The other is that each author has his purpose, but that simply determines his selection and arrangement of material; it neither creates nor misrepresents it if the author be honest and well informed. The word "selection" is advisedly chosen. The evangelists did not lack material. Each of the Twelve had personal knowledge beyond the content of Q or of Mark. These represent the central orb--the one the ethical, the other the evangelic side of it--but there were rays of exceeding brightness radiating from it in all directions. Luke's introduction and John's explicit declaration attest that fact. And neither John nor Luke throws the slightest suspicion on the reliability of the material they did not use. There is no sufficient reason for charging them with misstating the facts to make a point. Bacon seems to trust any other ancient writers or even his own imagination rather than the evangelists. The test becomes altogether too subjective. Yet since Christianity is a historical revelation, perversion of history may become perversion of most vital religious teaching. In the last analysis, the critic undertakes to decide just what Jesus could or could not have done or said. The utter uncertainty of the result is seen by a comparison of Schmiedel and Bacon. The former is sure that the cry "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me" is one of the very few genuine sayings of Jesus; Bacon is equally sure that Jesus could not have uttered it. Bacon also charges Mark with "immoral crudity" because in 10:45 he reports Jesus as saying that He came "to give his life a ransom for (anti) many." Thus, on two most vital matters he charges the evangelists with error because they run counter to his own religious opinions.
<P> Plummer's remark is just (Commentary on Matthew, xxxiii):
<P> "To decide a priori that Deity cannot become incarnate, or that incarnate Deity must exhibit such and such characteristics, is neither true philosophy nor scientific criticism." And A.T. Robertson ("Matthew" in Bible for Home and School, 26): "The closer we get to the historic Jesus the surer we feel that He lived and wrought as He is reported in the Synoptic Gospels." The evangelists had opportunities to know the facts such as we have not. The whole method of their training was such as to secure accuracy. They support each other. They have given us sketches of unparalleled beauty, vigor and power, and have portrayed for us a Person moving among men absolutely without sin--a standing miracle. If we cannot trust them for the facts, there is little hope of ever getting at the facts at all.
<P> IX. Purpose and Plan.
<P> 1. The Gospel for Romans:
<P> Mark's purpose was to write down the Gospel as Peter had presented it to Romans, so say the Fathers, at least, and internal evidence supports them. In any additions made by himself he had the same persons in mind. That the Gospel was for Gentiles can be seen (a) from the translation of the Aramaic expressions in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:17">Mark 3:17</A> (Boanerges), 5:41 (Talitha cumi), 7:11 (Corban), 10:46 (Bartimaeus), 14:36 (Abba), 15:22 (Golgotha); (b) in the explanation of Jewish customs in 14:12 and 15:42; (c) from the fact that the Law is not mentioned and the Old Testament is only once quoted in Mark's own narrative; (d) the Gentile sections, especially in Mark 6-8.
<P> That it was for Romans is seen in
<P> (a) the explanation of a Greek term by a Latin in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</A>;
<P> (b) the preponderance of works of power, the emphasis on authority (2:10), patience and heroic endurance (10:17);
<P> (c) 10:12 which forbids a practice that was not Jewish but Roman.
<P> Those who believe it was written at Rome find further hints in the mention of Rufus (15:21; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:13">Romans 16:13</A>) and the resemblance between 7:1-23 and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+14">Romans 14</A>. The Roman centurion's remark (15:39) is the Q.E.D. of the author, and bears the same relation to Mark's purpose as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+20:31">John 20:31</A> to John's.
<P> But one cannot escape the feeling that we have in this Gospel the antitype of the Servant of Yahweh. A.B. Davidson (Old Testament Theology, 365) tells us that there are two great figures around which Isaiah's thoughts gather--the King and the Servant. The former rises "to the unsurpassable height of `God with us,' `mighty God,' teaching that in Him God shall be wholly present with His people." The Servant is the other. The former is depicted in Mt, who also identifies Him with the Servant (12:18 f); the latter by Mr who identifies Him with the Messianic King (11:10; 14:62). Davidson summarizes the description of the Servant:
<P> "
<P> (1) He is God's chosen;
<P> (2) He has a mission to establish judgment on the earth. .... The word is His instrument and the Lord is in the Word, or rather He Himself is the impersonation of it;
<P> (3) His endowment is the Spirit and an invincible faith;
<P> (4) There is in Him a marvelous combination of greatness and lowliness;
<P> (5) There are inevitable sufferings--bearing the penalty of others' sins;
<P> (6) He thus redeems Israel and brings light to the Gentiles.
<P> (7) Israel's repentance and restoration precede that broader blessing."
<P> It is not strange that this Servant-conception--this remarkable blend of strength and submission, achieving victory through apparent defeat--should appeal to Peter. He was himself an ardent, whole-souled man who knew both defeat and victory. Moreover, he himself had hired servants (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:20">Mark 1:20</A>), and now for years had been a servant of Christ (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</A>). That it did appeal to him and became familiar to the early Christians can be seen from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</A> and 4:30. In his First Epistle he has 17 references to Isaiah, 9 of which belong to the second part. Temperamentally Mark seems to have been like Peter. And his experience in a wealthy home where servants were kept (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+12:13">Acts 12:13</A>), and as himself huperetes of apostles in Christian service, fitted him both to appreciate and record the character and doings of the perfect servant--the Servant of Yahweh. For Roman Christians that heroic figure would have a peculiar fascination.
<P> 2. Plan of the Gospel:
<P> The plan of the Gospel seems to have been influenced by this conception. Christ's kingship was apprehended by the Twelve at a comparatively early date. It was not until after the resurrection, when Jesus opened to them the Scriptures, that they saw Him as the Suffering Servant of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+53">Isaiah 53</A>. That gave Peter his gospel as we have already seen, and at the same time the general lines of its presentation. We see it sketched for Romans in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10">Acts 10</A>. That sketch is filled in for us by Mark. So we have the following analysis:
<P> Title:
<P> Mark 1:1
<P> 1. The Baptist preparing the way:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:2-8">Mark 1:2-8</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</A> f.
<P> 2. Devotement of Jesus to death for us and endowment by the Spirit:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:9-3">Mark 1:9-3</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</A>.
<P> 3. His greatness--the Galilean Ministry:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:14-8:30">Mark 1:14-8:30</A>; compare Isa 43-52:12.
<P> (1) In the synagogue:
<P> period of popular favor leading to break with Pharisaic Judaism: <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:14-3:6">Mark 1:14-3:6</A>.
<P> (2) Outside the synagogue:
<P> parabolic teaching of the multitude, choice and training of the Twelve and their Great Confession: <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:7">Mark 3:7</A> through 8:30.
<P> 4. His lowliness--mainly beyond Galilee:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+8:31-15">Mark 8:31-15</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+52:13-53:9">Isaiah 52:13-53:9</A>.
<P> (1) In the north--announcement of death:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+8:31-9:29">Mark 8:31-9:29</A>.
<P> (2) On the way to Jerusalem and the cross--through Galilee (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:30-50">Mark 9:30-50</A>), Peraea (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:1-45">Mark 10:1-45</A>), Judea (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:46-52">Mark 10:46-52</A>).
<P> (3) The triumphal entry into Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:1-11">Mark 11:1-11</A>).
<P> (4) In Jerusalem and vicinity--opposed by the leaders (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:12-12:44">Mark 11:12-12:44</A>); foretelling their doom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+13">Mark 13</A>); preparing for death (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:1-42">Mark 14:1-42</A>); betrayed, condemned, crucified and buried in a rich man's tomb (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:43-15">Mark 14:43-15</A>).
<P> 5. His victory--the resurrection:
<P> Mark 16; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+53:10-12">Isaiah 53:10-12</A>. What follows in Isaiah is taken up in Acts, for the first part of which Peter or Mark may have been Luke's main source.
<P> Generally speaking the plan is chronological, but it is plain that the material is sometimes grouped according to subject-matter.
<P> This Servant-conception may also be the real explanation of some of the striking features of this Gospel, e.g. the absence of a genealogy and any record of His early life; the frequent use of the word "straightway"; the predominance of deeds; the Son's not knowing the day (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+13:32">Mark 13:32</A>); and the abrupt ending at <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+16:8">Mark 16:8</A> (see III).
<P> X. Leading Doctrines.
<P> 1. Person of Christ:
<P> The main one, naturally, is the Person of Christ. The thesis is that He is Messiah, Son of God, Author (Source) of the gospel. The first half of the book closes with the disciples' confession of His Messiahship; the second, with the supreme demonstration that He is Son of God. Introductory to each is the Father's declaration of Him as His Beloved Son (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:11">Mark 1:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:7">9:7</A>). That the sonship is unique is indicated in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:6">Mark 12:6</A> and 13:32. At the same time He is the Son of Man--true man (4:38; 8:5; 14:34); ideal man as absolutely obedient to God (10:40; 14:36), and Head of humanity (2:10,28), their rightful Messiah or King (1:1; 14:62)--yet Servant of all (10:44 f); David's Son and David's Lord (12:37). The unique Sonship is the final explanation of all else, His power, His knowledge of both present (2:5,8; 8:17) and future (8:31; 10:39; 14:27; 13), superiority to all men, whether friends (1:7; 9:3) or foes (12:34), and to superhuman beings, whether good (13:32) or evil (1:13,12; 3:27).
<P> 2. The Trinity:
<P> The Father speaks in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:11">Mark 1:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:7">9:7</A>; is spoken of in 13:32; and spoken to in 14:36. The usual distinction between His fatherhood in relation to Christ and in relation to us is seen in 11:25; 12:6 and 13:32. The Spirit is mentioned in 1:8,10,12; 3:29 and 13:11. The last passage especially implies His personality.
<P> 3. Salvation:
<P> As to salvation, the Son is God's final messenger (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:6">Mark 12:6</A>); He gives His life a ransom instead of many (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:45">Mark 10:45</A>); His blood shed is thus the blood of the covenant (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:24">Mark 14:24</A>); that involves for Him death in the fullest sense, including rupture of fellowship with God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+15:34">Mark 15:34</A>). From the outset He knew what was before Him--only so can His baptism be explained (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:5,11">Mark 1:5,11</A>; compare 2:20); but the horror of it was upon Him, especially from the transfiguration onward (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:33-36">14:33-36</A>); that was the Divine provision for salvation:
<P> He gave His life (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:45">Mark 10:45</A>). The human condition is repentance and faith (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:15">Mark 1:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+2:5">2:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:34,36">5:34,36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:5">6:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:23">9:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+16:16">16:16</A>), though He bestows lesser blessings apart from personal faith (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:23-26">Mark 1:23-26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:1-20">5:1-20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:35-43">6:35-43</A>). The power of faith, within the will of God, is limitless (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</A>); faith leads to doing the will of God, and only such as do His will are Christ's true kindred (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:35">Mark 3:35</A>). Salvation is possible for Gentile as well as Jew (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:24-30">Mark 7:24-30</A>).
<P> 4. Eschatology:
<P> The eschatology of this Gospel is found chiefly in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+8:34-9:1">Mark 8:34-9:1</A> and 13. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</A> we have a prediction of the overthrow of Jerusalem which is here given as a type and proof of His final coming for judgment and reward which He has had in mind in the preceding verses. Mark 13 is a development of this--the destruction of Jerusalem being meant in 13:5-23 and 28-31, the final coming in 13:24-27 and 32. The distinction is clearly marked by the pronouns (tauta, and ekeines, in 13:30 and 32 (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:34,36">Matthew 24:34,36</A>). In each passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+13:30">13:30</A>) the fall of Jerusalem is definitely fixed as toward the close of that generation; the time of the latter is known only to the Father (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+13:32">Mark 13:32</A>). Between Christ's earthly life and the Second Coming He is seated at the right hand of God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:36">Mark 12:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+16:19">16:19</A>). The resurrection which He predicted for Himself (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:31">9:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:34">10:34</A>) and which actually took place (Mark 16), He affirms for others also (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:24-27">Mark 12:24-27</A>).
