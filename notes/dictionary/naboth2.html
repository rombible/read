( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/21-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/21-1.html">1 Kings 21:1</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/21-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/21-2.html">1 Kings 21:2</a> ) (B.C. 897.) It thus became an object of desire to the king, who offered an equivalent in money or another vineyard. In exchange for this Naboth, in the independent spirit of a Jewish landholder, refused: "The Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my father unto thee." Ahab was cowed by this reply; but the proud spirit of Jezebel was aroused. She took the matter into her own hands. A fast was proclaimed, as on the announcement of some impending calamity. Naboth was "set on high" in the public place of Samaria; two men of worthless character accused him of having "cursed God and the king." He and his children, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/9-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/9-26.html">2&nbsp;Kings 9:26</a> ) were dragged out of the city and despatched; the same night. The place of execution there was by the large tank or reservoir which still remains an the slope of the hill of Samaria, immediately outside the walls. The usual punishment for blasphemy was enforced: Naboth and his sons were stoned; and the blood from their wounds ran down into the waters of the tank below.
