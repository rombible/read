            <P><B>HOLYDAY</B><P> ho'-li-da:
<P> This word occurs twice in the King James Version, namely, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+42:4">Psalms 42:4</A>, "a multitude that kept (the Revised Version (British and American) "keeping") holyday," and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</A>. In the latter case it is a rendering of the Greek word heorte, the ordinary term for a religious festival. the Revised Version (British and American) translates "feast day." In the former instance "keeping holyday" renders choghegh. The verb means to "make a pilgrimage," or "keep a religious festival." Occasionally the idea of merrymaking prevails, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:16">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:16</A>--"eating and drinking," and enjoying themselves merrily. The Psalmist (who was perhaps an exiled priest) remembers with poignant regret how he used to lead religious processions on festival occasions.
<P> T. Lewis
