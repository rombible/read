<P> The place on the top of Pisgah to which Balak took Balaam, whence only a part of the host of Israel could be seen (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+23:14">Numbers 23:14</A>). Perhaps we should simply translate "field of watchers." Conder draws attention to the name Tal`at es-Sufa attached to an ascent leading up to the ridge of Neba from the North Here possibly is a survival of the old name. For Ramathaim-zophim see RAMAH.
