<P> The noun "delay" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+25:17">Acts 25:17</A>, "I made no delay"; the King James Version "without any delay") means "procrastination." The verb "to delay" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:29">Exodus 22:29</A>; 'achar) involves the idea "to stop for a time," the people being admonished not to discontinue a custom. The Pil. perfect of bush (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+32:1">Exodus 32:1</A>), "Moses delayed to come," expresses not only the fact that he tarried, but also the disappointment on the part of the people, being under the impression that he possibly was put to shame and had failed in his mission, which also better explains the consequent action of the people. "To delay" (chronizo) is used transitively in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:48">Matthew 24:48</A> (the Revised Version (British and American) "My lord tarrieth") and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:45">Luke 12:45</A>. The meaning here is "to prolong," "to defer."
