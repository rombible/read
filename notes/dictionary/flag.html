            <P><B>FLAG</B><P> Two Hebrew words:
<P> (1) cuph (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:3,1">Exodus 2:3,1</A>, "flags"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+19:6">Isaiah 19:6</A>, "flags"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jon+2:5">Jonah 2:5</A>, "weeds"). This is apparently a general name which includes both the fresh-water weeds growing along a river bank and "seaweeds." The Red Sea was known as Yam cuph.
<P> (2) 'achu (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+41:2,18">Genesis 41:2,18</A>, the King James Version "meadow," the Revised Version (British and American) "reed-grass"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+8:11">Job 8:11</A>, "Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag (margin "reed-grass") grow without water?"). Some such general term as "sedges" or "fens" would better meet the requirements.
