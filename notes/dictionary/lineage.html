            <P><B>LINEAGE</B><P> lin'-e-aj (patria):
<P> Found only once in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+2:4">Luke 2:4</A> (the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) "family"), and signifying the line of paternal family descent. A word pregnant in meaning among the Jews, who kept all family records with religious care, as may be seen from the long genealogical records found everywhere in the Old Testament.
