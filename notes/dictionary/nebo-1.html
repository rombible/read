            <P><B>NEBO (1)</B><P> ne'-bo (nebho; Assyrian Nabu):
<P> The Babylonian god of literature and science. In the Babylonian mythology he is represented as the son and interpreter of Bel-merodach (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+46:1">Isaiah 46:1</A>; Bel and Nebo there represent Babylon). His own special shrine was at Borsippo. His planet was Mercury. His name enters into Biblical names, as "Nebuchadnezzar," and perhaps "Abed-nego" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+1:7">Daniel 1:7</A>, for "Abed-nebo, servant of Nebo").
