            <P><B>ARKITE</B><P> ark'-it (`arqi):
<P> An inhabitant of the town of Arka, situated some ten or twelve miles Northeast of Tripoils, Syria, and about four miles from the shore of the sea. The Arkites are mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:17">Genesis 10:17</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:15</A> as being the descendants of Canaan, and they were undoubtedly of Phoenician stock. The place was not of much importance, but it is mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, under the name Irkatah and taken by Tiglathpileser III in 738 BC. Not being on the sea its trade was small and it probably belonged to Tripoli or Botrys originally. It was the birthplace of Alexander Severus, hence its Roman name, Caesarea Libani. Its site is marked by a high mound near the foothills of Lebanon.
