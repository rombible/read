The only part of the temple which answered to the modern sense of pinnacle was the golden spikes erected on the roof to prevent birds from settling there. Perhaps the word means the battlement ordered by law to be added to every roof. (According to Alford it was the roof of Herods royal portico of the temple,"which overhung the ravine of Kedron from a dizzy height" --600 or 700 feet.-ED.) </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
