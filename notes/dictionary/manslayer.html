            <P><B>MANSLAYER</B><P> man'-sla-er (meratstseach, from ratsach (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:6,12">Numbers 35:6,12</A>); androphonos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:9">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</A>)):
<P> A term employed with reference to both premeditated and accidental or justifiable killing. In the latter case, an asylum was granted (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:6,12">Numbers 35:6,12</A>) until the death of the high priest, after which the slayer was allowed to "return into the land of his possession" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:28">Numbers 35:28</A>). The cases in which the manslayer was to be held clearly immune from the punishment imposed on willful killing were:
<P> (1) death by a blow in a sudden quarrel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:22">Numbers 35:22</A>);
<P> (2) death by anything thrown at random (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:22,23">Numbers 35:22,23</A>);
<P> (3) death by the blade of an axe flying from the handle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+19:5">Deuteronomy 19:5</A>).
<P> Among the cases in which one would be held responsible for the death of another, is to be counted the neglectful act of building a house without a parapet (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+22:8">Deuteronomy 22:8</A>).
<P> Manslaughter, as a modern legal term, is employed to distinguish unpremeditated killing from coldblooded murder, but formerly (2 Esdras 1:26) it was used in a more general sense.
<P> See MURDER.
