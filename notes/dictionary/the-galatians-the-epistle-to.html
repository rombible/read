The epistle appears to have been called forth by the machinations of Judaizing teachers, who, shortly before the date of its composition, had endeavored to seduce the churches of this province into a recognition of circumcision, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/5-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/5-2.html">Galatians 5:2</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/5-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/5-11.html">Galatians 5:11</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/5-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/5-12.html">Galatians 5:12</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/6-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/6-12.html">6:12</a> ) seq., and had openly sought to depreciate the apostolic claims of St. Paul.
