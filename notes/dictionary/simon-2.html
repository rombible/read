            <P><B>SIMON (2)</B><P> si'-mon (Simon):
<P> (1) Simon Peter.
<P> See PETER (SIMON).
<P> (2) Another of the Twelve, Simon "the Cananean" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+10:4">Matthew 10:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:18">Mark 3:18</A>), "the Zealot" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:15">Luke 6:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</A>).
<P> See CANANAEAN.
<P> (3) One of the brethren of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:3">Mark 6:3</A>).
<P> See BRETHREN OF THE LORD.
<P> (4) "The leper" in Bethany, in whose house a woman poured a cruse of precious ointment over the head of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</A>). He had perhaps been healed by Jesus; in that case his ungracious behavior was not consistent with due gratitude. However he was healed, the title referred to his condition in the past, as lepers were ostracized by law.
<P> (5) A Pharisee in whose house a woman, "a sinner," wet the feet of Jesus with her tears, and anointed them with ointment (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+7:36">Luke 7:36</A>). By some he is identified with (4), this being regarded as Luke's version of the incident recorded in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26">Matthew 26</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14">Mark 14</A>. Others as strongly deny this view.
<P> For discussion see MARY, IV.
<P> (6) A man of Cyrene, who was compelled to carry the cross of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:32">Matthew 27:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+15:21">Mark 15:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:26">Luke 23:26</A>). Mark calls him "the father of Alexander and Rufus," well-known members of the church at (probably) Rome (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:33">Acts 19:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:13">Romans 16:13</A>).
<P> See CYRENIAN.
<P> The father of Judas Iscariot (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+6:71">John 6:71</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+12:4">12:4</A> the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) omits; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+13:2,26">John 13:2,26</A>).
<P> (8) Simon Magus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</A>). See separate article.
<P> (9) Simon, the tanner, with whom Peter lodged at Joppa. His house was by the seaside outside the city wall, because of its ceremonial uncleanness to a Jew, and also for reasons of sanitation (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+9:43">Acts 9:43</A>).
