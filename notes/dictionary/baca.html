<P> In the King James Version in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+84:6">Psalms 84:6</A>, where the Revised Version (British and American) has "the valley of Weeping," with a marginal variant which is best put in the form, "the valley of the balsam-trees." The word is elsewhere used only in the duplicated account of one of David's battles (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+5:23,24">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:23,24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+14:14,15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 14:14,15</A>). There the translation is "the mulberry trees," with "the balsam-trees" in the margin in the Revised Version (British and American). Conjecturally the word is, by variant spelling, of the stem which denotes weeping; the tree is called "weeper" from some habit of the trickling of its gum or of the moisture on it; the valley of weeping is not a geographical locality, but a picturesque expression for the experiences of those whose strength is in Yahweh, and who through His grace find their sorrows changed into blessings.
