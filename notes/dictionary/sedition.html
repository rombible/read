            <P><B>SEDITION</B><P> se-dish'-un:
<P> The translation in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:15,19">Ezra 4:15,19</A> for 'eshtaddur, "struggling," "revolt"; in 2 Esdras 15:16 for inconstabilitio, "instability" with "be seditious" for stasiazo, "rise in rebellion" in 2 Macc 14:6. In addition, the King James Version has "sedition" for stasis, "standing up," "revolt" (the Revised Version (British and American) "insurrection") in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:19,25">Luke 23:19,25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</A>, with (dichostasia), "a standing asunder" (the Revised Version (British and American) "division") in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</A>. As "sedition" does not include open violence against a government, the word should not have been used in any of the above cases.
