            <P><B>TOWER OF IVORY</B><P> (mighdal hashen):
<P> Occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+7:4">Song of Solomon 7:4</A>. Cheyne would, not unreasonably, emend the text and read the "tower of Shenir" as a parallel to the "tower of Lebanon" in the same verse. If the reading "tower of ivory" is correct, the reference must be to some piece of furniture in the adornment of which ivory was much used, and when we compare the word mighdal here with its use for a "pulpit" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:4">Nehemiah 8:4</A>, we can think only of a reminiscence of something of the nature of the throne of ivory made by Solomon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:18">1&nbsp;Kings 10:18</A>).
