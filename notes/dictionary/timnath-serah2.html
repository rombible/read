( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/24-30.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/24-30.html">Joshua 24:30</a> ) It is specified as "in Mount Ephraim on the north side of Mount Gaash." In ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/2-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/2-9.html">Judges 2:9</a> ) the name is altered to TIMNATH-HERES. The latter form is that adopted by the Jewish writers. Accordingly, they identify the place with <I>Kefar-cheres</I> , which is said by Jewish travellers to be about five miles south of Shechem (<I>Nablus</I> ). No place with that name appears on the maps. Another identification has, however been suggested by Dr. Eli Smith. In his journey from <I>Jifna</I> to <I>Mejdel-Yaba</I> , about six miles from the former he discovered the ruins of a considerable town. Opposite the town was a much higher hill, in the north side of which are several excavated sepulchres. The whole bears the name of <I>Tibneh</I> . </FONT></body></html>
