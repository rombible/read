            <P><B>HYPOCRISY; HYPROCRITE</B><P> hi-pok'-ri-si, hip'-o-krit (choneph, chaneph; hupokrisis, hupokrites):
<P> (1) "Hypocrisy" occurs only once in the Old Testament as the translation of choneph (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+32:6">Isaiah 32:6</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "profaneness"); chaneph, from which it is derived, means properly "to cover," "to hide," or "becloud," hence, to pollute, to be polluted or defiled, to make profane, to seduce; as a substantive it is translated "hypocrite" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+8:13">Job 8:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+13:16">13:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+15:34">15:34</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+17:8">17:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+20:5">20:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+27:8">27:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+34:30">34:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+36:13">36:13</A>, in all which instances the Revised Version (British and American) has "godless man," "godless men," "godless"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+11:9">Proverbs 11:9</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "the godless man"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+9:17">Isaiah 9:17</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "profane"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+33:14">Isaiah 33:14</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "the godless ones"); it is rendered "hypocritical," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+35:16">Psalms 35:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:6">Isaiah 10:6</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "profane."
<P> (2) "Hypocrisy," "hypocrite" are frequent in the New Testament, chiefly in Christ's discourses in the Gospels. The word hupokrisis (primarily, "an answer," "response") meant generally, in classical Greek, stageplaying, acting, the histrionic art; hence, it came to mean acting a part in life, etc. We find hupokrisis in this sense in 2 Macc 6:25, the Revised Version (British and American) "dissimulation," and hupokrinomai, "to pretend," "to feign," etc. Ecclesiasticus 1:29; 32:15; 33:2, translated "hypocrite"; 2 Macc 5:25, "pretending peace," the Revised Version (British and American) "playing the man of peace"; 6:21, the Revised Version (British and American) "to make as if." Hupokrites (literally, "an actor") is the Septuagint for chaneph (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+34:30">Job 34:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+36:13">36:13</A>), equivalent to bad, wicked, godless, which is perhaps included in some of our Lord's uses of the words, e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:27">Matthew 23:27</A>, "full of hypocrisy and iniquity" (compare 23:29; 24:51); but, in general, the meaning is acting a part, false, deceptive and deceived, formally and outwardly religious and good, but inwardly insincere and unrighteous; the hypocrite may come to deceive himself as well as others, but "the hypocrite's hope shall perish" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+8:13">Job 8:13</A> the King James Version). On no class did our Lord pronounce such severe condemnation as on the hypocrites of His day.
