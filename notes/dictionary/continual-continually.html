<P> Without cessation, although there may be intervals between its presence; that which regularly recurs throughout a period, as has <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+24:53">Luke 24:53</A>: "(They) were continually in the temple"; "lest .... by her continual coming" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+18:5">Luke 18:5</A>). In Old Testament for Hebrew tadhir, "pursue," as one drop of rain follows another in swift succession, but more frequently by tamidh for offerings repeated at intervals, as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+29:42">Exodus 29:42</A>; occasionally the Hebrew the phrase literally meaning "all the day" (kol ha-yom), as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:5">Genesis 6:5</A>. In the New Testament most frequently for dia pantos, "through all" ("always" <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</A>), "sometimes," adialeiptos, "incessantly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:2">Romans 9:2</A> the King James Version) and dienekes, "continuously" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+7:3">Hebrews 7:3</A>).
