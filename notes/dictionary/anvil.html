            <P><B>ANVIL</B><P> an'-vil (pa`am):
<P> The word is used only once to mean anvil. The passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+41:7" target="_blank">Isaiah 41:7</A>) refers to the custom still very common of workmen encouraging each other at their work. See <a href="crafts.html">CRAFTS</a>. Just how pretentious the anvil of the ancients was we do not know. Most work requiring striking or beating, from the finest wrought jewelry to the largest copper vessels, is now done on an anvil shaped like an inverted letter L which is driven into a block of wood, or into the ground, or into a crack between two of the stone slabs of the workman's floor. The only massive anvils seen in the country today are modern and of foreign make.
