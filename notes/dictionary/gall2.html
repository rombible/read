Other writers have supposed, and with some reason, from ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/32-32.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/32-32.html"> 32:32</a> ) that some berry-bearing plant must be intended. Gesenius understands poppies; in which case the gall mingled with the wine offered to our Lord at his crucifixion, and refused by him, would be an anaesthetic, and tend to diminish the sense of suffering. Dr. Richardson, "Ten Lectures on Alcohol," p. 23, thinks these drinks were given to the crucified to diminish the suffering through their intoxicating effects. </OL></FONT></body></html>
