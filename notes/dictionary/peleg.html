            <P><B>PELEG</B><P> pe'-leg (pelegh, "watercourse," "division"):
<P> A son of Eber, and brother of Joktan. The derivation of the name is given: "for in his days was the earth divided" (niphleghah) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:25">Genesis 10:25</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+3:35">Luke 3:35</A>, the King James Version "Phalec"). This probably refers to the scattering of the world's population and the confounding of its language recorded in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+11:1-9">Genesis 11:1-9</A>. In Aramaic pelagh and Arabic phalaj mean "division"; in Hebrew pelegh means "watercourse." The name may really be due to the occupation by this people of some well-watered (furrowed), district (e.g. in Babylonia), for these patronymics represent races, and the derivation in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:25">Genesis 10:25</A> is a later editor's remark.
