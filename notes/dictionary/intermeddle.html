            <P><B>INTERMEDDLE</B><P> in-ter-med'-'-l (`arabh, "to mix up (self) with something," "mingle in," "share," "take interest in"):
<P> The word occurs only once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+14:10">Proverbs 14:10</A>) in a passage descriptive of "the ultimate solitude of each man's soul at all times." "The heart knoweth its own bitterness."
<P> "Nor even the tenderest heart, and next our own, Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh."
<P> (Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+8:38">1&nbsp;Kings 8:38</A>.) Something there is in every sorrow which no one else can share. "And a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy," not necessarily in an interfering or any offensive way, but simply does not share or take any interest in the other's joy.
<P> For "intermeddleth with" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+18:1">Proverbs 18:1</A> the King James Version), the Revised Version (British and American) gives "rageth against" (margin "quarrelleth with").
<P> M. O. Evans
