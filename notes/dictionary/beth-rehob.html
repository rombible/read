            <P><B>BETH-REHOB</B><P> beth-re'-hob (beth-rechobh; ho oikos Rhaab) :
<P> An Aramean town and district which, along with Zobah and Maacah, assisted Ammon against David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+10:6,8">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:6,8</A>, Rehob). It is probably identical with Rehob (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+13:21">Numbers 13:21</A>), the northern limit of the spies' journey. Laish-Da (probably Tell el-Kadi) was situated near it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+18:28">Judges 18:28</A>). The site of the town is unknown. It has been conjecturally identified with Hunin, West of Banias, and, more plausibly, with Banias itself (Thomson, The Land and the Book (2), 218; Buhl, Geog., 240; Moore, ICC, Jgs, 399).
