            <P><B>ENAIM</B><P> e-na'-im (`enayim, "place of a fountain"; Ainan; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:14">Genesis 38:14</A> (the King James Version "in an open place"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:21">Genesis 38:21</A> the King James Version "openly")):
<P> A place which lay between Adullam and Timnath; probably the same as Enam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:34">Joshua 15:34</A>). Also mentioned in close connection with Adullam. It was in the Shephelah of Judah. The Talmud (Pesik. Rab. 23) mentions a Kephar Enaim. Conder proposes Khurbet Wady `Alin, which is an ancient site, evidently of great strength and importance, lying between Kh. `Ain Shems and the village of Deir Aban. The ruins crown a lofty and almost isolated hill; the greatest objection to the identification is that there is no fountain at all in the immediate neighborhood. There may have been one in earlier times. See PEF, III, 128.
