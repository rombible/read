            <P><B>OUTGOING</B><P> out'-go-ing:
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+65:8">Psalms 65:8</A>, "Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice," the Hebrew is motsa'. The word (from yatsa', "to go forth") refers to the "going forth" of the sun, and so means "east" (as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+75:6">Psalms 75:6</A>). The connection of motsa' with "evening" is therefore zeugmatic, but the meaning is clear and there are extra-Biblical parallels (compare "the two Orients"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+17:18">Joshua 17:18</A>, the King James Version uses "outgoings" for the Hebrew totsa'oth (also from yatsa'), where the meaning is "extremity" (the Revised Version (British and American) "goings out," as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:5">Numbers 34:5</A>, etc.). "Outwent" occurs in the margin of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:33">Mark 6:33</A>.
