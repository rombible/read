            <P><B>BEETLE</B><P> be'-t'-l (the Revised Version (British and American) <a href="cricket.html" target="_blank">CRICKET</a>; chargol; See <a href="locust.html" target="_blank">LOCUST</a>):
<P> This name occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:22">Leviticus 11:22</A> as one of four winged Jumping insects (sherets ha-`oph) which may be eaten. It certainly is not a beetle and is probably not a cricket. Probably all four are names of locusts, of which more than 30 species have been described from Syria and Palestine, and for which there are at least 8 Arabic names in use, though with little distinction of species. Closely allied to chargol are the Arabic charjalet, a troop of horses or a flight of locusts, from charjal, "to gallop," and harjawan, "a wingless locust."
