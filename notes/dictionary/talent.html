            <P><B>TALENT</B><P> tal'-ent (kikkar; talanton):
<P> A weight composed of 60 manehs (English Versions of the Bible "pounds") equal to about 120 pounds troy and 96 pounds avoirdupois, or 672,500 grains, of the Phoenician standard. See <a href="weights-and-measures.html" target="_blank">WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</a>. When used in the monetary sense the talent might be either of silver or gold, and the value varied according to the standard, but is probably to be taken on the Phoenician, which would give about 410 British pounds, or ,050 (in 1915), for the silver talent and 6,150 British pounds or ,750 (in 1915), for the gold.
<P> See <a href="money.html" target="_blank">MONEY</a>.
<P> Figurative:
<P> "Talent," like "pound," is used metaphorically in the New Testament for mental and spiritual attainments or gifts (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+25:15-28">Matthew 25:15-28</A>).
