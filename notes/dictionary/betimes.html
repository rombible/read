            <P><B>BETIMES</B><P> be-timz':
<P> In the sense of "early" is the translation of two Hebrew words:
<P> (1) shakham, a root meaning "to incline the shoulder to a load," hence "to load up," "start early":
<P> in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+26:31">Genesis 26:31</A> "they rose up betimes in the morning," also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+36:15">2&nbsp;Chronicles 36:15</A> (the American Standard Revised Version "early");
<P> (2) of shachar, a root meaning "to dawn" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+8:5">Job 8:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+24:5">24:5</A>, the American Standard Revised Version "diligently," and in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+13:24">Proverbs 13:24</A>, "chasteneth him betimes."
<P> In the Apocrypha (Sirach 6:36) "betimes" is the translation of orthizo, literally, "to rise early in the morning," while in Bel and the Dragon verse 16 the same word is translated "betime."
<P> In other cases the King James Version "betimes" appears as "before the time" (Sirach 51:30); "early" (1 Macc 4:52; 11:67); "the mourning" (1 Macc 5:30).
<P> Arthur J. Kinsella
