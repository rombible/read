( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/4-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/4-11.html">Judges 4:11</a> ) Its situation is defined as "near Kedesh," i.e. Kedesh-naphtali, the name of which still lingers on the high ground north of <I>Safed</I> and two or three miles west of the lake of <I>el-Huleh</I> (waters of Merom). This whole region abounds in oaks. </FONT></body></html>
