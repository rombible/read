Their character is mainly fixed by the climate and the style of architecture, the narrowness being due to the extreme heat, and the gloominess to the circumstance of the windows looking for the most part into the inner court. The street called "Straight," in Damascus, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/9-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/9-11.html">Acts 9:11</a> ) was an exception to the rule of narrowness: it was a noble thoroughfare, one hundred feet wide. divided in the Roman age by colonnades into three avenues, the central one for foot passengers, the side passages for vehicles and horsemen going in different directions. The shops and warehouses were probably collected together into bazaars in ancient as in modern times. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/37-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/37-21.html">Jeremiah 37:21</a> ) That streets occasionally had names appears from ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/37-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/37-21.html">Jeremiah 37:21</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/9-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/9-11.html">Acts 9:11</a> ) That they were generally unpaved may be inferred from the notices of the pavement laid by Herod the Great at Antioch, and by Herod Agrippa II. at Jerusalem. Hence pavement forms one of the peculiar features of the ideal Jerusalem. Tob. 13:17; ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/21-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/21-21.html">Revelation 21:21</a> ) Each street and bazaar in a modern town is locked up at night; the same custom appears to have prevailed in ancient times.
