            <P><B>BAAL-PERAZIM</B><P> ba-al-pe-ra'-zim, ba-al-per'-azim ba`al peratsim; Baal'pharasein, ("the lord of breakings through"):
<P> The spot in or near the Valley of Rephaim where David obtained a signal victory over the Philistines; it was higher than Jerusalem for David asked, "Shall I go up against the Philis?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+5:20" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+14:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 14:11</A>). The exact site is unknown, but if the Vale of Rephaim is el Beka`a, the open valley between Jerusalem and Mar Elias, then Baal-perazim would probably be the mountains to the East near what is called the "Mount of Evil Counsel" (see <a href="rainfall-in-jerusalem-in-inches.html">JERUSALEM</a>). The Mount Perazim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:21">Isaiah 28:21</A> would appear to be the same spot.
