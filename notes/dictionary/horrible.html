<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+5:30">Jeremiah 5:30</A> sha`arur, "vile," "horrible," is translated "horrible," "a wonderful and horrible thing" the Revised Version margin "astonishment and horror"; also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+23:14">Jeremiah 23:14</A>; in 18:13; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+6:10">Hosea 6:10</A> it is sha`aruri; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+11:6">Psalms 11:6</A> we have zil`aphah, "heat," the Revised Version (British and American) "burning wind"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+40:2">Psalms 40:2</A> sha'on, "noise," "tumult," "He brought me up .... out of a horrible pit," the Revised Version margin "a pit of tumult" (or destruction). Horribly is the translation of sa`ar, "to shudder," "to be whirled away," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+2:12">Jeremiah 2:12</A>, and of sa`ar, "fear," "trembling," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+32:10">Ezekiel 32:10</A>; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:35">Ezekiel 27:35</A> the Revised Version (British and American) has "horribly afraid" (sa`ar) for "sore afraid."
