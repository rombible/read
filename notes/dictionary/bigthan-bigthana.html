            <P><B>BIGTHAN; BIGTHANA</B><P> big'-than big-tha'-na (bighethan, bighethana'; Septuagint omits name):
<P> One of the two chamberlains or eunuchs of Xerxes on ("Ahasuerus") who conspired against the king's life, the conspiracy being detected by Mordecai and the culprits hanged (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+2:21">Esther 2:21</A>). Possibly these men had been partially superseded by the degradation of Vashti and were thus prompted to take revenge Xerxes.
