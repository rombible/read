            <P><B>DUMB</B><P> dum (alam, 'illem, literally, "tied in the tongue"; kophos):
<P> Used either as expressing the physical condition of speechlessness, generally associated with deafness, or figuratively as meaning the silence produced by the weight of God's judgments (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+39:2-9">Psalms 39:2-9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+10:15">Daniel 10:15</A>) or the oppression of external calamity (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+38:13">Psalms 38:13</A>). As an adjective it is used to characterize inefficient teachers destitute of spirituality ("dumb dogs," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+56:10">Isaiah 56:10</A>). The speechlessness of Saul's companions (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</A>) was due to fright; that of the man without the wedding garment was because he had no excuse to give (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+22:12">Matthew 22:12</A>). Idols are called mute, because helpless and voiceless (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+2:18,19">Habakkuk 2:18,19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+12:2">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:2</A>). The dumbness of the sheep before the shearer is a token of submission  (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+53:7">Isaiah 53:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+8:32">Acts 8:32</A>).
<P> Temporary dumbness was inflicted as a sign upon Ezekiel (3:26; 24:27; 33:22) and as a punishment for unbelief upon Zacharias (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:22">Luke 1:22</A>). There are several cases recorded of our Lord's healing the dumb (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+15:30">Matthew 15:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:37">Mark 7:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+11:14">Luke 11:14</A>, etc.). Dumbness is often associated with imbecility and was therefore regarded as due to demoniac possession (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+9:32">Matthew 9:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+12:22">12:22</A>). The evangelists therefore describe the healing of these as effected by the casting out of demons.
<P> This is especially noted in the case of the epileptic boy (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:17">Mark 9:17</A>). The deaf man with the impediment in his speech (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:32">Mark 7:32</A>) is said to have been cured by loosening the string of his tongue. This does not necessarily mean that he was tongue- tied, which is a condition causing lisping, not stammering; he was probably one of those deaf persons who produce babbling, incoherent and meaningless sounds. I saw in the asylum in Jerusalem a child born blind and deaf, who though dumb, produced inarticulate noises.
<P> In an old 14th-century psalter "dumb" is used as a verb in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+39">Psalms 39</A>:
<P> "I doumbed and meked and was ful stille."
<P> Alexander Macalister
