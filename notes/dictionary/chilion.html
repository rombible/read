            <P><B>CHILION</B><P> kil'-i-on (kilyon, "pining," "wasting away"):
<P> One of the two sons of Elimelech and Naomi, "Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+1:2">Ruth 1:2</A>). With his mother and brother he came into Moab and there both married Moabite women, Orpah being the name of Chilion's wife and Ru that of the wife of Mahlon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+4:9,10">Ruth 4:9,10</A>). Both died early and Orpah remained in Moab while Ru accompanied Naomi back to Bethlehem. When Boaz married Ru he "bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's, and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+4:9">Ruth 4:9</A>).
