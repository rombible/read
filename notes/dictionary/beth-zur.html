            <P><B>BETH-ZUR</B><P> beth'-zur (beth-tsur; Baith-sour, "house of rock"; less probably "house of the god Zur"):
<P> (1) Mentioned (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:58">Joshua 15:58</A>) as near Halhul and Gedor in the hill country of Judah; fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:7">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:7</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:16">Nehemiah 3:16</A> mention is made of "Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur." During the Maccabean wars it (Bethsura) came into great importance (1 Macc 4:29,61; 6:7,26,31,49,50; 9:52; 10:14; 11:65; 14:7,33). Josephus describes it as the strongest place in all Judea (Ant., XIII, v, 6). It was inhabited in the days of Eusebius and Jerome.
<P> (2) It is the ruined site Belt Cur, near the main road from Jerusalem to Hebron, and some 4 miles North of the latter. Its importance lay in its natural strength, on a hilltop dominating the highroad, and also in its guarding the one southerly approach for a hostile army by the Vale of Elah to the Judean plateau. The site today is conspicuous from a distance through the presence of a ruined medieval tower. (See PEF, III, 311, Sh XXI).
