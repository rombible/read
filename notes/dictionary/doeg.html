<P> "The Edomite," a servant of Saul, who watched David's intercourse with the priest Ahimelech, then denounced the priest to the king, and later executed his command to slay the priests at Nob. The position he held is described as that of "the mightiest" of Samuel's herdsmen (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+21:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:7</A> margin). Septuagint reads: "tending the mules." Rabbinical legends speak of him as the greatest scholar of his time. The traditional title of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+52">Psalms 52</A> associates the composition of that Psalms with the events that led to the slaying of the priests (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+21:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+22:9,18,22">22:9,18,22</A>).
