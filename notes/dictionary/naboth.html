<P> The owner of a vineyard contiguous to the palace of King Ahab. The king desired, by purchase or exchange, to add the vineyard to his own grounds. Naboth, however, refused to part on any terms with his paternal inheritance. This refusal made Ahab "heavy and displeased" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+21:4">1&nbsp;Kings 21:4</A>). Jezebel, the king's wife, then took the matter in hand, and by false accusation on an irrelevant charge procured the death of Naboth by stoning (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+21:7-14">1&nbsp;Kings 21:7-14</A>). As Ahab was on his way to take possession of the vineyard he met Elijah the prophet, who denounced his vile act and pronounced judgment on king and royal house. A temporary respite was given to Ahab because of a repentant mood (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+21:27-29">1&nbsp;Kings 21:27-29</A>); but later the blow fell, first upon himself in a conflict with Syria (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+22:34-40">1&nbsp;Kings 22:34-40</A>); then upon his house through a conspiracy of Jehu, in which Jehoram, Ahab's son, and Jezebel, his wife, were slain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+9:25-26,30">2&nbsp;Kings 9:25-26,30</A>). In both cases the circumstances recalled the foul treatment of Naboth.
