            <P><B>ANIM</B><P> a'-nim (`anim, "springs"):
<P> One of the cities of the hill country of Judah mentioned immediately after Eshtemoa (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:50">Joshua 15:50</A>). It is probably represented by the double ruin of el Ghuwein situated South of es Semu`a. The surface remains are Byzantine--a Christian town called Anem was here in the 4th century, but it is clearly an ancient site of importance (PEF, III, 408, Sh, XXV).
