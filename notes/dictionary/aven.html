<P> Used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+30:17">Ezekiel 30:17</A> for On or Heliopolis, in Egypt. See ON. As a term of contempt Hosea calls Beth-el "Beth-aven" (4:15; 10:5). So Amos speaks of some valley near Damascus as "the valley of Aven" (that is, of the idol, 1:5), in which Baalbek (Heliopolis) was situated. The word is rendered "idol" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+66:3">Isaiah 66:3</A>.
