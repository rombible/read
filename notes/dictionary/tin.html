            <P><B>TIN</B><P> tin (bedhil):
<P> Tin is mentioned with brass, iron and lead in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:22">Numbers 31:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+22:18,20">Ezekiel 22:18,20</A>. Ezekiel mentions tin along with silver, iron and lead as being imported into Tyre from Tarshish (see METALS ). The tin must have been brought in the form of ore and smelted in Syria. The writer has some slag dug from a deposit near Beirut which yielded nearly pure tin. It was probably the site of an ancient smelter's shop.
