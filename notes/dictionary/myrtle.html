<P> The myrtle, Myrtus communis (Natural Order Myrtaceae), is a very common indigenous shrub all over Palestine. On the bare hillsides it is a low bush, but under favorable conditions of moisture it attains a considerable height (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+1:8,10">Zechariah 1:8,10</A>). It has dark green, scented leaves, delicate starry white flowers and dark-colored berries, which are eaten. In ancient times it was sacred to Astarte. It is mentioned as one of the choice plants of the land (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+41:19">Isaiah 41:19</A>). "Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+55:13">Isaiah 55:13</A>), is one of the prophetic pictures of God's promised blessings. It was one of the trees used in the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:15">Nehemiah 8:15</A>): "the branches of thick trees" (which see) are interpreted in the Talmud (Cuk. 3 4; Yer Cuk. 3, 53rd) as myrtle boughs; also (id) the "thick trees" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:15">Nehemiah 8:15</A> as "wild myrtle." Myrtle twigs, particularly those of the broadleaved variety, together with a palm branch and twigs of willow, are still used in the ritual of the Feast of Tabernacles. For many references to myrtle in Jewish writings see Jewish Encyclopedia, IX, 137.
