            <P><B>JADON</B><P> ja'-don (yadhon, perhaps "he will judge" or "plead"):
<P> One who helped to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem in company with the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:7">Nehemiah 3:7</A>). He is called the "Meronothite," and another Meronothite is referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:30">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:30</A>, but there is no mention of a place Meronoth. Jadon is the name given by Josephus (Ant., VIII, viii, 5; ix, 1) to "the man of God" from Judah who confronted Jeroboam as he burned incense at the altar in Bethel, and who was afterward deceived by the lie of the old prophet (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+13">1&nbsp;Kings 13</A>). Josephus may probably have meant Iddo the seer, whose visions concerning Jeroboam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:29">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:29</A>) led to his being identified in Jewish tradition with "the man of God", from Judah.
