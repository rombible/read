            <P><B>HUKKOK</B><P> huk'-ok (chuqqoq):
<P> A town on the border of Naphtali named with Aznoth-tabor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:34">Joshua 19:34</A>). It is usually identified with the village of yaquq, which stands on the West of Wady el-`Amud, to the Northwest of Gennesaret, about 4 miles from the sea. This would fall on the boundary of Zebulun and Naphtali, between Tabor and Hannathon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:14">Joshua 19:14</A>). The identification may be correct; but it seems too far from Tabor.
