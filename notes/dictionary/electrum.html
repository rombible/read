<P> The Revised Version, margin rendering of chashmal, of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+1:4,27">Ezekiel 1:4,27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+8:2">8:2</A> Septuagint elektron, Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.) electrum). Both the King James Version and the English Revised Version have "amber" while the American Standard Revised Version has "glowing metal." Gesenius says electrum must not be understood as being here used for amber, but for a kind of metal remarkable for brightness, compounded of gold and silver. "Amber" is undoubtedly a poor rendering, as the Hebrew term means "polished brass." the American Standard Revised Version has the more correct rendering. Amber, however, may well have been known to Ezekiel (Encyclopaedia Biblica, which see).
