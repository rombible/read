            <P><B>SCOFF; SCOFFER</B><P> skof, skof'-er:
<P> The verb indicates the manifestation of contempt by insulting words or actions; it combines bitterness with ridicule. It is much more frequent in the Revised Version (British and American) than in the King James Version, replacing "scorn" of the latter in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+1:1">Psalms 1:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+1:22">Proverbs 1:22</A>, etc. "Scorn" refers rather to an inner emotion based on a sense of superiority; "scoff," to the outward expression of this emotion.
