            <P><B>LAPWING</B><P> lap'-wing (dukhiphath; epops):
<P> A translation used in early VSS, now universally admitted to be incorrect. The lapwing had a crest, and resembled in size and color the hoopoe (Upupa epops). It appears in the lists of abominations only (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:19">Leviticus 11:19</A> the King James Version and De 14:18 the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) HOOPOE, which see). The lapwing is a plover, and its flesh and eggs are delicious food.
