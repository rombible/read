            <P><B>KEDESH (1)</B><P> ke'-desh (qedhesh; Kades):
<P> (1) One of the "uttermost cities" of Judah "toward the border of Edom in the South" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:23">Joshua 15:23</A>). Possibly it is to be identified with KADESH-BARNEA (which see); otherwise it is strange that this latter should be omitted from the list. Dillmann would identify it with Kadus, to the South of Hebron, mentioned by Muqaddasi.
<P> (2) A town in the territory of Issachar, given to the Gershonite Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:72">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:72</A>). In the list of Joshua (21:28) its place is taken by KISHION (which see). Conder suggests identification with Tell Abu Qades, near Megiddo.
<P> (3) Kedesh-naphtali, the famous city of refuge in the uplands of Naphtali. It is called "Kedesh," simply, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:22">Joshua 12:22</A>, etc.; Kedesh-naphtali in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+4:6">Judges 4:6</A>; Tobit 1:2; Kedesh in Galilee in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+20:7">Joshua 20:7</A>, etc. It was assigned to the Gershonite Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:76">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:76</A>). From the name "holy," we gather that it was a sanctuary from old time. It was therefore a place of asylum, and only preserved its ancient character in this respect when chosen as one of the cities of refuge. It was the home of Barak, and here his host assembled. When the Assyrians invaded the land under Tiglath-pileser, it was among the first cities to be captured, and its inhabitants were deported (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+15:29">2&nbsp;Kings 15:29</A>). Near Kedesh was fought the great battle between Jonathan the Maccabee and Demetrius (1 Macc 11:63). Josephus says that in his time it belonged to the Tyrians, lying between their land and that of Galilee (Ant., XIII, v, 6; B J, II, xviii, 1; IV, ii, 3, etc.). Eusebius, Onomasticon places it 20 miles from Tyre, near to Paneas. It is represented by the modern village of Kedes, which lies on the plateau to the West of el-Chuleh. It crowns a tell which runs out in a low ridge into the little plain to the West. Near the fountain, which rises under the ridge to the North, are the most interesting of the ancient remains. There are many fine sarcophagi, some of them being used as watering-troughs. From its lofty situation, Kedesh commanded a spacious view over a richly varied landscape, With smiling cornfields, and hills clothed with oak and terebinth.
