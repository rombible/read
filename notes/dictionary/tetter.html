<P> The term "freckled spot" in the King James Version is thus rendered in the Revised Version (British and American). The eruption referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:39">Leviticus 13:39</A> is a pale white spot on the skin. This is described by Gorraeus as an eruption arising from a diseased state of the system without roughness of skin, scales or ulceration. It did not render the sufferer unclean, although it is difficult of cure. The disease is commonly known by its Latin name vitiligo. Pliny recommended the use of capers and lupins to remove it.
<P> See FRECKLED SPOT; LEPROSY.
