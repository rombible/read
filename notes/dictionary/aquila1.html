( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-2.html">Acts 18:2</a> ) (A.D, 52,) He was a native of Pontus, but had fled with his wife Priscilla, from Rome, in consequence of an order of Claudius commanding all Jews to leave the city. He became acquainted with St. Paul, and they abode together, and wrought at their common trade of making the Cilician tent or hair-cloth. On the departure of the apostle from Corinth, a year and eight months after, Priscilla and Aquila accompanied him to Ephesus. There they remained and there they taught Apollos. At what time they became Christians is uncertain. </FONT></body></html>
