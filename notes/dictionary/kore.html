            <P><B>KORE</B><P> ko-'re (qore, "one who proclaims"):
<P> (1) A Levite of David's time, descended from Kohath and Korah. See KORAH, 4. Shallum, Chief doorkeeper in the latest Bible times, is described as "the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:19</A>). This expression omits the generations between Shallum and Kore, and those between Kore and Ebidsaph, perhaps 15 generations or more in each case. The context supplies two of the omitted names, of the time of David, Meshelemiah and his son Zechariah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:21,22">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:21,22</A>). The record for the time of David mentions these two, with some particulars, calling Meshelemiah the son of Kore (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:1,2,9,14">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:1,2,9,14</A>). It describes them as "Korahites" "of the sons of Asaph." It is usual to regard this last clause as a variant for "the son of Ebiasaph," thus making the description identical with that in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:19</A>. With this understanding, the text claims that "the Korahites," Kore and Meshelemiah and Zechariah, come midway in a line of sanctuary ministrants, extending continuously from Moses to Nehemiah.
<P> (2) "The son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate," who "was over the freewill-offerings," in the time of Hezekiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+31:14">2&nbsp;Chronicles 31:14</A>). Very likely in the same line with (1) above.
<P> (3) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:1">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:1</A> the King James Version for KORAHITES (which see).
