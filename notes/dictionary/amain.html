            <P><B>AMAIN</B><P> a-man' (translated from the Greek eis phugen hormesan, "they rushed to flight"):
<P> The word is composed of the prefix "a" and the word "main," meaning "force." The expression is used by Milton, Parker, et al., but in Biblical literature found only in 2 Macc 12:22 where used to describe the flight of Timotheus and his army after he suffered defeat at the hands of Judas Maccabee ("They fled amain," i.e. violently and suddenly).
