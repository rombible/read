<P> qiryath-chutsoth, "city of streets"; Septuagint reads) poleis epauleon, "city of villages," from which we may infer a reading chatseroth, for chutsoth; the King James Version, Kirjathhuzoth): A place to which, after their meeting, Balak and Balaam went together (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+22:39">Numbers 22:39</A>). They met at "the City of Moab" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+22:36">Numbers 22:36</A>), which is probably identical with KIR OF MOAB (which see); Kiriath-huzoth was probably therefore not far from that city. Some would identify it with Kiriathaim; some with Kerioth; as yet there is no certainty.
