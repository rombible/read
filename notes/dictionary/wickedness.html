            <P><B>WICKEDNESS</B><P> wik'-ed-nes:
<P> 1. In the Old Testament:
<P> The state of being wicked; a mental disregard for justice, righteousness, truth, honor, virtue; evil in thought and life; depravity; sinfulness; criminality. See SIN. Many words are rendered "wickedness." There are many synonyms for wickedness in English and also in the Hebrew. Pride and vanity lead to it:
<P> "All the proud, and all that work wickedness (rish`ah) shall be stubble" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mal+4:1">Malachi 4:1</A>). Akin to this is the word `awen, "iniquity," "vanity": "She eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:20">Proverbs 30:20</A>). Then we have the word hawwah, meaning "mischief," "calamity," coming from inward intent upon evil: "Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+52:7">Psalms 52:7</A>); zimmah, "wickedness" in thought, carnality or lust harbored: "And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+20:14">Leviticus 20:14</A>); `awlah, "perverseness," "Neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+7:10">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:10</A>). The word for evil ra`) is many times employed to represent wickedness: "Remember all their wickedness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+7:2">Hosea 7:2</A>). Wickedness like all forms and thoughts of wrong, kept warm in mind, seems to be a thing of growth; it begins with a thought, then a deed, then a character, and finally a destiny. Even in this life men increase in wickedness till they have lost all desire for that which is good in the sight of God and good men; the men in the vision of Isaiah seem to be in a condition beyond which the human heart cannot go: "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+5:20">Isaiah 5:20</A>). Shades of thought are added by such words as roa`, "evil," "badness": "Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+28:4">Psalms 28:4</A>). And resha` or rish`ah, also gives the common thought of wrong, wickedness. The prophets were strong in denunciations of all iniquity, perverseness, and in announcing the curse of God which would certainly follow.
<P> 2. In the New Testament:
<P> Wickedness, malignity, evil in thought and purpose is presented by the word poneria:
<P> "But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+22:18">Matthew 22:18</A>). Jesus points out the origin of all wrong: "For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed .... wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness .... all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:21-23">Mark 7:21-23</A>). See Imitation of Christ, xiii, 5.
