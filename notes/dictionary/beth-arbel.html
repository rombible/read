<P> The scene of a terrific disaster inflicted on the inhabitants by Shalman (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+10:14" target="_blank">Hosea 10:14</A>). If the place intended was in Palestine, and was not the famous city of that name on the Euphrates, then probably it should be identified either with Irbid (or Irbil) in Galilee, or with Irbid, which corresponds to Arbela of the Eusebius, Onomasticon, East of the Jordan, about 12 miles Southeast of Gadara. If, as Schrader thinks (COT, II, 140), Shalman stands for the Moabite king, Shalamanu, a tributary of Tiglath-pileser, the eastern town would be the more natural identification. Possibly however the reference is to Shalmaneser III or IV. For the Galilean site, see <a href="arbela.html">ARBELA</a>; see also DB, under the word
