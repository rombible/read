<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+23:2">Deuteronomy 23:2</A> probably the offspring of an incestuous union, or of a marriage within the prohibited degrees of affinity (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+18:6-20">Leviticus 18:6-20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+20:10-21">20:10-21</A>). He and his descendants to the tenth generation are excluded from the assembly of the Lord. (See Driver, at the place). Zechariah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+9:6">Zechariah 9:6</A>), after prophesying the overthrow of three Philistine cities, declares of the fourth: "And a bastard (the Revised Version, margin "a bastard race") shall dwell in Ashdod," meaning probably that a "mixed population" (BDB) of aliens shall invade and settle in the capital of the Philistines. In Heb (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+12:8">Hebrews 12:8</A>) in its proper sense of "born out of wedlock," and therefore not admitted to the privileges of paternal care and responsibility as a legitimate son.
