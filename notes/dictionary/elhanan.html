            <P><B>ELHANAN</B><P> el-ha'-nan ('elchanan, "whom God gave"):
<P> (1) A great warrior in the army of David who slew a Philistine giant. There is a discrepancy between <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:19">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:19</A> and
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+20:5">1&nbsp;Chronicles 20:5</A>. In the former passage we read, "And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan, the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam"; while in the latter we are told, "And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam." Most modern critics prefer as the original text of the latter part of the two discrepant statements the following:
<P> "and Elhanan the son of Jair the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam." It is contended that the Chronicler slightly modified the text before him, in order to bring it into harmony with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17">1&nbsp;Samuel 17</A>, where David is said to have slain a Philistine giant Goliath. There is almost unanimous agreement that "Jaare-oregim" is a corrupt reading, and the "Jair" in 1Ch is to be preferred. From Jerome to the present some scholars identify Elhanan with David, and thus remove the discrepancy. Ewald ( Hist, III, 70) argued that the name "Goliath" was inserted in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17">1&nbsp;Samuel 17</A> and 21 by the narrators whose compositions are embodied in Samuel, Elhanan being the real victor over Goliath, while David's antagonist was simply called "the Philistine."
<P> (2) The son of Dodo of Bethlehem, one of David's mighty men (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:24">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:26</A>). Some moderns think that there was only one Elhanan, and that he was the son of Dodo of the clan of Jair.
