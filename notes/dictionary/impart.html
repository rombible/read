            <P><B>IMPART</B><P> im-part' (metadidomi, "to share"):
<P> "They .... imparted (the King James Version "added") nothing to me" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</A>); that is, did not propose any correction or addition to my teaching. "That I may impart unto you some spiritual gift" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</A>) expresses the apostle's hope that the Roman believers may increase in faith and love through his teaching and influence.
<P> "To impart unto you .... our own souls" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:8">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:8</A>) meant to spend their utmost strength and to expose their lives in their service.
