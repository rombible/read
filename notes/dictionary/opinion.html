            <P><B>OPINION</B><P> o-pin'-yun (dea`, ce`ippim):
<P> "Opinion" occurs only 5 times, thrice in Job (32:6,10,17) as the translation of dea`, "knowledge," "opinion" (in the address of Elihu), and once of ce`ippim, from ca`aph, "to divide or branch out," hence, division or party, unsettled opinion (in the memorable appeal of Elijah, "How long halt ye between two opinions?" <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+18:21">1&nbsp;Kings 18:21</A>, the American Standard Revised Version "How long go ye limping between the two sides?"). In Ecclesiasticus 3:24, we have, "For many are deceived by their own vain opinion" (hupolepsis, "a taking up," "a hasty judgment"), the Revised Version (British and American) The conceit of many hath led them astray.
<P> W. L. Walker
