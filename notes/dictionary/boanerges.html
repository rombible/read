            <P><B>BOANERGES</B><P> bo-a-nur'-jez (Boanerges; bene reghesh, "sons of thunder"):
<P> The surname bestowed by Jesus upon James and John, the sons of Zebedee, when they were ordained to the apostleship (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:17" target="_blank">Mark 3:17</A>). See <a href="james.html">JAMES</a>. It has also been regarded as an equivalent of the "Heavenly Twins," the Sons of Zeus or Thunder. According to this interpretation, the name Boanerges would represent the Dioscuri in some form or other of their varied presentation in the cults of the Mediterranean (compare Professor J. Rendel Harris in The Expositor, series vii, III, 146).
