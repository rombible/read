            <P><B>STING</B><P> sting (parash, "to cut into"; kentron, "a goad," "spur"):
<P> A sharp, pointed organ or instrument for inflicting wounds by puncture; sting of an adder, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+23:32">Proverbs 23:32</A>; of scorpions, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+9:10">Revelation 9:10</A>. In the free quotation of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:55">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:55</A> from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+13:14">Hosea 13:14</A>, death is personified as a deadly animal, like a scorpion or serpent, which inflicts destruction by means of sin as its kentron. It should also be remembered that in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</A> the same Greek word is used with reference to an instrument for exciting fear, rather than death. Both figures are pertinent; for death is powerless, except through sin, and, also, when sin is vanquished, the fear of death (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</A>) is gone.
<P> H. E. Jacobs
