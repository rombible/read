<P> Of Yahweh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+34:5">Exodus 34:5</A>); of the Spirit (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</A>); of angels (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+28:12">Genesis 28:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+28:2">Matthew 28:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:51">John 1:51</A>); of Christ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+4:16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:9">Ephesians 4:9</A>). "He also descended into the lower parts of the earth" is variously interpreted, the two chief interpretations being the one of the incarnation, and the other of the "descent into hell" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+3:19">1&nbsp;Peter 3:19</A>). The former regards the clause "of the earth," an appositive genitive, as when we speak of "the city of Rome," namely, "the lower parts, i.e. the earth." The other regards the genitive as possessive, or, with Meyer, as governed by the comparative, i.e. "parts lower than the earth." For the former view, see full discussion in Eadie; for the latter, Ellicott and especially Meyer, in commentaries on Eph.
