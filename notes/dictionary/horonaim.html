            <P><B>HORONAIM</B><P> hor-o-na'-im (~choronayim]; Aronieim; in Jeremiah Oronaim, "the two hollows"):
<P> an unidentified place in the South of Moab. It is named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:5">Jeremiah 48:5</A>. Isaiah (15:5) and Jeremiah (48:3) speak of "the way to Horanaim"; and Jeremiah (48:5) of the , "descent," or "going down" of Horonaim. Mesha (MS) says he was bidden by Chemosh to "go down" and fight against Choronem. Probably, therefore, it lay on one of the roads leading down from the Moabite plateau to the Arabah. It is mentioned by Josephus as having been taken by Alexander Janneus (Ant., XIII, xv, 4). Hyrcanus promised to restore it and the rest to Aretas (XIV, i, 4). There is no indication that in early times it was ever possessed by Israel. Buhl (GAP 272 f) thinks it may be represented by some significant ruins near Wady ed-Dera`a (Wady Kerak).
