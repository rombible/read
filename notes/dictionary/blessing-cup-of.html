            <P><B>BLESSING, CUP OF</B><P> (to poterion tes eulogias, "the consecrated cup," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+10:16">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:16</A>):
<P> A technical term from the Jewish liturgy transferred to the Lord's Supper, and signifying the cup of wine upon which a blessing was pronounced. The suggestion that it carries with it a higher significance, as a cup that brings blessing, is not without force. The succeeding words, "we bless," are equivalent to "for which we give thanks." It was consecrated by thanksgiving and prayer.
