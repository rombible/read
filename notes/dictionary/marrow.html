            <P><B>MARROW</B><P> mar'-o (moach, chelebh, shiqquy, machah, "to make fat," "to grease"; muelos):
<P> Marrow is the nourisher and strengthener of the bones; it is said to moisten the bones: "The marrow (moach) of his bones is moistened" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+21:24">Job 21:24</A>). The fear of Yahweh "will be health to thy navel, and marrow (shiqquy, margin "refreshing, Hebrew moistening") to thy bones" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+3:8">Proverbs 3:8</A>). Thus, the expression is used figuratively of the things which alone can satisfy the soul: "My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow (chelebh, "fat") and fatness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+63:5">Psalms 63:5</A>); "In this mountain will Yahweh of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow (memuchayim, particle, plural, Pual of machah), of wines on the lees well refined" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+25:6">Isaiah 25:6</A>). In the Epistle to the Hebrews the writer speaks of the word of God, which is "living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</A>).
