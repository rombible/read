            <P><B>DARE</B><P> dar:
<P> The expression "to dare" in the Scriptures never has the meaning of "to defy," "to challenge," or "to terrify." It is always found as the translation of tolmao, "to manifest courage." This is particularly evident from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+10:12">2&nbsp;Corinthians 10:12</A>, "for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves" (the King James Version "for we dare not make ourselves of the number").
