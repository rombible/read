            <P><B>FIT, FITLY</B><P> fit'-li:
<P> The word "fit" (adjective and verb) occurs a few times, representing nearly as many Hebrew and Greek words. the Revised Version (British and American) frequently alters, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+16:21">Leviticus 16:21</A> (`itti, "timely," "opportune," "ready"), where for "fit" it reads "in readiness," margin "appointed." In
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:11</A> the Revised Version (British and American) has "that were able"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+44:13">Isaiah 44:13</A>, "shapeth"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+24:27">Proverbs 24:27</A>, "ready," etc. "Fitly" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+25:11">Proverbs 25:11</A> is in the Revised Version, margin "in due season"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:12">Song of Solomon 5:12</A>, "fitly set" is in the Revised Version, margin "sitting by full streams." In the New Testament "fit" is the translation of euthetos, "well placed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+9:62">Luke 9:62</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+14:35">14:35</A>), of kathekon, "suitable" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+22:22">Acts 22:22</A>), and of katartizo, "to make quite ready" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</A>, "vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction").
