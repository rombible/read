            <P><B>HETH (2)</B><P> heth (cheth):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+23:10">Genesis 23:10</A> the ancestor of the Hittites. As the various peoples who occupied Canaan were thought to belong to one stock, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:15">Genesis 10:15</A> (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:13">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:13</A>) makes Heth the (2nd) son of Canaan. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+23">Genesis 23</A> the "sons of Heth" occupy Hebron, but they were known to have come there from the north. A reference to this seems to be preserved in the order of the names in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:15,16">Genesis 10:15,16</A>, where Heth is placed between Sidon and the Jebusites.
<P> See HITTITES.
