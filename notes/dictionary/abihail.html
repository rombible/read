<P> "father, or cause, of strength"): Five persons in the Old Testament are called by this name:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>A Levite and the father of Zuriel, who in the Wilderness was head of the house of Merari, Levi's youngest son (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:35">Numbers 3:35</A>);
<P>
<LI>The wife of Abishur, a man of the tribe of Judah, in the line of Hazron and Jerahmeel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:29">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:29</A>);
<P>
<LI>One of the heads of the tribe of Gad, who dwelt in Gilead of Bashan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:14">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:14</A>);
<P>
<LI>Either a wife of Rehoboam, king of Judah, or mother of his wife Mahalath, according to the interpretation of the text (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:18</A>); probably the latter view is correct, since there is no conjunction in the text, and since (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:19">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:19</A>) contemplates only one wife as already mentioned. This being true, she was the wife of Jerimath, a son of David, and daughter of Eliab, David's eldest brother. It is interesting to note this frequent intermarriage in the Davidic house;
<P>
<LI>Father of Queen Esther, who became wife of Xerxes (Biblical Ahasuerus) king of Persia, after the removal of the former queen, Vashti, (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+2:15">Esther 2:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+9:29">9:29</A>). He was uncle of Mordecai.
