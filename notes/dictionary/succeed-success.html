            <P><B>SUCCEED; SUCCESS</B><P> suk-sed', suk-ses' (yarash, sakhal; euemeria):
<P> "To succeed" means,
<P> (1) and originally, "to follow after";
<P> (2) mostly in modern English, "to prosper"; in the King James Version, with one exception, the word has a qualifying adjective.
<P> (1) In the first sense it is the translation of yarash, "to seize" or "to take possession" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+2:12">Deuteronomy 2:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+12:29">12:29</A>, the American Standard Revised Version "dispossessest," the English Revised Version "possessest"); of qum, "to rise up" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+25:6">Deuteronomy 25:6</A>, "shall succeed in the name of his brother"); of diadechomai (Ecclesiasticus 48:8, "prophets to succeed after him").
<P> (2) In the sense of prospering, "success" is the translation of sakhal, "to be wise," "to prosper" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+1:8">Joshua 1:8</A>, "Thou shalt have good success," the King James Version margin "do wisely," the Revised Version margin "deal wisely"; compare the King James Version margin <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+22:2">Job 22:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+111:10">Psalms 111:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+3:4">Proverbs 3:4</A>); "good success" occurs in Tobit 7:12, euodosei ta kallista; The Wisdom of Solomon 13:19, epituchia; Ecclesiasticus 20:9, euodia, the Revised Version (British and American) "prosperity," "There is a prosperity that a man findeth in misfortunes; and there is a gain that turneth to loss"; Ecclesiasticus 38:13, euodia (so Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Ephraemi--this word = "sweet savior," "fragrance"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+2:15">2&nbsp;Corinthians 2:15</A>). See further EUODIA. the Revised Version (British and American) "the issue for good" 1 Macc 4:55, euodoo; 8:23, kalos, etc. "Success," simply (as "prosperity," euemeria), 2 Macc 10:28, "a pledge of success and victory"; "successor" occurs (Ecclesiasticus 46:1, "Joshua .... was the successor diadochos of Moses"; 2 Macc 9:23; 14:26).
