<P> Mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:4">Genesis 10:4</A> as the eldest son of Javan, and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:7">Ezekiel 27:7</A> as the source from which the Tyrians obtained their purple dyes. On the ground of this latter statement attempts have been made to identify it with Southern Italy or the north of Africa. Josephus (Ant., I, vi, 1) identified Elisha with the Aeolians. The Targum on Ezekiel gives "the province of Italy." Other suggestions include Hellas, Ells, and Alsa; the last named is a kingdom mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Letters, but its precise location is unknown. It is impossible as yet to claim certainty for any of these conjectures.
