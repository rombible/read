About 110 B.C. it was taken from the Idumaeans by John Hyrcanus. It was in ruins in the fourth century, when Eusebius and Jerome describe it as in the second mile from Eleutheropolis. South-southwest of <I>Beitjibrin</I> --in all probability Eleutheropolis-and it little over a Roman mile therefrom is a site called <I>Marash</I> , which is possibly the representative of the ancient Mareshah. </FONT></body></html>
