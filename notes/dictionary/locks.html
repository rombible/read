<P> ((1) tsitsith,
<P> (2) pera';
<P> (3) machlaphah,
<P> (4) qewutstsah):
<P> See in general the article on HAIR.
<P> (1) The first word, tsitsith, means really a tassel, such as is worn by the Jews on the four corners of the prayer-shawl or Tallith and on the 'arba` kanephoth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+22:12">Deuteronomy 22:12</A>), translated in the New Testament by kraspedon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+9:20">Matthew 9:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+14:36">14:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:5">23:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+8:44">Luke 8:44</A>). Once it is applied to a forelock of hair. The prophet Ezekiel, describing his sensations which accompanied his vision of Jerusalem, says:
<P> "He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerus" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+8:3">Ezekiel 8:3</A>).
<P> (2) The word pera` signifies the uncut and disheveled locks of the Nazirite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+6:5">Numbers 6:5</A>) or of the priests, the sons of Zadok (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+44:20">Ezekiel 44:20</A>).
<P> (3) The Book of Judges employs the word machlaphah when speaking of the "seven locks" of Samson (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+16:13,19">Judges 16:13,19</A>), which really represent the plaited (etymologically, "interwoven") strands of hair still worn in our days by youthful Bedouin warriors.
<P> (4) Qewutstsah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:2,11">Song of Solomon 5:2,11</A>) means the luxuriant hair of the Hebrew youth, who was careful of his exterior. It is called bushy (the Revised Version margin "curling") and black as a raven. the King James Version translations also the word tsammah with "locks" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+4:1">Song of Solomon 4:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+6:7">6:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+47:2">Isaiah 47:2</A>), but the Revised Version (British and American) has corrected this into "veil," leaving the word "locks" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+4:1">Song of Solomon 4:1</A> margin.
