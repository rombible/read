            <P><B>SHAVING</B><P> shav'-ing (in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:20">Job 1:20</A>, gazaz, usually galach; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</A>, xurao):
<P> Customs as to shaving differ in different countries, and in ancient and modern times. Among the Egyptians it was customary to shave the whole body (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+41:14">Genesis 41:14</A>). With the Israelites, shaving the head was a sign of mourning (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+21:12">Deuteronomy 21:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:20">Job 1:20</A>); ordinarily the hair was allowed to grow long, and was only cut at intervals (compare Absalom, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+14:26">2&nbsp;Samuel 14:26</A>). Nazirites were forbidden to use a razor, but when their vow was expired, or if they were defiled, they were to shave the whole head (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+6:5,9,18">Numbers 6:5,9,18</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</A>). The shaving of the beard was not permitted to the Israelites; they were prohibited from shaving off even "the corner of their beard" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:5">Leviticus 21:5</A>). It was an unpardonable insult when Hanun, king of the Ammonites, cut off the half of the beards of the Israelites whom David had sent to him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+10:4">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+19:4">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:4</A>).
<P> Shaving "with a razor that is hired" is Isaiah's graphic figure to denote the complete devastation of Judah by the Assyrian army (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:20">Isaiah 7:20</A>).
