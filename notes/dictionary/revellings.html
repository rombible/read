            <P><B>REVELLINGS</B><P> rev'-el-ingz (komos):
<P> The word is found both in the King James Version and in the Revised Version (British and American) in The Wisdom of Solomon 14:23 (the Revised Version (British and American) "revels," orgiastic heathen worship is in point); 2 Macc 6:4; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:21">Galatians 5:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+4:3">1&nbsp;Peter 4:3</A>. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:21">Galatians 5:21</A> it is classed with fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, etc., as one of the works of the flesh. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+4:3">1&nbsp;Peter 4:3</A> it is spoken of the Gentiles and is classcd with drunkenness and carousings and such like. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</A> the Revised Version has "revelling" instead of the King James Version "rioting," and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:13">2&nbsp;Peter 2:13</A>, "revel" replaces "riot." Similarly in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+6:7">Amos 6:7</A>, "revelry" replaces "banquet." The obvious meaning of the word is excessive and boisterous intemperance and lustful indulgence.
