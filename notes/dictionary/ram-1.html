            <P><B>RAM (1)</B><P> ram (ram, "high," "exalted"):
<P> (1) An ancestor of David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+4:19">Ruth 4:19</A> (Arran); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+1:3,4">Matthew 1:3,4</A> (Aram); in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:9</A> he is called the "brother," but in 2:25, the "son of Jerahmeel" (compare 2:27). Ram as the son of Hezron appears more likely than Ram the son of Jerahmeel, since, according to the narratives of 1 and 2 Samuel, David cannot have been a Jerahmeelite.
<P> (2) Name of Elihu's family (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+32:2">Job 32:2</A>). It is an open question as to whether Ram should be taken as a purely fictitious name, invented by the author of the Elihu speeches, or whether it is that of some obscure Arab tribe. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+22:21">Genesis 22:21</A> Aram is a nephew of Buz (compare Elihu the Buzite), and the conjecture was at one time advanced that Ram was a contraction of Aram; but this theory is no longer held to be tenable. The suggestion that the initial "a" (the Hebrew letter, 'aleph) has been changed by a scribal error into "h" (the Hebrew letter, he) is more acceptable. Rashi, the rabbinical commentator, takes the quaint position that Ram is identical with Abraham.
