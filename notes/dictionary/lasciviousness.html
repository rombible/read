            <P><B>LASCIVIOUSNESS</B><P> la-siv'-i-us-nes (aselgeia, "licentiousness," "wantonness," "unbridled lust," "shamelessness," "outrageousness"):
<P> 1. Sources:
<P> Etymologists assign three probable sources of aselgeia, namely:
<P> (1) from a compound of the alpha privitive (negation) and Selge, a Pisidian city whose inhabitants according to Thayer (New Testament Lexicon) "excelled in strictness of morals," but, according to Trench, a place whose people "were infamous for their vices";
<P> (2) from a compound of "a" intense, and salagein, "to raise a disturbance or noise";
<P> (3) from a compound of the alpha privitive a- and selgo, or thelgo, "exciting disgust or displeasure." It evidently means conduct and character that is unbecoming, indecent, unrestrainedly shameless.
<P> 2. As Used in the New Testament:
<P> Mark uses it in 7:22 with uncertainty as to the vice meant. Paul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+12:21">2&nbsp;Corinthians 12:21</A>) classes it with uncleanness and fornication as sins to be repented of; also (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:19">Galatians 5:19</A>; compare The Wisdom of Solomon 14:26, "wantonness") puts it in the same catalogue with other works of the flesh; and (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:19">Ephesians 4:19</A>) he refers to some aged ones so covetous, that they made trade of themselves by giving "themselves up to lasciviousness." The same word is translated "wantonness" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</A>, meaning wanton manner, filthy words, unchaste movements of the body. Peter (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+4:3">1&nbsp;Peter 4:3</A>) mentions those who "walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries." He speaks (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:2">2&nbsp;Peter 2:2</A>) of "lascivious doings" (the King James Version "pernicious ways"); (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:7">2&nbsp;Peter 2:7</A>) "lascivious life" (the King James Version "filthy conversation"); and (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:18">2&nbsp;Peter 2:18</A>) of "lasciviousness" (the King James Version "wantonness"), as a means "to entice in the lusts of the flesh." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</A> probably does not refer to any form of sensuality in using the word descriptive of "ungodly men" who perverted the faith of some and denied our only Master.
