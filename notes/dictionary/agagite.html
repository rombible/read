            <P><B>AGAGITE</B><P> a'-gag-it, ('aghaghi, from, 'aghagh, "a member of the house of Agag"):
<P> A title of opprobrium given to Haman (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+3:1,10">Esther 3:1,10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+8:3,5">8:3,5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+9:24">9:24</A>). Jewish tradition always assigned the arch-enemies of Israel membership in the house of Amalek, the hereditary foe of the nation. Compare Ant, XI, vi, 5. The word Agag has properly been taken by Delitzsch as related to the Assyrian agagu, "to be powerful," "vehement," "angry." In the Greek parts of Esther, Haman is termed a Macedonian (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+1:2-6">Esther 1:2-6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+1:6-10">1:6-10</A>). The name Haman is probably of Elamitic origin. Oppert's attempt to connect the term "Agagite" with "Agaz," a Median tribe mentioned by Sargon, has found no supporters.
