            <P><B>SHEERAH</B><P> she'-e-ra (she'erah; Codex Alexandrinus Saara, Codex Vaticanus omits):
<P> A daughter of Ephraim, who, according to the Massoretic Text of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:24">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:24</A> (the King James Version "Sherah"), built the two Beth-horons and Uzzen-sheerah. The verse has been suspected because elsewhere in the Old Testament the founders of cities are men. Uzzen-sheerah as a place is unidentified; Conder suggests as the site Bet Sira, a village 2 miles Southwest of the Lower Beth-horon (Mem 3 16).
