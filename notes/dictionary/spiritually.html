<P> As in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+2:14">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:14</A>, "spiritually judged," i.e. by means of the spirit renewed and enlightened by the spirit of God; having the mind of the Spirit is to be spiritually-minded (compare the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</A>).
<P> Allegorically used also (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</A>) to characterize, in a bad sense, the qualities of the spiritual (i.e. the spirit's) life:
<P> "which spiritually is called Sodom."
<P> See SPIRITUAL.
