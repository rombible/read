            <P><B>PAW</B><P> po (kaph, literally, "palm," yadh, literally, "hand"):
<P> The former (kaph) is applied to the soft paws of animals in contradistinction to the hoofs (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:27">Leviticus 11:27</A>); the latter is thrice used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17:37">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:37</A>: "Yahweh that delivered me out of the paw (yadh) of the lion, and out of the paw (yadh) of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand (yadh) of this Philistine." The verb "to paw" (chaphar) is found in the description of the horse: "He paweth (margin "they paw") in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth out to meet the armed men (margin, "the weapons")" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:21">Job 39:21</A>). The word is usually translated "to delve into," "to pry into," "to explore."
