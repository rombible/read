            <P><B>JESTING</B><P> jest'-ing:
<P> Used from Tyndale down as the translation of eutrapelia (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</A>). Aristotle uses the original in his Ethics iv.14 as an equivalent of "quick-witted," from its root meaning "something easily turned," adding that, since the majority of people love excessive jesting, the word is apt to be degraded. This is the case here, where it clearly has a flavor of the coarse or licentious.
