            <P><B>GOODLY</B><P> good'-li Tobh; kalos, lampros):
<P> In the Old Testament various words are translated "goodly," the most of them occurring only once; Tobh (the common word for "good") is several times translated "goodly," chiefly in the sense of form or appearance e.g "a goodley child" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:2">Exodus 2:2</A>); "that goodly mountain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:25">Deuteronomy 3:25</A>); yapheh ("fair") is similarly translated in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+39:6">Genesis 39:6</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "comely," and mar'oh in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:21">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:21</A>. Other words, such as 'addir imply excellence, honor, etc., e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+17:23">Ezekiel 17:23</A>, "bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar"; hodh, "his goodly horse" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+10:3">Zechariah 10:3</A>); others imply beauty, ornament, such as peer "goodly bonnets," the Revised Version (British and American) "headtires" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:28">Exodus 39:28</A>); shaphar ("bright," "fair"), "a goodly heritage" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+16:6">Psalms 16:6</A>); once 'El ("God of might") is employed, the Revised Version (British and American) "cedars of God," margin "goodly cedars" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+80:10">Psalms 80:10</A>); renanim ("joyous soundings or shoutings") is translated in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:13">Job 39:13</A> "goodly wings," probably from the sound made in flying or flapping; the English Revised Version has "The wing of the ostrich rejoiceth," the American Standard Revised Version (wings) "wave proudly." For "goodly castles" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:10">Numbers 31:10</A>) the Revised Version (British and American) has "encampments"; "goodly vessels" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+32:27">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:27</A>) for "pleasant jewels"; "goodly" is substituted for "good" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+45:1">Psalms 45:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+1:3">Song of Solomon 1:3</A>); "goodly things" for "all the goods" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+24:10">Genesis 24:10</A>); "goodly frame," the American Standard Revised Version for "comely proportion" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:12">Job 41:12</A>).
<P> In the New Testament kalos ("beautiful") is translated "goodly" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:45">Matthew 13:45</A>, "goodly pearls" and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+21:5">Luke 21:5</A> "goodly stones"; lampros ("bright") in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+2:2">James 2:2</A>, "goodly apparel," the Revised Version (British and American) "fine clothing," and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+18:14">Revelation 18:14</A>, "dainty and goodly" the Revised Version (British and American) "dainty and sumptuous." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:23">Hebrews 11:23</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) ~bstitutes "goodly" for "proper."
<P> "Goodly" occurs in Apocrypha, 1 Esdras 4:18; Judith 8:7 (horaios); 2 Macc 9:16, "goodly gifts," kallistos, the Revised Version (British and American) "goodliest."
<P> W. L. Walker
