            <P><B>MERARI</B><P> me-ra'-ri (merari, "bitter"; Mararei):
<P> (1) The 3rd son of Levi, his brothers, Gershon and Kohath, being always mentioned together with him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+46:11">Genesis 46:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+6:16">Exodus 6:16</A>). He was among those 70 who went down to Egypt with Jacob (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+46:8,11">Genesis 46:8,11</A>; compare 46:26 and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+1:5">Exodus 1:5</A>).
<P> (2) The family of Merari, descendants of above, and always (with one exception, for which see MERARITES) spoken of as "sons of Merari" in numerous references, such as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:1,16,19,29">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:1,16,19,29</A>, which only repeat without additional information the references to be found in the body of this article. We early find them divided into two families, the Mahli and Mushi (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+6:19">Exodus 6:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:17,20,33">Numbers 3:17,20,33</A>). At the exodus they numbered, under their chief Zuriel, 6,200, and they were assigned the north side of the tabernacle as a tenting-place (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:34,35">Numbers 3:34,35</A>), thus sharing in the honor of those who immediately surrounded the tabernacle--the south side being given to the Kohathites, the west to the Gershonites, and the east--toward the sun-rising--being reserved for Moses, Aaron and his sons (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:23,29,35,38">Numbers 3:23,29,35,38</A>). To the Merarites was entrusted the care of the boards, bars, pillars, sockets, vessels, pins and cords of the tabernacle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:36,37">Numbers 3:36,37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:29-33">4:29-33</A>). They and the Gershonites were "under the hand" of Ithamar, son of Aaron, the sons of Gershon having charge of the softer material of the tabernacles --curtains, covers, hangings, etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:25,26">Numbers 3:25,26</A>). When reckoned by the number fit for service, i.e. between 30 and 50 years, the sons of Merari were 3,200 strong (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:42-45">Numbers 4:42-45</A>). Because of the weight of the material in their charge they were allowed 4 wagons and 8 oxen for carriage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+7:8">Numbers 7:8</A>). In marching, when the tabernacle was taken down, the standard of Judah went first (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:14">Numbers 10:14</A>); then followed the Merarites bearing the tabernacle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:17">Numbers 10:17</A>), and after them came the standard of Reuben (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:18">Numbers 10:18</A>). After the settlement in Canaan they had 12 cities assigned them out of Gad, Reuben and Zebulun (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:7,34-40">Joshua 21:7,34-40</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:63,77-81">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:63,77-81</A>), just as the other two branches of Levi's family had their 12 cities respectively assigned out of the other tribes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21">Joshua 21</A>). The names of these Merarite cities are given (loc. cit.), and among them is Ramoth-gilead, one of the cities of refuge (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:38">Joshua 21:38</A>). It is evident from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:44-47">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:44-47</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+16:41">16:41</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25:1,3,6,9,11,15,19,21">25:1,3,6,9,11,15,19,21</A>; compare 15:6,17-19 that they had charge under Ethan or Jeduthun of the temple music in the service. In David's time Asaiah was their chief (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:6">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:6</A>). Himself and 220 of the family helped David to bring up the Ark. David divided the Levites into courses among the Gershonites, Kohathites and Merarites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+23:6">1&nbsp;Chronicles 23:6</A>; compare 23:21-23; 24:26-30). The functions of certain Merarites are described in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:10-19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:10-19</A>. They also took part in cleansing the temple in Hezekiah's time (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:12</A>) as well as in the days of Josiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:12</A>), helping to repair the house of the Lord. Among the helpers of Ezra, too, we find some of them numbered (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:18,19">Ezra 8:18,19</A>). The family seems to have played a very important part in keeping steady and true such faithfulness as remained in Israel.
<P> (3) The father of Judith (Judith 8:1; 16:7).
