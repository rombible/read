            <P><B>SHIMRON (2)</B><P> (shimron; Codex Vaticanus Sumoon; Codex Alexandrinus Someron and other forms):
<P> A town whose king was tributary to Jabin king of Hazor, and who joined in the attempt to resist the invasion under Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+11:1">Joshua 11:1</A>). It was in the territory allotted to Zebulun (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:15">Joshua 19:15</A>). No sure identification is yet possible. The Septuagint and the Talmud both omit the "r" from the name; and Neubauer would identify it with Simonias (Vita, 24), the Simonia of the Talmud, which is now represented by Semuniyeh, a village about 5 miles West of Nazareth, on the edge of the plain (Geog. du Talm). Beit Lachm, named by Josephus along with it, is a short distance to the Northwest Es-Semeiriyeh, about 3 miles North of Acre, has also been suggested; but it is perhaps too far to the West.
