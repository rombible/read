            <P><B>EPHRON (2)</B><P> e'-fron (`ephron; Ephron):
<P> (1) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+13:19">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13:19</A>:
<P> "And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof." Another reading is "Ephraim" (Revised Version, margin). This is thought by many to be identical with Ophrah (`ophrah, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:23">Joshua 18:23</A>) and perhaps with Ephraim (`ephrayim, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:23">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:23</A>) which both have been localized at the lofty town of eT Taiyibeh.
<P> (2) A city East of the Jordan between Carnion (Ashteroth-karnain) and Scythopolis (Beisan):
<P> "Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the country. .... Now when they came unto Ephron (this was a great city in the way as they should go, very well fortified) they could not turn from it either on the right hand or on the left, but they must needs pass through the midst of it" (1 Macc 5:45,46 the King James Version; Ant, XII, viii, 5; also 2 Macc 12:27). Buhl and Schumacher propose Kacr Wady el Ghafr, a ruined tower which completely commands the deep Wady el Ghafr, but the ruins appear to be scanty.
<P> (3) Mt. Ephron:
<P> The border of Judah is described (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:9">Joshua 15:9</A>): "It went out to the cities of Mount Ephron." The position will depend on that of Nephtoah and of Kiriath-jearim.
