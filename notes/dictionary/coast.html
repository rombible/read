<P> "Coast" (from Latin costa, "rib" or "side") in the sense of "seacoast," occurs but a few times in the Bible. In nearly all the many passages where the King James Version has "coast," the Revised Version (British and American) correctly has "border," i.e. "boundary," translating gebhul, etc.; in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</A> the American Standard Revised Version, "coast" is the translation of topos, literally, "place." That the seacoast is but seldom mentioned arises naturally from the fact that, while the promised land extended to the sea, the coast was never effectively occupied by the Israelites. RVm in a number of places renders 'i English Versions of the Bible "isle" or "island" (which see), by "coastland," e.g.

In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+20:6">Isaiah 20:6</A>, the King James Version has "isle," the King James Version margin "country," and the Revised Version (British and American) "coast-land."
