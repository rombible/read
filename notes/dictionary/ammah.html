            <P><B>AMMAH</B><P> am'-a ('ammah, "mother" or "beginning"):
<P> A hill in the territory of Benjamin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+2:24">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:24</A>), where Joab and Abishai halted at nightfall in their pursuit of Abner and his forces after their victory over him in the battle of Gibeon. It "lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon"; but the exact location has not been identified. The same Hebrew word appears as the second part of Metheg-ammah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:1">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:1</A> the King James Version, but rendered "mother city" in the Revised Version (British and American), probably however not the same place as in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+2:24">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:24</A>.
