            <P><B>NAIOTH</B><P> na'-yoth, ni'-oth (nayoth; Codex Vaticanus Auath; Codex Alexandrinus Nauioth):
<P> This is the name given to a place in Ramah to which David went with Samuel when he fled and escaped from Saul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+19:18">1&nbsp;Samuel 19:18</A>, etc.). The term has often been taken as meaning "houses" or "habitations"; but this cannot be justified. There is no certainty as to exactly what the word signified. Clearly, however, it attached to a particular locality in Ramah; and whatever its etymological significance, it denoted a place where the prophets dwelt together. On approaching it in pursuit of David, Saul was overcome by the Spirit of God, and conducted himself like one "possessed," giving rise to the proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
