            <P><B>AIJALON</B><P> a'-ja-lon ('ayyalon, "deerplace"; the King James Version, Ajalon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:12">Joshua 10:12</A>)):
<P> (1) The name of a town allotted to the tribe of Da (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:42">Joshua 19:42</A>), which was also designated a Levitical city (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:24">Joshua 21:24</A>), which fell to the Sons of Kohath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:69">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:69</A>). The first mention of Aijalon is in the narrative of Joshua's defeat of the five Amorite kings:
<P> "thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:12">Joshua 10:12</A>). The Danites failed to take it from the Amorites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:35">Judges 1:35</A>), although the men of Ephraim held it in vassalage. Here Saul and Jonathan won a great victory over the Philistines (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:31">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:31</A>). At one time it was held by the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:13">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:13</A>). Rehoboam fortified it against the kingdom of Israel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:10</A>). In the days of King Ahaz it was captured by the Philistines (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+28:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:18</A>). It has been identified with the modern Yalo; its antiquity goes back to Tell el-Amarna Letters, in which it has mention. It Is situated Northwest of Jerusalem in a valley of the same name, which leads down from the mountains to the sea.
<P> (2) A town in the tribe of Zebulun, site unknown, where Elon the judge was buried (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+12:12">Judges 12:12</A>).
