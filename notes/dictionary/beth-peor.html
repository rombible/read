<P> "Over against Beth-peor" the Israelites were encamped, "beyond the Jordan, in the valley," when Moses uttered the speeches recorded in De (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:29">Deuteronomy 3:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+4:46">4:46</A>). "In the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor" Moses was buried (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+34:6">Deuteronomy 34:6</A>). Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah (the King James Version "Ashdoth-pisgah") are mentioned in close connection in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:20">Joshua 13:20</A>. According to Eusebius, Onomasticon, Beth-peor was situated near Mt. Peor (Fogor) opposite Jericho, 6 miles above Livias. Mt. Peor is the "top" or "head" of Peor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+23:28">Numbers 23:28</A>). Some height commanding a view of the plain East of the river in the lower Jordan valley is clearly intended, but thus far no identification is possible. "The slopes of Pisgah" are probably the lower slopes of the mountain toward Wady `Ayun Musa. Somewhere North of this the summit we are in search of may be found. Conder suggested the cliff at Minyeh, South of Wady Jedeideh, and of Pisgah; and would locate Beth-peor at el-Mareighat, "the smeared things," evidently an ancient place of worship, with a stone circle and standing stones, about 4 miles East, on the same ridge. This seems, however, too far South, and more difficult to reach from Shittim than we should gather from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:1">Numbers 25:1</A>.
