            <P><B>BROAD</B><P> brod (rochabh, "width"; rechobh, "a broadway," "street," "court"; eurchoros, "spacious"):
<P> Occurs frequently as a term of dimension (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:1">Exodus 27:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:6">1&nbsp;Kings 6:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:6,43">Ezekiel 40:6,43</A> the Revised Version (British and American), "handbreadth long") and as indicative of strength (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:8">Nehemiah 3:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+51:58">Jeremiah 51:58</A>). The centers of communal life are called the "broad places," often rendered "streets" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+5:1">Jeremiah 5:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+3:2">Song of Solomon 3:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=na+2:4">Nahum 2:4</A>). A court before the temple: "the broad place on the east" (the King James Version "the east street," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:4">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:4</A>); "broad plates" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+16:38,39">Numbers 16:38,39</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "beaten").
<P> Figurative:
<P> Relief from distress: "Yea, he would have allured thee out of (Hebrew "the mouth of") distress into a broad place" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+36:16">Job 36:16</A>); the liberty of obedience or liberty within the law (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+119:96">Psalms 119:96</A>, "broad," "roomy," "at liberty"); the all-sufficiency of God for His people (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+33:21">Isaiah 33:21</A>). Jerusalem could not boast of a river or navy--Yahweh's presence with and within her would more than supply these deficiencies; the road to destruction: "Broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+7:13">Matthew 7:13</A>); the ostentatious piety of the Pharisees: "They make broad (platuno, "widen") their phylacteries" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:5">Matthew 23:5</A>).
