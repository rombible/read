<P> Mishneh"): A part of Jerusalem, apparently not far from the FISH GATE (which see) and the MAKTESH (which see). The translation "college" is due to Targum of Jonathan on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+22:14">2&nbsp;Kings 22:14</A>. The Revised Version (British and American) interpretation of Mishneh is connected with the belief that Hezekiah, when he built "the other wall without" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+32:5">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:5</A>), made the second wall on the North. There seems little evidence of this (see JERUSALEM, VI, 11), and the "second" may refer to the district of the city on the west hill or perhaps to the hill itself.
<P> See COLLEGE.
