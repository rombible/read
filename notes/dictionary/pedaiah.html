            <P><B>PEDAIAH</B><P> pe-da'-ya, pe-di'-a (pedhayahu, "Yah redeems"):
<P> (1) Father of Joel, who was ruler of Western Manasseh in David's reign (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:20">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:20</A>). Form pedhayah (see above).
<P> (2) Pedaiah of Rumah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:36">2&nbsp;Kings 23:36</A>), father of Zebudah, Jehoiakim's mother.
<P> (3) A son of Jeconiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:18">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:18</A>); in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:19</A> the father of Zerubbabel. Pedaiah's brother, Shealtiel, is also called father of Zerubbabel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+3:2">Ezra 3:2</A>; but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:17</A> the King James Version spelled "Salathiel"). There may have been two cousins, or even different individuals may be referred to under Shealtiel and Salathiel respectively.
<P> (4) Another who helped to repair the city wall (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:25">Nehemiah 3:25</A>), of the family of PAROSH (which see). Perhaps this is the man who stood by Ezra at the reading of the Law (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:4">Nehemiah 8:4</A>; 1 Esdras 9:44, called "Phaldeus").
<P> (5) A "Levite," appointed one of the treasurers over the "treasuries" of the Lord's house (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+13:13">Nehemiah 13:13</A>).
<P> (6) A Benjamite, one of the rulers residing in Jerusalem under the "return" arrangements (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:7">Nehemiah 11:7</A>).
<P> Henry Wallace
