            <P><B>NUTS</B><P> nuts:
<P> (1) ('eghoz; karua; Arabic jauz, "the walnut" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+6:11">Song of Solomon 6:11</A>)):
<P> This is certainly the walnut tree, Juglans regia, a native of Persia and the Himalayas which flourishes under favorable conditions in all parts of Palestine; particularly in the mountains. In such situations it attains the height of from 60 to 90 ft. A grove of such trees affords the most delightful shade.
<P> (2) (boTnim; terebinthoi (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+43:11">Genesis 43:11</A>, margin "pistachio nuts")):
<P> The Hebrew is perhaps allied to the Arabic buTm, the "terebinth," which is closely allied to the Pistacia vera, Natural Order Anacardiaceae, which produces pistachio nuts. These nuts, known in Arabic as fistuq, are prime favorites with the people of Palestine. They are oblong, 3/4 inches long, with green, oily cotyledons. They are eaten raw and are also made into various sweets and confectionery. They are a product of Palestine, very likely to be sent as a present to Egypt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+43:11">Genesis 43:11</A>).
