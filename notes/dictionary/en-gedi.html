            <P><B>EN-GEDI</B><P> en'-ge-di, en-ge'-di (`en gedhi, "fountain of the kid"):
<P> Identical with the present Ain Jidi. According to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+20:2">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:2</A> it is the same as Hazazon-tamar, mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:7">Genesis 14:7</A> as occupied by the Amorites and as having been attacked by Chedorlaomer after leaving Kadesh and El Paran on his way to the Vale of Siddim. The place is situated upon the West shore of the Dead Sea about midway between the North and the South ends, and was included in the territory of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:62">Joshua 15:62</A>). The spot is rendered attractive by the verdure clothing it by reason of immense fountains of warm water, 80 degrees F., which pour out from beneath the limestone cliffs.
<P> In the time of Solomon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+1:14">Song of Solomon 1:14</A>) palms and vines were cultivated here. Josephus also mentions its beautiful palm groves.
<P> In the time of Eusebius it was still a place of importance, but since the Middle Ages it has been almost deserted, being occupied now only by a few Arabs. The oasis occupies a small area a few hundred feet above the Dead Sea marked by the 650 ft. sedimentary terrace heretofore described (see <a href="dead-sea-the.html" target="_blank">DEAD SEA</a>). The limestone borders rise so abruptly to a height of 2,000 ft. immediately on the West, that the place can be approached only by a rock-cut path. Two streams, Wady Sugeir and Wady el- Areyeh, descend on either side through precipitous rocky gorges from the uninhabitable wilderness separating it from Bethlehem and Hebron. It was in the caves opening out from the sides of these gorges that David took refuge from Saul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+24:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 24:1</A>). During the reign of Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+20:2">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:2</A>), the children of Ammon, Moab and Mt. Seir attempted to invade Judah by way of En-gedi, but were easily defeated as they came up from the gorges to occupy the advantageous field of battle chosen by Jehoshaphat.
