            <P><B>LIBERAL; LIBERALITY; LIBERALLY</B><P> lib'-er-al, lib-er-al'-i-ti, lib'-er-al-i:
<P> The different forms of the word all refer to one who is generous, bountiful, willing and ready to give and to help. Both the Hebrew words of the Old Testament and the Greek words of the New Testament translated into the English word "liberal" have a deeper and nobler meaning than is generally conveyed by the English word. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+11:25">Proverbs 11:25</A>, the liberal soul (nephesh berakhah) means a soul that carries a blessing. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+32:5">Isaiah 32:5</A>, the American Standard Revised Version has "bountiful" where the King James Version has "liberal," and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+32:8">Isaiah 32:8</A> "noble" takes the place of "liberal" (nadhibh). The principal Greek words are haplotes literally, "simplicity," "sincerity," and charis, "grace," "favor." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:3">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:3</A>, "bounty" substitutes "liberality." It is well to bear in mind that a Biblical liberality can spring only out of a noble soul, and is Godlike in its genesis and spirit.
