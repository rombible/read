            <P><B>JERUBBAAL</B><P> jer-u-ba'-al, je-rub'-a-al (yerubba`al, "let Baal contend"):
<P> The name given to Gideon by his father, Joash, and the people in recognition of his destruction of the altar of Baal at Ophrah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+6:32">Judges 6:32</A>). For this name the form "Jerubbesheth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+1:21">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:21</A>) was substituted after the analogy of "Ishbosheth" and "Mephibosheth," in which bosheth, the Hebrew word for "shame," displaced the word ba`al, no doubt because the name resembled one given in honor of Baal.
<P> See GIDEON.
