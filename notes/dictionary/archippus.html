            <P><B>ARCHIPPUS</B><P> ar-kip'-us (Archippos):
<P> Addressed by Paul in his letter to Philem, as "our fellow-soldier"; probably a member of Philem's family circle, holding some official position in the church (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+4:17" target="_blank">Colossians 4:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</A>). See <a href="apphia.html">APPHIA</a>. The tradition that he was one of the seventy disciples, became bishop of Laodicea and later became a martyr, seems to have little historical foundation.
