Many scholars, according to McClintock and Strongs "Cyclopedia," consider that the Greek <I>aspalax</I> is the animal intended by both the words translated mole. It is not the European mole, but is a kind of blind mole-rat, from 8 to 12 inches long, feeding on vegetables, and burrowing like a mole, but on a larger scale. It is very common in Russia, and Hasselquiest says it is abundant on the plains of Sharon in Palestine. --ED.) </OL></FONT></body></html>
