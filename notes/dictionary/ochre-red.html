            <P><B>OCHRE, RED</B><P> o'-ker, (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+44:13">Isaiah 44:13</A>, "He marketh it out with a pencil," margin "red ochre," the King James Version "line"; seredh, a word found only here, and of unknown etymology):
<P> Designates the implement used by the carpenter to mark the wood after measuring and before cutting. "Red ochre" supposes this to have been a crayon (as does "pencil"), but a scratch-awl is quite as likely. Ochre is clay colored by an iron compound.
