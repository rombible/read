            <P><B>GITTAIM</B><P> git'-a-im (gittayim):
<P> The town to which the Beerothites tied, and where they lived as gerim, or protected strangers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+4:3">2&nbsp;Samuel 4:3</A>). The place need not have been beyond the boundaries of Benjamin, so it may be identical with Gittaim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:33">Nehemiah 11:33</A>, which was occupied by Benjamites after the exile. It is named with Hazor and Ramah; but so far the site has not been discovered.
