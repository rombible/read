            <P><B>MEMUCAN</B><P> me-mu'-kan (memukhan; derivation unknown but probably of Persian origin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+1:14,16,21">Esther 1:14,16,21</A>)):
<P> One of "the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom." Ahasuerus consults these men, as those "that knew law and judgment," as to the proper treatment of the rebellious Vashti. Memucan is the spokesman of the reply. He recommends Vashti's deposition so that "all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small." This advice is adopted and incorporated into a royal decree--with what success is not said.
