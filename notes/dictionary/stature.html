            <P><B>STATURE</B><P> stat'-ur (madh, middah, "measure" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+13:32">Numbers 13:32</A>, etc.), qomah, "standing up" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+16:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 16:7</A>, etc.); helikia, "greatness"):
<P> This last word means "height of the body," "stature," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:3">19:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</A>, but it can mean "length of life" equally well and has this force in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+9:21,23">John 9:21,23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:11">Hebrews 11:11</A>. And this meaning, not "stature" (as in the King James Version), is fixed for <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:27">Matthew 6:27</A> parallel <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:25">Luke 12:25</A>, for to add some 18 inches (see CUBIT) to one's "stature" would be a grotesque feat, while it is the smallness of the act that is emphasized. Hence, the translation "able to extend his long path of life by a single cubit" (the Revised Version (British and American) "measure of life"). Compare also "great of stature" Baruch 3:26 (eumegethes).
