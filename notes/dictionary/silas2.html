He first appears as one of the leaders of the church at Jerusalem ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-22.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-22.html">Acts 15:22</a> ) holding the office of an inspired teacher. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-32.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-32.html">Acts 15:32</a> ) His name, derived from the Latin <I>silva</I> , "wood," betokens him a Hellenistic Jew, and he appears to have been a Roman citizen. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/16-37.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/16-37.html">Acts 16:37</a> ) He was appointed as a delegate to accompany Paul and Barnabas on their return to Antioch with the decree of the Council of Jerusalem. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-22.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-22.html">Acts 15:22</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-32.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-32.html">Acts 15:32</a> ) Having accomplished this mission, he returned to Jerusalem. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-33.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-33.html">Acts 15:33</a> ) He must, however, have immediately revisited Antioch, for we find him selected by St. Paul as the companion of his second missionary journey. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-40.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-40.html">Acts 15:40</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/17-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/17-10.html">Acts 17:10</a> ) At Berea he was left behind with Timothy while St. Paul proceeded to Athens, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/17-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/17-14.html">Acts 17:14</a> ) and we hear nothing more of his movements until he rejoined the apostle at Corinth. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-5.html">Acts 18:5</a> ) His presence at Corinth is several times noticed. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/1-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/1-19.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:19</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-thessalonians/1-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-thessalonians/1-1.html">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-thessalonians/1-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-thessalonians/1-1.html">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:1</a> ) Whether he was the Silvanus who conveyed St. Peters first epistle to Asia Minor, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-peter/5-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-peter/5-12.html">1&nbsp;Peter 5:12</a> ) is doubtful the probabilities are in favor of the identity. A tradition of very slight authority represents Silas to have become bishop of Corinth. </FONT></body></html>
