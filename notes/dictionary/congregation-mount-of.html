            <P><B>CONGREGATION, MOUNT OF</B><P> (har-mo`edh <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+14:13">Isaiah 14:13</A>):
<P> The prophet has depicted the excitement caused in Sheol by the descent of the once mighty king of Babylon into the world of shades, and now himself points the contrast between the monarch's former haughty boastings and his present weak and hopeless condition: "Thou saidst in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north." Instead he is brought down "to the uttermost parts of the pit" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+14:15">Isaiah 14:15</A>). By the "mount of congregation" (meeting or assembly) is evidently meant the fancied Olympus of the gods on some lofty northern height. The king vaunted that he would make his abode with the gods in heaven; now he is cast down to the depths of Sheol.
<P> James Orr
