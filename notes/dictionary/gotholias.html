            <P><B>GOTHOLIAS</B><P> goth-o-li'-as (Gotholias):
<P> Father of Josias, one of the sons of Elam who returned from Babylon with Ezra (1 Esdras 8:33). The name corresponds to Athaliah, the Greek Gotholias being substituted for the Hebrew guttural `ayin, as in Gomorrah, Gaza, etc. Taken with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+11:1">2&nbsp;Kings 11:1</A>, the name would seem to have been used for both men and women.
