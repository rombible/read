            <P><B>ANDRONICUS</B><P> an-dro-ni'-kus (Andronikos):
<P> (1) A deputy of Antiochus Epiphanes, who, while ruling at Antioch, excited the Jews by the murder of Onias, and, upon their formal complaint, was executed by his superior (2 Macc 4:32-38); generally distinguished from another officer of the same name, also under Antiochus (2 Macc 5:23).
<P> (2) A kinsman of Paul, residing at Rome (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</A>). He had been converted to Christianity before Paul, and, like Paul, had suffered imprisonment, although when and where can only be surmised. When he and Junias, another kinsman of Paul, are referred to as "of note among the apostles," this may be interpreted as either designating the high esteem in which they were held by the Twelve, or as reckoning them in the number of apostles. The latter is the sense, if "apostle" be understood here in the more general meaning, used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</A> of Barnabas, in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+8:23">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:23</A> of Titus, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</A> of Epaphroditus, and in the Didache of "the traveling evangelists or missionaries who preached the gospel from place to place" (Schaff, The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, 67; see also Lightfoot on Philippians, 196). On this assumption, Andronicus was one of the most prominent and successful of the traveling missionaries of the early church.
