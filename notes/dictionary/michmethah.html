            <P><B>MICHMETHAH</B><P> mik'-me-tha (ha-mikhmethah; Codex Vaticanus Hikasmon; Codex Alexandrinus Machthoth):
<P> A place named in defining the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+16:6">Joshua 16:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+17:7">17:7</A>). It is said to lie "before," i.e. to the East of Shechem. In the name itself, the meaning of which is obscure, there is nothing to guide us. The presence of the article, however ("the Michmethah"), suggests that it may not be a proper name, but an appellative, applying to some feature of the landscape. Condor suggests the plain of Makhneh, which lies to the East of Nablus (Shechem), in which there may possibly be an echo of the ancient name.
