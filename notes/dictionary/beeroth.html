            <P><B>BEEROTH</B><P> be-e'-roth, be'-er-oth (be'eroth; Beroth):
<P> One of the cities of the Canaanites whose inhabitants succeeded in deceiving Israel, and in making a covenant with them (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+9:3">Joshua 9:3</A>). Apparently they were Hivites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+9:7">Joshua 9:7</A>). The occasion on which the Beerothites fled to Gittaim where they preserved their communal identity is not indicated. The town was reckoned to Benjamin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+4:2">2&nbsp;Samuel 4:2</A>). Eusebius, Onomasticon places it under Gibeon, 7 Roman miles from Jerusalem on the way to Nicopolis (Amwas). If we follow the old road by way of Gibeon (el-Jib) and Bethhoron, Beeroth would lie probably to the Northwest of el-Jib. The traditional identification is with el-Bireh, about 8 miles from Jerusalem on the great north road. If the order in which the towns are mentioned (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+9:17">Joshua 9:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:25">18:25</A>) is any guide as to position, el-Bireh is too far to the Northwest. The identification is precarious. To Beeroth belonged the murderers of Ish-bosheth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+4:2">2&nbsp;Samuel 4:2</A>), and Naharai, Joab's armor- bearer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:37">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:39">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:39</A>). It was reoccupied after the Exile (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:25">Ezra 2:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:29">Nehemiah 7:29</A>).
