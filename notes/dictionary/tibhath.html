            <P><B>TIBHATH</B><P> tib'-hath (tibhchath; Metabechas, Codex Alexandrinus Matebeth; Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) Thebath; Peshitta Tebhach):
<P> A city of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, from which David took much of the brass used later by Solomon in the construction of the temple-furnishings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+18:8">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:8</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:8">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:8</A> we must for the beTach of the Massoretic Text read with the Syriac Tebhach. It may be the same as the Tubihi of the Tell el-Amarna Letters; the Dibhu of the Karnak lists; and the Tubihi mentioned with Kadesh on the Orontes in the "Travels of an Egyptian" in the reign of Rameses II. The site is unknown, but it must have been on the eastern slopes of Anti-Lebanon, between which and the Euphrates we must locate Hadadezer's kingdom of Zobah. "Tebah" occurs also as an Aramaic personal or tribal name in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+22:24">Genesis 22:24</A>.
