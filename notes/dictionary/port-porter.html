            <P><B>PORT; PORTER</B><P> port, por'-ter:
<P> "Port" in the sense of "gate" (of a city or building) is obsolete in modern English, and even in the King James Version is found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+2:13">Nehemiah 2:13</A>. "Porter," as "gate-keeper," however, is still in some use, but "porter" now (but never in the English Versions of the Bible) generally means a burden-carrier. In the Old Testament, except in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:26">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+7:10,11">2&nbsp;Kings 7:10,11</A>, the porter (sho`er) is a sacred officer of the temple or tabernacle, belonging to a particular family of the Levites, with a share in the sacred dues (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+13:5">Nehemiah 13:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:47">12:47</A>). The "porters" are mentioned only in Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, and Chronicles has a special interest in them, relating that their duties were settled as far back as the time of David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:1-19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:1-19</A>), and that the office extended further to the first settlement of Palestine and even to Moses' day (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:17-26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:17-26</A>). The office was evidently one of some dignity, and the "chief-porters" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:26</A>) were important persons. For some inscrutable reason the Revised Version (British and American) renders sho`er by "doorkeeper" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15-26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15-26</A>, but not elsewhere.
