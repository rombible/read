            <P><B>RASSES</B><P> ras'-ez (Rhaasseis, Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Vaticanus, Rhasseis; Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) Tharsis; Old Latin Thiras et Rasis):
<P> The children of Rasses are mentioned with Put, Lud and the children of Ishmael as having been subdued by Holofernes (Judith 2:23).
<P> Their identity is a matter of conjecture only. Some think Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) Tharsis (= Tarsus) is meant, others Rosh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+38:2,3">Ezekiel 38:2,3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+39:1">39:1</A>), others Rhosos, a mountain range and city South from Anunus, on the Gulf of Issus. Most probably a district, not a town, is named, situated in the eastern part of Asia Minor.
<P> S. F. Hunter
