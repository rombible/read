            <P><B>WREST</B><P> rest:
<P> Found in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) 3 times in the writings of Moses, namely, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+23:2,6">Exodus 23:2,6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+16:19">Deuteronomy 16:19</A>. In all three places it refers to twisting, or turning aside, or perverting judgment or justice. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:17">Deuteronomy 24:17</A> the Revised Version (British and American) has "wrest" where the King James Version has "pervert."
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+56:5">Psalms 56:5</A> ('atsabh); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+3:16">2&nbsp;Peter 3:16</A> (strebloo), it refers to the word or words of God in the Scriptures. In the Psalms the servant of God, who speaks in God's name, complains that the enemies "wrest," misinterpret, misapply and pervert his words. In Peter it is the ignorant and unstedfast who so pervert and misuse some of the difficult words of Paul, and they do it to their own destruction--a most earnest warning against carelessness and conscienceless indifference in interpreting Scripture.
<P> G. H. Gerberding
