            <P><B>FILTH; FILTHINESS; FILTHY</B><P> filth, fil'-thi-nes, fil'-thi (tso'ah, Tum'ah; rhupoo):
<P> The word once translated "filth" in the Old Testament is tso'ah, "excrement" or "dung," elsewhere translated "dung" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+4:4">Isaiah 4:4</A>, used figuratively of evil doings, sin, "the filth of the daughters of Zion"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:12">Proverbs 30:12</A>); in the New Testament we have perikatharma "cleansings" "sweepings," offscourings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+4:13">1&nbsp;Corinthians 4:13</A>, "We are made as the filth of the world," the Revised Version, margin "or refuse"); rhupos, "filth," "dirt," Septuagint for tso'ah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+4:4">Isaiah 4:4</A> (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+3:21">1&nbsp;Peter 3:21</A>, "the filth of the flesh").
<P> "Filthiness" is the translation of tum'ah, "uncleanness" (ritual, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+5:3">Leviticus 5:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+7:20">7:20</A>, etc.), used figuratively of moral impurity, translated "filthiness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+6:21">Ezra 6:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+1:9">Lamentations 1:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+22:15">Ezekiel 22:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+24:11,13">24:11,13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+36:25">36:25</A>); niddah, "impurity" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:5">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:5</A>); figuratively (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+9:11">Ezra 9:11</A>); the Revised Version (British and American) has "uncleanness," but "filthiness" for uncleanness at close of verse (niddah); nechosheth, "brass," figuratively (for "impurity" or "impudence") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+16:36">Ezekiel 16:36</A>); aischrotes, primarily "ugliness," tropical for unbecomingness, indecency (only <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</A>, "nor filthiness, nor foolish talking"; Alford has "obscenity," Weymouth, "shameful"); akathartes, "uncleanness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</A> the King James Version), corrected text, ta akatharta, "the unclean things," so the Revised Version (British and American).
<P> "Filthy" is the translation of 'alach, "to be turbid," to become foul or corrupt in a moral sense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+15:16">Job 15:16</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+14:3">Psalms 14:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+53:3">53:3</A>); `iddim, plural of `iddah, from `adhadh, "to number or compute (monthly courses)"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+64:6">Isaiah 64:6</A>, "All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags," the Revised Version (British and American) "as a polluted garment"; compare
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+36:17">Ezekiel 36:17</A>; aischros, "ugly," tropical for unbecoming, shameful (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</A>, "for filthy lucre's sake"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</A>); shameful discourse aischrologia (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</A> the King James Version); rhupoo, "filthy," in a moral sense polluted (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+22:11">Revelation 22:11</A>, "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still," the Revised Version (British and American) "let him be made filthy still" (corrected text), margin "yet more"; Alford, "Let the filthy (morally polluted) pollute himself still" (in the constant middle sense of passive verbs when the act depends on the man's self)).
<P> In Apocrypha we have (Ecclesiasticus 22:1):
<P> "A slothful man is compared to a filthy (ardaloo) stone," the Revised Version (British and American) "a stone that is defiled," 22:2 "A slothful man is compared to the filth (bolbiton) of a dunghill"; 27:4 "So the filth (skubalon) of a man in his talk (the Revised Version (British and American) "of man in his reasoning") remaineth."
