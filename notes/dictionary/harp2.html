Moses assigns its invention to Jubal during the antediluvian period. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/4-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/4-21.html">Genesis 4:21</a> ) Josephus records that the harp had ten strings, and that it was played on with the plectrum. Sometimes it was smaller having only eight strings, and was usually played with the fingers. </FONT></body></html>
