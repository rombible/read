            <P><B>SANSANNAH</B><P> san-san'-a (cancannah; [Sansanna], or Sethennak):
<P> One of the uttermost cities in the Negeb of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:31">Joshua 15:31</A>), identical with Hazar-susah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:5">Joshua 19:5</A>), one of the cities of Simeon, and almost certainly the same as Hazar-susim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:31">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:31</A>). It cannot be said to have been identified with any certainty, though Simsim, "a good-sized village with well and pool, surrounded by gardens and having a grove of olives to the north," has been suggested (PEF, III, 260, Sh XX).
