            <P><B>SHIKKERON</B><P> shik'-er-on (shikkeron; the King James Version Shicron):
<P> A place mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:11">Joshua 15:11</A> as being on the northern border of Judah, between Ekron and Baalah, Jabneel being beyond, toward the sea. The site is unknown, but Rev. C. Hauser (PEFS, 1907, 289) suggests Tell es-Sellakeh, Northwest of `Akir, remarking that if this were the site the boundary would follow a natural course over the mountain to Jabneel.
