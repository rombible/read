            <P><B>ADVICE; ADVISE; ADVISEMENT</B><P> ad-vis', ad-viz', ad-viz'-ment:
<P> Aside from their regular meaning these words are peculiarly employed as follows:
<P> (1) Advice' In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+19:43">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:43</A> (from, dabhar, "word") the meaning is equal to "request" (the Revised Version, margin "were we not the first to speak of bringing back"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25:33">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:33</A> the King James Version (from, Ta`am, "taste," "reason") "advice" is equal to "sagacity" (the Revised Version (British and American) "blessed be thy discretion"). In
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+25:17">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:17</A> (from ya`ac, "to give or take counsel") the meaning seems to be "to consult with oneself"; compare also
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+19:30">Judges 19:30</A> the King James Version (the Revised Version (British and American) "take counsel").
<P> (2) Advise:
<P> In
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+24:13">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:13</A> the King James Version (from yadha, "to know") "to advise" means "to advise oneself," i.e. "to consider" (the Revised Version (British and American) "advise thee") Compare also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+21:12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 21:12</A> the King James Version (the Revised Version (British and American) "consider" from, ra'ah, "to see") and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+13:10">Proverbs 13:10</A> where "well- advised" is the same as "considerate" (from ya`ac; see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+25:17">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:17</A>).
<P> (3) Advisement (antiquated):
<P> Found once in the Old Testament in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:19</A> (from `etsah, "counsel"), where "upon advisement" means "upon deliberation." Compare  2Macc 14:20 the King James Version (the Revised Version (British and American) "when these proposals had been long considered").
