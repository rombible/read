            <P><B>HACHILAH, HILL OF</B><P> ha-ki'-la, hak'-i-la, (chakhilah):
<P> A hill in the wilderness of Judah, associated with the wanderings of David. It is stated (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+23:19">1&nbsp;Samuel 23:19</A>) to be "on the South of the desert" (or Jeshimon), and (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+26:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 26:1</A>) to be "before (on the front (i.e. edge) of) the desert." It was near Ziph and Maon. The only plausible hypothesis is that it is represented by the ridge Dhahret el-Kolah in the wilderness of Ziph, toward the desert of En-gedi (PEF, III, 313, Sh XXI).
