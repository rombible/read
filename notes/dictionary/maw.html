            <P><B>MAW</B><P> mo (qebhah (compare qobhah, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:8">Numbers 25:8</A>), keres; Septuagint enustron):
<P> The first word means the maw or stomach of ruminants. It is derived from a root designating "hollowed out." It is mentioned alongside of the shoulder and the two cheeks of ox and sheep, which are the priest's share of any sacrifice brought by Israelites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+18:3">Deuteronomy 18:3</A>). Septuagint, where enustron corresponds to Attic enustron, denotes the fourth stomach or abomasum, which was considered as a delicacy, and was almost a national dish of the Athenians, just as tripe is of the Londoners. The parallel form qobhah is used for the body of a woman, which is being transfixed by a spear thrust in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:8">Numbers 25:8</A>. The last word keres is found in a metaphorical sense: "(Nebuchadrezzar) hath, like a monster, swallowed me up, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+51:34">Jeremiah 51:34</A>).
