            <P><B>TRAIN; TRAINED</B><P> tran, trand:
<P> The word is used in two places in both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American), namely, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:14">Genesis 14:14</A>, where it means "drilled," "prepared for war," and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+22:6">Proverbs 22:6</A>. "Train up a child" means more than to teach, and includes everything that pertains to the proper development of the child, especially in its moral and spiritual nature. In this broader sense also the Revised Version (British and American) substitutes "train" for the "teach" of the King James Version in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+2:4">Titus 2:4</A> (sophronizo).
