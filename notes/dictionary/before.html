To be "before" God is to enjoy His favor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+31:22">Psalms 31:22</A>). "The Syrians before" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+9:12">Isaiah 9:12</A> the Revised Version, margin "on the east," as "behind," owing to the position of Canaan, relative to Syria, implies the west).
