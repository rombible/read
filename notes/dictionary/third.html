<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+19:24">Isaiah 19:24</A>, "In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria," etc., brings out very distinctly the universal and missionary character of Isaiah's prophecies and of Israel's destiny (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+16:63">Ezekiel 16:63</A>; and see G. A. Smith, Isaiah, II, 275, 278; Watkinson, Th. Blind Spot 21).
