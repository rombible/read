Supposing that the translation is correct, the meaning of the word is <I>peaceable</I> or <I>pacific</I> , and the allusion is either to Solomon, whose name has a similar signification, or to the expected Messiah, who in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/9-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/9-6.html">Isaiah 9:6</a> ) is expressly called the Prince of Peace. [<B><a href="messiah.html" target="_blank" url="messiah.html">MESSIAH</a></B>] Other interpretations, however, of the passage are given, one of which makes it refer to the city of this name. [See the following article] It might be translated "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the rulers staff from between his feet, till he shall go to Shiloh." In this case the allusion would be to the primacy of Judah in war, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/1-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/1-1.html">Judges 1:1</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/1-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/1-2.html">Judges 1:2</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-18.html">20:18</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/2-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/2-3.html">Numbers 2:3</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/10-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/10-14.html">10:14</a> ) which was to continue until the promised land was conquered and the ark of the covenant was solemnly deposited at Shiloh. </FONT></body></html>
