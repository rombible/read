<P> Given in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:2">Genesis 10:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:5">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:5</A> f as a son of Japheth. The name evidently designates the people called Gimirra by the Assyrians, Kimmerians by the Greeks. They were a barbaric horde of Aryans who in the 7th century BC left their abode in what is now Southern Russia and poured. through the Caucasus into Western Asia, causing serious trouble to the Assyrians and other nations. One division moved eastward toward Media, another westward, where they conquered Cappadocia and made it their special abode. They fought also in other parts of Asia Minor, conquering some portions. The Armenian name for Cappadocia, Gamir, has come from this people. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+38:6">Ezekiel 38:6</A> Gomer is mentioned as one of the northern nations.
