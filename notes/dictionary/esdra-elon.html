The western section of it is properly the plain of Accho or <I>Akka</I> . The main body of the plain is a triangle. Its base on the east extends from <I>Jenin</I> (the ancient Engannim) to the foot of the hills below Nazareth, and is about 15 miles long; the north side, formed by the hills of Galilee, is about 12 miles long; and the south side, formed by the Samaria range, is about 18 miles. The apex on the west is a narrow pass opening into the plain of <I>Akka</I> . From the base of this triangular plain three branches stretch out eastward, like fingers from a hand, divided by two bleak, gray ridges --one bearing the familiar name of Mount Gilboa, the other called by Franks Little Hermon, but by natives <I>Jebel ed-Duhy</I> . The central branch is the richest as well as the most celebrated. This is the "valley of Jezreel" proper --the battle-field on which Gideon triumphed, and Saul and Jonathan were overthrown.

Two things are worthy of special notice in the plain of Esdraelon: <OL><LI>Its wonderful richness; <LI>Its present desolation. If we except the eastern branches, there is not a single inhabited village on its whole surface, and not more than one-sixth of its soil is cultivated. It is the home of the wild wandering Bedouin. </OL></FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
