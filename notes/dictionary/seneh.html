<P> This was the name attaching to the southern of the two great cliffs between which ran the gorge of Michmash (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:4" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:4</A>). The name means "acacia," and may have been given to it from the thorn bushes growing upon it. Josephus (BJ, V, ii, 1) mentions the "plain of thorns" near Gabathsaul. We may hear an echo of the old name in that of Wady Suweinit, "valley of the little thorn tree," the name by which the gorge is known today. The cliff must have stood on the right side of the wady; see <a href="bozez.html">BOZEZ</a>. Conder gives an excellent description of the place in Tent Work in Palestine, II, 112-14.
