            <P><B>NURSE; NURSING</B><P> nurs, nurs'-ing:
<P> "Nurse" in the King James Version represents two different Hebrew words: In 8 passages (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+24:59">Genesis 24:59</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+35:8">35:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:7,9">Exodus 2:7,9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+11:2">2&nbsp;Kings 11:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+22:11">2&nbsp;Chronicles 22:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+49:23">Isaiah 49:23</A>) the word--noun or verb--renders some form of the verb yanaq, "to suck." The feminine causative part. of this verb is commonly used to denote nurse or foster-mother. According to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:7">Exodus 2:7</A> Moses' mother--"a nurse of the Hebrew women"--became, at Pharaoh's daughter's request, the foster-mother of the foundling. Joash, the son of Ahaziah, was in charge of a nurse until he was 7 years old (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+11:2">2&nbsp;Kings 11:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+22:11">2&nbsp;Chronicles 22:11</A>). But it is obvious that the term was used in a more general way, e.g. of a lady's maid or tire-woman. Rebekah was accompanied by her nurse when she left home to be married (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+24:59">Genesis 24:59</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+35:8">35:8</A>). In 5 passages (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:12">Numbers 11:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+4:16">Ruth 4:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+4:4">2&nbsp;Samuel 4:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+49:23">Isaiah 49:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+60:4">60:4</A> the King James Version) "nurse" represents the Hebrew word, 'aman, "to support," "be faithful," "nourish." The participle of this verb denoted a person who had charge of young children--a guardian or governess. Naomi took charge of Ruth's child "and became nurse unto it" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+4:16">Ruth 4:16</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:12">Numbers 11:12</A> Moses asks whether he has to take charge of the Israelites "as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child." The same word is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+10:15">2&nbsp;Kings 10:15</A> (the King James Version "them that brought up," i.e. "guardians of the sons of Ahab) and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+2:7">Esther 2:7</A> (the King James Version "and he brought up," i.e. he (Mordecai) adopted, his niece). Deutero-Isa uses both terms together (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+49:23">Isaiah 49:23</A>) to describe the exalted position of Israel in the future when foreign kings and queens will offer their services and wait upon the chosen people.
<P> In the solitary passage in the New Testament where "nurse" occurs, it renders the Greek word trophos. In this case the word does not mean a hired nurse, but a mother who nurses her own children (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:7">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:7</A>).
