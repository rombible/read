(B.C. 1063.) Abner, therefore, was Sauls first cousin, and was made by him commander-in-chief of his army. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/14-51.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/14-51.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:51</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/17-57.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/17-57.html">17:57</a> ;  <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1%20Samuel+26:5-14" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=1%20Samuel+26:5-14&amp;t=niv">26:5-14</a> ) After the death of Saul David was proclaimed king of Judah; and some time subsequently Abner proclaimed Ish-bosheth, Sauls son, king of Israel. War soon broke out between the two rival kings, and a "very sore battle" was fought at Gibeon between the men of Israel under Abner and the men of Judah under Joab. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/2-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/2-16.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:16</a> ) Abner had married Rizpah, Sauls concubine, and this, according to the views of Oriental courts, might be so interpreted as to imply a design upon the throne. Rightly or wrongly, Ish-bosheth so understood it, and he even ventured to reproach Abner with it. Abner, incensed at his ingratitude, opened negotiations with David, by whom he was most favorably received at Hebron. He then undertook to procure his recognition throughout Israel; but after leaving his presence for the purpose was enticed back by Joab, and treacherously murdered by him and his brother Abishai, at the gate of the city, partly, no doubt, from fear lest so distinguished a convert to their cause should gain too high a place in Davids favor, but ostensibly in retaliation for the death of Asahel. David in sorrow and indignation, poured forth a simple dirge over the slain hero.
