            <P><B>IN</B><P> A principal thing to notice about this preposition, which in the King James Version represents about 16 Hebrew and as many Greek words and prepositions, is that, in hundreds of cases (especially in the Old Testament, but frequently also in the New Testament) in the Revised Version (British and American) the rendering is changed to more exact forms ("to," "unto," "by," "upon," "at," "with," "among," "for," "throughout," etc.; compare e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:16">Genesis 6:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+13:8">13:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+17:7,9,12">17:7,9,12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+18:1">18:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+8:17">Exodus 8:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+1:9">Leviticus 1:9</A>, etc.); while, nearly as often, "in" is substituted for divergent forms of the King James Version (e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:14">Genesis 2:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+17:11">17:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+31:54">31:54</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+40:7">40:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+49:17">49:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+8:14,24">Exodus 8:14,24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+3:17">Leviticus 3:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+4:2">4:2</A>, etc.). The chief Greek preposition en, is frequently adhered to as "in" in the Revised Version (British and American) where the King James Version has other forms ("with," "among," etc.; compare "in" for "with" in John's baptism, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</A>, and parallel; "in the tombs" for "among the tombs," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:3">Mark 5:3</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:2">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:2</A>, "shaken in mind" in the King James Version is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version (British and American) "shaken from (apo) your mind." There are numerous such instructive changes.
