            <P><B>FERVENT</B><P> fur'-vent (dalaq; ektenes, zeo):
<P> "Fervent" (from Latin fervere, "to boil") does not occur in the King James Version of the Old Testament, but the Revised Version (British and American) gives it as the translation of dalaq, "to burn" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+26:23">Proverbs 26:23</A>), instead of "burning," "fervent lips and a wicked heart." In the New Testament it is the translation of ektenes, "stretched out," hence, intent, earnest (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+4:8">1&nbsp;Peter 4:8</A>, "being fervent in your love among yourselves"); of zeo, "to boil," "to be hot" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</A>, "fervent in spirit," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</A>); of zelos, "zeal," "fervor" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+7:7">2&nbsp;Corinthians 7:7</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "zeal"), in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+5:16">James 5:16</A> the King James Version has:
<P> "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much," where the Greek is: polu ischuei deesis dikaiou energoumene, which the Revised Version (British and American) renders, "The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working."
<P> "Fervently" is the translation of agonizomai, "to strive or struggle" (agonize), <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</A> the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) "Epaphras .... striving for you in his prayers"; of ektenos, literally, in an outstretched manner (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+1:22">1&nbsp;Peter 1:22</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "Love one another from the heart fervently"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+4:8">1&nbsp;Peter 4:8</A>, "fervent in your love among yourselves"). Christian love too often lacks this fervency, but Christ's love for us was "stretched out" to the uttermost.
<P> The Revised Version (British and American) has "fervently" for "earnestly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+5:17">James 5:17</A>, margin "with prayer").
