            <P><B>PIRATHON; PIRATHONITE</B><P> pir'-a-thon, pir'-a-thon-it (pir`athon, pir`athoni; Codex Vaticanus Pharathom; Codex Alexandrinus Phraathom, Pharathuneites):
<P> The home of Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+12:13">Judges 12:13</A> the King James Version), where also he was buried, "in the land of Ephraim in the mount of the Amalekites." The latter name may have clung to a district which at some former time had been held by the Amalekites. From this town also came Benaiah, one of David's chief captains (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:30">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:31">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:14">27:14</A>). It is probably to be identified with Fer`ata, about 6 miles Southwest of Nablus. A possible rival is Fir`on, 15 miles West of Nablus. G.A. Smith suggests a position at the head of Wady Far`ah (HGHL, 355). Moore thinks it may have been in Benjamin, Abdon being a Benjamite family (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:23,30">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:23,30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:36">9:36</A>). It is just possible that the place may be identical with Pharathon, one of the towns fortified by Bacchides (1 Macc 9:50).
