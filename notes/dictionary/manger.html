            <P><B>MANGER</B><P> man'-jer (phatne):
<P> Properly the place in a stall or stable where the food of cattle is placed (in the Old Testament "crib" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:9">Job 39:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+14:4">Proverbs 14:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+1:3">Isaiah 1:3</A>)); thus also, apparently, in the narrative of the nativity in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+2:7,12,16">Luke 2:7,12,16</A>. In Septuagint, the Greek word, representing different Hebrew words, has also the extended meaning of "stall" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+32:28">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+3:17">Habakkuk 3:17</A>); thus also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+13:15">Luke 13:15</A>, where the Revised Version margin has "manger." Old tradition says that Jesus was born in a cave in the neighborhood of Bethlehem; even so, a place for food for cattle may have been cut in the side of the rock.
