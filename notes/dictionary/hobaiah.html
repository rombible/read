            <P><B>HOBAIAH</B><P> ho-ba'-ya (chobhayah, "whom Yahweh hides," i.e. "protects"):
<P> The head of a priestly family that returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel. Because they could not trace their genealogy, they were not permitted to serve in the priestly office (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:63">Nehemiah 7:63</A>). In the Qere of this passage and in the parallel list of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:61">Ezra 2:61</A>, this name appears in the form "Habaiah" (chabhayyah). "Obdia" is the form of the word in 1 Esdras 5:38.
