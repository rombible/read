            <P><B>CASPHOR</B><P> kas'-for (the King James Version Casphon; Kasphor, 1 Macc 5:26; Chasphon, Chasphoth, 5:36; Kaspein, 2 Macc 12:13):
<P> A city East of the Jordan captured by Judas Maccabeus (1 Macc 5:36). It is probably identical with Caspis of 2 Macc 12:13. It was a fortress of great strength, with a lake near it. This has led some to think it may be represented by el-Muzerib, an important station on the pilgrim route to Mecca. The ancient name of this city, however, has not been discovered.
