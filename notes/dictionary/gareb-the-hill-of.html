            <P><B>GAREB, THE HILL OF</B><P> ga'-reb, (garebh):
<P> A hill in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, which was one of the landmarks to which the prophet Jeremiah (31:39) foresaw that the city should extend. The site is unknown. Cheyne (Encyclopedia Biblica) would connect this with the "mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:8">Joshua 15:8</A>), but this is too far South; it is inconceivable that the prophet could have imagined the city extending so far in this direction; most probably the hill was to the North--the one natural direction for the city's extension--and is now incorporated in the modern suburbs.
<P> E. W. G. Masterman
