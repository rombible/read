            <P><B>HOZAI</B><P> ho'-za-i (chozay, or as it stands at the close of the verse in question, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+33:19">2&nbsp;Chronicles 33:19</A>, chozay; Septuagint ton horonton; Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) "Hozai"; the King James Version the seers; the King James Version margin "Hosai"; the American Standard Revised Version "Hozia," the American Revised Version margin "the seers." Septuagint not improbably reads ha-chozim, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+33:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 33:18</A>; an easy error, since there we find we-dhibhere ha-chozim, "the words of the seers," and here dibhere chozay, "the words of Hozai." Kittel, following Budde, conjectures as the original reading chozayw, "his (Manasseh's) seers"):
<P> A historiographer of Manasseh, king of Judah. Thought by many of the Jews, incorrectly, to be the prophet Isaiah, who, as we learn from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+26:22">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:22</A>, was historiographer of a preceding king, Uzziah. This "History of Hozai" has not come down to us. The prayer of Manasseh, mentioned in 33:12,18 f and included in this history, suggested the apocryphal book, "The Prayer of Manasses," written, probably, in the 1st century BC.
