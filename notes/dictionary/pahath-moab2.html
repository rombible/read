Of the individual or the occasion of his receiving so singular a name nothing is known certainty but as we read in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/4-22.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/4-22.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:22</a> ) of a family of Shilonites, of the tribe of Judah, who in very early times "had dominion in Moab," it may be conjectured that this was the origin of the name. </FONT></body></html>
