<P> The strict meaning is of course "at the present moment," "instantly," and the modern force "after a short interval" is due simply to the procrastinating habits of mankind; hence, the Revised Version (British and American) modifications of the King James Version use of the word into "immediately" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</A>), "even now" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:53">Matthew 26:53</A>), and "forthwith" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:23">Philippians 2:23</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+12:16">Proverbs 12:16</A>, the uncertainty of the meaning (margin "openly," Hebrew "in the day") has led to the retention of the King James Version word.
