            <P><B>BETHANY</B><P> beth'-a-ni (Bethania):
<P> (1) A village, 15 furlongs from Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+11:18">John 11:18</A>), on the road to Jericho, at the Mount of Olives (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:1">Mark 11:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:29">Luke 19:29</A>), where lived "Simon the leper" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</A>) and Mary, Martha and Lazarus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+11:18">John 11:18</A>). This village may justifiably be called the Judean home of Jesus, as He appears to have preferred to lodge there rather than in Jerusalem itself (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+21:17">Matthew 21:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:11">Mark 11:11</A>). Here occurred the incident of the raising of Lazarus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+11">John 11</A>) and the feast at the house of Simon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:1-13">Matthew 26:1-13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+14:3-9">Mark 14:3-9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:2:1-8">John 1:2:1-8</A>). The Ascension as recorded in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+24:50-51">Luke 24:50-51</A> is thus described:
<P> "He led them out until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven."
<P> Bethany is today el `Azareyeh ("the place of Lazarus"--the L being displaced to form the article). It is a miserably untidy and tumble-down village facing East on the Southeast slope of the Mount of Olives, upon the carriage road to Jericho. A fair number of fig, almond and olive trees surround the houses. The traditional tomb of Lazarus is shown and there are some remains of medieval buildings, besides rock-cut tombs of much earlier date (PEF, III, 27, Sheet XVII).
<P> (2) "Bethany beyond the Jordan" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:28">John 1:28</A>; the King James Version Bethabara; Bethabara, a reading against the majority of the manuscripts, supported by Origen on geographical grounds):
<P> No such place is known. Grove suggested that the place intended is
 \BETH-NIMRAH\ (which see), the modern Tell nimrin, a singularly suitable place, but hard to fit in with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:28">John 1:28</A>; compare
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:1">John 2:1</A>. The traditional site is the ford East of Jericho.
