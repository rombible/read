            <P><B>EARTHEN VESSELS</B><P> urth'-'-n, (cheres, yetser; ostrakinos):
<P> These vessels were heat-resisting and were used for cooking and for boiling clothes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+6:28">Leviticus 6:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:33">11:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+14:5,50">14:5,50</A>). They were probably non-porous and took the place of the kidri or ma'ajin used in Syria today. A traveler in the interior of Palestine may still meet with the hospitality showed to David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+17:28">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:28</A>). The generous natives brought not only gifts of food but the necessary vessels in which to cook it. An earthen vessel was used to preserve a land deed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+32:14">Jeremiah 32:14</A>).
<P> Figurative:
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+19:1">Jeremiah 19:1</A> breaking of an earthen vessel was symbolical of the destruction of Jerusalem. These vessels were also used to symbolize the commonness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+4:2">Lamentations 4:2</A>) and frailness of our bodies (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+4:7">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:7</A>).
