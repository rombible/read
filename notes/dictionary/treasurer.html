            <P><B>TREASURER</B><P> ('atsar, gedhabhar, gizbar, cakhan; oikonomos):
<P> (1) 'Atsar, meaning primarily "to store up," and hence, one who lays up in store, i.e. a "treasurer":
<P> "I made treasurers over the treasuries" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+13:13">Nehemiah 13:13</A>).
<P> (2) Gedhabhar (Aramaic), used only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+3:2,3">Daniel 3:2,3</A>:
<P> "treasurers," named with judges and counselors as recognized officials.
<P> (3) Gizbar, used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+7:21">Ezra 7:21</A> (Aramaic) and equivalent in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:8">Ezra 1:8</A> (Hebrew):
<P> "treasurers beyond the river" and "Mithredath the treasurer."
<P> (4) Cakhan, primarily meaning "one who ministers to," and hence, a keeper of treasure, treasurer:
<P> "Get thee unto this treasurer" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+22:15">Isaiah 22:15</A>). Perhaps the idea of steward is here intended.
<P> (5) Oikonomos, by the King James Version translated "chamberlain," more properly in the American Standard Revised Version translated "treasurer":
<P> "Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</A>).
