            <P><B>SHUNEM</B><P> shoo'-nem (shunem; Codex Vaticanus Sounan; Codex Alexandrinus Sounam):
<P> A town in the territory of Issachar named with Jezreel and Chesulloth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:18">Joshua 19:18</A>). Before the battle of Gilboa the Philistines pitched their camp here. They and the army of Saul, stationed on Gilboa, were in full view of each other (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+28:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 28:4</A>). It was the scene of the touching story recorded in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+4:8-37">2&nbsp;Kings 4:8-37</A>, in which the prophet Elisha raises to life the son of his Shunammite benefactress. Eusebius (Onomasticon) describes it as a village called Sulem, 5 Roman miles South of Mt. Tabor. This points to the modern Solam, a village surrounded by cactus hedges and orchards on the lower southwestern slope of Jebel ed-Duchy ("Hill of Moreh"). It commands an uninterrupted view across the plain of Esdraelon to Mt. Carmel, which is about 15 miles distant. It also looks far across the valley of Jezreel to the slopes of Gilboa on the South. It therefore meets satisfactorily the conditions of Joshua and 1 Samuel. A question has, however, been raised as to its identity with the Shunem of 2Ki 4. Elisha's home was in Samaria. Apparently Carmel was one of his favorite haunts. If he passed Shunem "continually" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+4:9">2&nbsp;Kings 4:9</A>), going to and coming from the mountain, it involved a very long detour if this were the village visited. It would seem more natural to identify the Shunem of Elisha with the Sanim of Eusebius, Onomasticon, which is said to be in the territory of Sebaste (Samaria), in the region of Akrabatta: or perhaps with Salim, fully a mile North of Taanach, as nearer the line of travel between Samaria and Carmel.
<P> There is, however, nothing to show that Elisha's visits to Shunem were paid on his journeys between Samaria and Carmel. It may have been his custom to visit certain cities on circuit, on business calling for his personal attention, e.g. in connection with the "schools of the prophets." Materials do not exist on which any certain conclusion can rest. Both Solam Salim are on the edge of the splendid grain fields of Esdraelon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+4:18">2&nbsp;Kings 4:18</A>).
