            <P><B>TRESPASS</B><P> tres'-pas:
<P> To pass over, to go beyond one's right in place or act; to injure another; to do that which annoys or inconveniences another; any violation of law, civil or moral; it may relate to a person, a community, or the state, or to offenses against God. The Hebrew 'asham ("sin"), is used very frequently in the Old Testament when the trespass is a violation of law of which God is the author. The Greek word is paraptoma.
<P> In the Old Testament an offering was demanded when the offense was against God:
<P> a female lamb; in other cases, according to the magnitude of the wrong, a ram or a goat; the offering was to be preceded by a confession by the one committing the trespass. If the trespass was against a human being, the wrong-doer must make it right with the person, and when reconciliation should have been effected, then the offering for sin was to be made. See under SACRIFICE, "Trespass Offering." If a person's property has been injured, then the trespasser shall add a fifth to the value of the property injured and give that to the injured party (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+6:5">Leviticus 6:5</A>). Zaccheus, wanting to make full restitution, went beyond the demands of the Law (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:1-9">Luke 19:1-9</A>).
<P> The New Testament teaching on the subject is, first to be reconciled to the brother and then offer, or worship (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+5:23,24">Matthew 5:23,24</A>). In all cases, also, the offended party must forgive if the offender shall say, "I repent" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</A>). We have been alienated by our trespasses from God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</A>). It was the Father's good will to reconcile all to Himself through Christ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+1:20-22">Colossians 1:20-22</A>). We must be reconciled to God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+5:20,21">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:20,21</A>). This being done, our trespasses shall be forgiven and we shall be justified.
<P> David Roberts Dungan
