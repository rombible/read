<P> (1) `ets shemen, translated the Revised Version (British and American) "wild olive," the King James Version "pine" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:15">Nehemiah 8:15</A>); the Revised Version (British and American) "oil-tree," m "oleaster" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+41:19">Isaiah 41:19</A>); "olive-wood" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:23,31-33">1&nbsp;Kings 6:23,31-33</A>). See OIL TREE. (2) tidhhar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+41:19">Isaiah 41:19</A>, margin "plane"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+60:13">Isaiah 60:13</A>); peuke, "fir." Lagarde, from similarity of tidhhar to the Syriac deddar, usually the "elm," considers this the best translation. Symmachus also translated tidhhar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+41:19">Isaiah 41:19</A>) by ptelea, the "elm." The elm, Ulmus campestris, is rare in Palestine and the Lebanon, though it is found today N. of Aleppo. Post (HDB, III, 592-93) considers that
<P> (1) should be translated as "pine," which he describes as a "fat wood tree"; it is perhaps as probably a correct translation for
<P> (2), but great uncertainty remains.
<P> Two species of pine are plentiful in the Lebanon and flourish in most parts of Palestine when given a chance. These are the stone pine, Pinus pinea, and the Aleppo pine, P. halepensis; all the highlands looking toward the sea are suited to their growth.
