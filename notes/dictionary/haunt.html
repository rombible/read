            <P><B>HAUNT</B><P> hont, hant:
<P> The verb in Old English was simply "to resort to," "frequent"; a place of dwelling or of business was a haunt. The noun occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+23:22">1&nbsp;Samuel 23:22</A> as the translation of reghel, "foot," "See his place where his haunt is," the Revised Version margin, Hebrew `foot' "; the verb is the translation of yashabh, "to sit down," "to dwell" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+26:17">Ezekiel 26:17</A>, "on all that haunt it," the Revised Version (British and American) "dwelt there," margin "inhabited her"), and of halakh, "to go,"' or "live" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:31">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:31</A>, "all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt").
