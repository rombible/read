            <P><B>DEDAN; DEDANITES</B><P> de'-dan, de'dan-its (the King James Version Dedanim, ded'-a-nim; dedhan, "low," dedhanim):
<P> An Arabian people named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:7">Genesis 10:7</A> as descended from Cush; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:3">Genesis 25:3</A> as descended from Keturah. Evidently, they were, like the related Sheba (Sabaeans), of mixed race (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:7,28">Genesis 10:7,28</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+21:13">Isaiah 21:13</A> allusion is made to the "caravans of Dedanites" in the wilds of Arabia, and Eze mentions them as supplying Tyre with precious things (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:20">Ezekiel 27:20</A>; in verse 15, "Dedan" should probably be read as in Septuagint, "Rodan," i.e. Rhodians). The name seems still to linger in the island of Dadan, on the border of the Persian Gulf. It is found also in Min. and Sab. inscriptions (Glazer, II, 392).
