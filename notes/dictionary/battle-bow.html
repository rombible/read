            <P><B>BATTLE-BOW</B><P> bat'-'-l-bo:
<P> Found in the striking Messianic prophecy: "The battle bow shall be cut off" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+9:10">Zechariah 9:10</A>). The prophet is predicting the peace that shall prevail when Zion's king cometh, "just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass." The words convey their full significance only when read in the light of the context: "I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+10:4">Zechariah 10:4</A>). The battle-bow was sometimes made of tough wood, sometimes of two straight horns joined together (Hom. II. iv.105-11), and sometimes of bronze. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:34">Psalms 18:34</A> the Revised Version (British and American) we find "bow of brass," but it probably should be of "bronze" (nechosheth), a metal very different from our brass, which is a mixture of copper and zinc. The point of the passage in this connection ("He teacheth my hands to war; so that mine arms do bend a bow of bronze"), as well as of that in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+9:24">2&nbsp;Kings 9:24</A> ("And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength") is that it required great strength to bend the battle-bow.
