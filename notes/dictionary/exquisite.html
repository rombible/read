            <P><B>EXQUISITE</B><P> eks'-kwi-sit (akribes):
<P> The Greek word means "accurate" "searched out," equivalent to exquisitus from which "exquisite" is derived. It also means in argument "close," "subtle." In Ecclesiasticus 18:29, we have, "They poured forth exquisite parables," the Revised Version (British and American) "apt proverbs," and 19:25, the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American)
<P> "There is an exquisite subtleity, and the same is unjust."
