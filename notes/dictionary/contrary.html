            <P><B>CONTRARY</B><P> kon'-tra-ri (qeri; enantios):
<P> In the Old Testament it has the sense of antagonistic, as one person opposed or hostile to the other, especially in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+26:21,23,14,27,28,40,41">Leviticus 26:21,23,14,27,28,40,41</A>, where Yahweh declares His attitude toward the people in such phrases as: "If ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath."
<P> In the New Testament it has a more varied significance and is applied to both material and human relations as simply opposite, set over against an object or thing. Used of the wind as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+14:24">Matthew 14:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:48">Mark 6:48</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:4">Acts 27:4</A>, where it is spoken of as contrary. Refers also to conflicting doctrines, customs or beliefs, as
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:10">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:10</A>, "and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine." Several other Greek words are translated with almost an identical meaning. Occasionally a prefix gives a slightly different shade of meaning.
