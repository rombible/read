            <P><B>STRANGLED</B><P> stran'-g'-ld (chanaq; pniktos, from verb pnigo, "to choke," "to smother," "to strangle" (compare choking of swine in the lake, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</A>; the seed are choked by the thorns, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:7">Matthew 13:7</A>; the servant takes his fellow-servant by the throat, the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+18:28">Matthew 18:28</A>)):
<P> As adjective "strangled," used of animals deprived of life by choking, and so without the shedding of the blood. Flesh thus killed was forbidden as food among the Hebrews, because it contained the blood (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+17:12">Leviticus 17:12</A>). Even Jewish Christians in the Jerusalem council thought it best to forbid things strangled to be eaten by Gentile converts, so as not to give offense to Jewish sentiment, and doubtless also to prevent participation in heathen sacrificial feasts (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:25">21:25</A>).
