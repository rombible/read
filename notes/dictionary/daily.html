            <P><B>DAILY</B><P> da'-li:
<P> This word, coming as it does from the Hebrew yom "day," and the Greek hemera, suggests either day by day (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+5:13">Exodus 5:13</A>), that which is prepared for one daily (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+5:18">Nehemiah 5:18</A>), as e.g. our "daily bread," meaning bread sufficient for that day (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:11">Matthew 6:11</A>); or day by day continuously, one day after another in succession, as "the daily burnt offering" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+29:6">Numbers 29:6</A> the King James Version), "daily ministration" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</A>), and "daily in the temple" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:42">Acts 5:42</A> the King James Version). The meaning of the word "daily" as used in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:11">Matthew 6:11</A>) seems to indicate sufficient for our need, whether we consider that need as a day at a time, or day after day as we are permitted to live. "Give us bread sufficient for our sustenance."
