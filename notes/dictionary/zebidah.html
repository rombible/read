            <P><B>ZEBIDAH</B><P> ze-bi'-da, zeb'-i-da (zebhudhah, Qere, whence the King James Version "Zebudah," whereas the Kethibh is zebhidhah; the Qere means "bestowed" and is the feminine of Zabud):
<P> Daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah, and mother of King Jehoiakim of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:36">2&nbsp;Kings 23:36</A>). The Septuagint's Codex Vaticanus has, however, Iella thugater Edeil ek Krouma, Codex Alexandrinus Eieldaph th. Eieddila ek Rhuma. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+36:5">2&nbsp;Chronicles 36:5</A> Massoretic Text lacks these names, but the Septuagint Codex Vaticanus has Zechora th. Nereiou ek Rhama; here the name of the king's mother = Hebrew zekhurah, due to a confusion of the Hebrew letter kaph (k) with the Hebrew letter beth (b), and the Hebrew letter resh (r) with the Hebrew letter daleth (d), and thus we find support for the Qere, zebhudhah ("Zebudah," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:36">2&nbsp;Kings 23:36</A> the King James Version). Lucian has confused the names here with those of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+24:18">2&nbsp;Kings 24:18</A>, and has as there, "Amital, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
