            <P><B>BEZER</B><P> be'-zer (betser; Bosor, "strong"):
<P> (1) A city of refuge, set apart by Moses for the Reubenites and located in the "plain country" (or table-land, Mishor) East of the Jordan, later assigned to this tribe by Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+4:43">Deuteronomy 4:43</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+20:8">Joshua 20:8</A>). The same city was assigned by lot as place of residence to the children of Merari of the Levite tribe (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:36">Joshua 21:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:63,78">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:63,78</A>). Driver, HDB, suggests the identity of Bezer with Bozrah (Septuagint, Bosor) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:24">Jeremiah 48:24</A>).
