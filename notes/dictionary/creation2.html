The <I>method</I> of creation is not stated in Genesis, and as far as the account there is concerned, each part of it may be, after the first acts of creation, by evolution, or by direct act of Gods will. The word <I>create</I> (bara) is used but three times in the first chapter of Genesis-- (1) as to the origin of matter; (2) as to the origin of life; (3) as to the origin of mans soul; and science has always failed to do any of these acts thus ascribed to God. All other things are said to be <I>made</I> . The <I>order of creation</I> as given in Genesis is in close harmony with the order as revealed by geology, and the account there given, so long before the records of the rocks were read or the truth discoverable by man, is one of the strongest proofs that the Bible was inspired by God. --Ed.) </FONT></body></html>
