            <P><B>MIDIANITISH, WOMAN</B><P> mid'-i-an-it-ish, (ha-midhyanith, "the Midianitess"):
<P> The designation given to the daughter of Zur, Cozbi, whom Zimri the son of Salu brought into the camp of Israel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:6-18">Numbers 25:6-18</A>). Both were of noble parentage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:14,15">Numbers 25:14,15</A>). The majority of the people strongly resented this act of profanation (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:6">Numbers 25:6</A>). A pestilence was raging in the camp, and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, in an outburst of zeal pursued the two delinquents and slew them by a spear-thrust through their bodies (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:8">Numbers 25:8</A>). He obtained as a reward the immediate staying of the plague and the promise of perpetual priesthood to his family (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:8,13">Numbers 25:8,13</A>).
