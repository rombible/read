            <P><B>COLLAR</B><P> kol'-ar, kol'-er:
<P> (1) (neTphah, plural neTphoth, literally, "drops," from naTaph, "to drop"). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:26">Judges 8:26</A> includes neTphoth among the spoils taken from the Midianites and Ishmaelites; the Revised Version (British and American) "pendants," the King James Version "collars." Qimchi at the place suggests "perfume-dropper."
<P> (2) (peh, literally, "mouth"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+30:18">Job 30:18</A> the word is used to indicate the collar band, or hole of a robe, through which the head was inserted. Job, in describing his suffering and writhing, mentions the disfiguring of his garment, and suggests that the whole thing feels as narrow or close-fitting as the neckband, or perhaps that in his fever and pains he feels as if the neckband itself is choking him.
<P> (3) (tsinoq, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+29:26">Jeremiah 29:26</A>, "stocks"; the Revised Version (British and American) "shackles," which see; the Revised Version, margin "collar"). An instrument of torture or punishment.
<P> Nathan Isaacs
