            <P><B>SHEBA (2)</B><P> she'-ba (shebha`; Sabee, or Samaa):
<P> The name of one of the towns allotted to Simeon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:2">Joshua 19:2</A>). the King James Version mentions it as an independent town, but as it is not mentioned at all in the parallel list (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:28">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:28</A>), and is omitted in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:2">Joshua 19:2</A> in some manuscripts, it is probable that the Revised Version (British and American) is correct in its translation "Beer-sheba or Sheba." Only in this way can the total of towns in this group be made 13 (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:6">Joshua 19:6</A>). If it is a separate name, it is probably the same as SHEMA (which see).
