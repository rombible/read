(B.C.1450.) For a certain period after the establishment of the Israelite rule the new name remained, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/8-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/8-11.html">Judges 8:11</a> ) but it is not again heard of, and the original appellation, as is usual in such cases, appears to have recovered its hold, has since retained; for in the slightly-modified form of <I>Kunawat</I> it is the name of the place to the present day. </FONT></body></html>
