            <P><B>HETHLON</B><P> heth'-lon (chethlon; Peshitta chethron):
<P> Name of a place associated with Zedad on the ideal northern boundary of Israel, as given in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:15">Ezekiel 47:15</A> and 48:1, but not named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:8">Numbers 34:8</A>, while the Septuagint evidently translated the text it had. In accordance with the opinion they hold as to the boundary line of Northern Israel, van Kasteren and Buhl seek to identify Hethlon with 'Adlun on the river Qasmiyeh. Much more in harmony with the line of the other border towns given is its identification with Heitala to the Northeast of Tripoli. The "way of Hethlon" would then coincide with the Eleutherus valley, between Homs and the Mediterranean, through which the railway now runs, and to this identification the Septuagint seems to give testimony, indicating some path of "descent" from the Biqa'a.
