            <P><B>ORPAH</B><P> or'-pa (`orpah; for meaning see below):
<P> A Moabitess, wife of Mahlon, son of Elimelech and Naomi. Unlike her sister Ru she returned to her own people after escorting Naomi on her way to Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+1:4">Ruth 1:4</A>). Her name is supposed to be derived from the Hebrew word for "neck" (`oreph), and so to mean "stiff-necked" because of her turning-back from following her mother-in-law; others take it to mean "gazelle."
