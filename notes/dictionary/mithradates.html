            <P><B>MITHRADATES</B><P> mith-ra-da'-tez (Codex Alexandrinus Mithradates; Codex Vaticanus Mithridates; the King James Version Mithridates):
<P> (1) The treasurer of Cyrus to whom the king committed the vessels which had been taken from the temple and who delivered them to the governor, Sanabassar (1 Esdras 2:11 equals "Mithredath" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:8">Ezra 1:8</A>).
<P> (2) Apparently another person of the same name--one of the commissioners stationed in Samaria who wrote a letter to Artaxerxes persuading him to put a stop to the rebuilding of Jerusalem (1 Esdras 2:16 equals "Mithredath" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:7">Ezra 4:7</A>).
