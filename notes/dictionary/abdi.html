<LI>A Levite, father of Kishi and grandfather of King David's singer Ethan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:44">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:44</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:17</A>). This makes Abdi a contemporary of Saul the king.
<LI>A Levite, father of the Kish who was in service at the beginning of the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:12</A>). Some mistakenly identify this Abdi with the former.
<LI>A man who in  Ezra's time had married a foreign wife (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:26">Ezra 10:26</A>). Not a Levite, but "of the sons of Elam."
