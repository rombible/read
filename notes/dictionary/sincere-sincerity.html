            <P><B>SINCERE; SINCERITY</B><P> sin-ser', sin-ser'-i-ti (tamim; aphtharsia, eilikrineia):
<P> "Sincerity" occurs once in the Old Testament as the translation of tamim, "complete," "entire," "sincere," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+24:14">Joshua 24:14</A>); the same word is translated "sincerity" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+9:16,19">Judges 9:16,19</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "uprightly"). Four different words are rendered "sincere," "sincerely" "sincerity," in the New Testament: adolos, "without guile," "unadulterated," "desire the sincere milk of the word" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:2">1&nbsp;Peter 2:2</A> the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) "the spiritual," the American Revised Version margin "Greek, `belonging to the reason'; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</A>," the English Revised Version margin reasonable"), "milk which is without guile," with no other purpose but to nourish and benefit the soul (Alford); hagnos, "without blame," "pure," "preach Christ .... not sincerely" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+1:17">Philippians 1:17</A>); aphtharsia, "without corruption" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+6:24">Ephesians 6:24</A>, the King James Version "that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity," the American Standard Revised Version "with a love incorruptible," margin " `in incorruption.' See <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</A>," the English Revised Version "uncorruptness"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+2:7">Titus 2:7</A>, the King James Version "shewing uncorruptness .... sincerity," the Revised Version (British and American) "uncorruptness"); gnesios, "not spurious" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+8:8">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:8</A>); eilikrines, literally,, judged of in the sunlight, hence, "clear," "manifest" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</A>); eilikrineia, with same meaning, is translated "sincerity" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+5:8">1&nbsp;Corinthians 5:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+1:12">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+2:17">2:17</A>).
<P> The Revised Version (British and American) has "sincere" for "pure" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+3:1">2&nbsp;Peter 3:1</A>), "sincerely" for "clearly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+33:3">Job 33:3</A>).
<P> In The Wisdom of Solomon 7:25 we have eilikrines in the description of Wisdom as a "pure influence," the Revised Version (British and American) "clear effluence."
