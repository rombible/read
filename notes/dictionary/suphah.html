            <P><B>SUPHAH</B><P> soo'-fa (suphah, for wahebh becuphah; Septuagint reads ten Zoob ephlogise; the King James Version Rea Sea):
<P> Suphah is the region in which Vaheb is situated (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:14">Numbers 21:14</A>). It is probably identical with Suph of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:1">Deuteronomy 1:1</A>. Tristram (Land of Moab, 50 f) suggested identification with Ghor es-Safiyeh], a small oasis East of the mud fiats of Es-Sebkhah], South of the Dead Sea; but "the sibilants do not correspond, and Safiyeh is a specifically Arabic term (Wetzstein in Delitzsch, Gen4, 586, note 2) which does not seem to be a likely explanation of Suphah" (Gray, "Nu," ICC, 285 f). This, and other questions of identification, must wait for solution until a more thorough exploration of the whole district has been accomplished.
