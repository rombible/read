The Hebrews in the patriarchal age, as a pastoral race, did not stand in need of the services Of the horse, and for a long period after their settlement in Canaan they dispensed with it, partly in consequence of the hilly nature of the country, which only admitted of the use of chariots in certain localities, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/1-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/1-19.html">Judges 1:19</a> ) and partly in consequence to the prohibition in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/17-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/17-16.html"> 17:16</a> ) which would be held to apply at all periods. David first established a force of cavalry and chariots, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/8-4.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:4</a> ) but the great supply of horses was subsequently effected by Solomon through his connection with Egypt. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/4-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/4-26.html">1&nbsp;Kings 4:26</a> ) Solomon also established a very active trade in horses, which were brought by dealers out of Egypt and resold, at a profit, to the Hittites. With regard to the trappings and management of the horse we have little information. The bridle was placed over the horses nose, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/30-28.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/30-28.html">Isaiah 30:28</a> ) and a bit or curb is also mentioned.

Saddles were not used until a late period. The horses were not shod, and therefore hoofs are hard "as flint," ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/5-28.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/5-28.html">Isaiah 5:28</a> ) were regarded as a great merit. The chariot-horses were covered with embroidered trappings ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/27-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/27-20.html">Ezekiel 27:20</a> ) Horses and chariots were used also in idolatrous processions, as noticed in regard to the sun.
