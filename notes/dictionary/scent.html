            <P><B>SCENT</B><P> sent:
<P> (1) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+14:7">Hosea 14:7</A>, "The scent (margin "his memorial") thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon." "Scent" is used for zekher (so Massoretic Text, but the pointing is uncertain), properly "memorial," whence the Revised Version margin. The English translation comes through the Septuagint which took z-k-r as "offering of sweet savor," and so "sweet savor." For the "wine of Lebanon" see WINE. If this translation is not right, the alternative is "memorial" in the sense of "renown."
<P> (2) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+14:9">Job 14:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:11">Jeremiah 48:11</A> for reach, "odor." "Scent" of the water in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+14:9">Job 14:9</A> is poetic for "contact with."
<P> (3) The Wisdom of Solomon 11:18 the King James Version has "filthy scents of scattered smoke," where "scent" is used in the obsolete sense of "disagreeable odor." The translation is, however, very loose, and "scents" is a gloss; the Revised Version (British and American) "noisome smoke."
