            <P><B>BALADAN</B><P> bal'-a-dan bal'adhan, "He (i.e. Merodach) has given a son":
<P> Baladan is said in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+20:12">2&nbsp;Kings 20:12</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+39:1">Isaiah 39:1</A> to have been the father of Berodach (Merodach)-Baladan, king of Babylon. Some have thought that the Biblical. writer was wrong here, inasmuch as it is said in the inscriptions of Sargon (Annals, 228, 315; Pt., 122), that Merodach-Baladan was the son of Yakin. It is evident, however, from the analogy of Jehu, who is called by the Assyrian kings the son of Omri, that Yakin is to be looked upon as the founder of the dynasty or kingdom, rather than as the father of Merodach-Baladan. The Bith Yakin, over which Merodach-Baladan is said to have been king, corresponds exactly to the phrase Bith Khumria, or House of Omri, over which Jehu is said to have ruled. There is no reason, then, for supposing that there is an error in either case. There is, however, good reason for believing that the Merodach-Baladan of the Book of Kings was the son of another king of the same name. That only the latter part of the father's name is here mentioned may be compared with the Shalman of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+10:14">Hosea 10:14</A> for the more fully-written Shalmaneser of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+17:3">2&nbsp;Kings 17:3</A>; and with the Jareb of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+5:13">Hosea 5:13</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+10:6">Hosea 10:6</A>, probably for Sennacherib. Such abbreviation of proper names was usual among the Assyrians and Babylonians. See Tallquist, Namenbuch, xiv- xix.
