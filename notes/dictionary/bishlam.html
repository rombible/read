            <P><B>BISHLAM</B><P> bish'-lam (bishlam, "peaceful" (?)):
<P> One of three foreign colonists who wrote a letter of complaint against the Jews to Artaxerxes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:7">Ezra 4:7</A> = 1 Esdras 2:16). In 1 Esdras the reading is "Belemus." "And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes, king of Persia," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:7">Ezra 4:7</A>). The Septuagint renders Bishlam as en eirene, "in peace," as though it were a phrase rather than a proper name; this is clearly an error.
