"To the chief musician upon Shoshannim" is a musical direction to the leader of the temple choir which occurs in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/45-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/45-1.html">Psalms 45:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/69-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/69-1.html">69:1</a> ) and most probably indicates the melody "after" or "in the manner of" (Authorized Version upon") which the psalms were to be sung. Shoshannim-eduth occurs in the same way in the title of ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/80-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/80-1.html">Psalms 80:1</a> ) ... As the words now stand they signify "lilies, a testimony," and the two are separated by a large distinctive accent. In themselves they have no meaning in the present text, and must therefore be regarded as probably a fragment of the beginning of an older psalm with which the choir were familiar. </FONT></body></html>
