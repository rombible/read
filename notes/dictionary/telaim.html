            <P><B>TELAIM</B><P> te-la'-im (ha-tela'-im "the young lambs"; en Galgalois):
<P> The place where Saul "summoned the people, and numbered them" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+15:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 15:4</A>) before his attack on Agag, king of the Amalekites. Some authorities read "Telam" for "Havilah" in verse 7 and also find this name in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+27:8">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:8</A> instead of me`olam. In Septuagint and Josephus (Ant., VI, vii, 2) Gilgal occurs instead of Telaim, on what ground is not known. Probably Telaim is identical with TELEM (which see), though the former may have been the name of a Bedouin tribe inhabiting the latter district. Compare Dhallam Arabs now found South of Tell el-Milch.
