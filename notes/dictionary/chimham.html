            <P><B>CHIMHAM</B><P> kim'-ham (kimham (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+19:37,38">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:37,38</A>) or kimhan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+19:40">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:40</A>) or kemohem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+41:17">Jeremiah 41:17</A> Kt.); this reading, however, may probably be safely ignored):
<P> One of the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, who supported David while the latter was in exile in Mahanaim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+19:37">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:37</A>). After the death of Absalom, Barzillai was invited to spend the remainder of his life with the king; but he refused, and sent his son Chimham in his stead. From the mention of "the habitation of Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+41:17">Jeremiah 41:17</A> the King James Version), it has been inferred that Chimham received a grant of land from David's patrimony at Bethlehem, which retained his name for at least four centuries. It has been suggested that his name was probably Ahinoam ('achino`am).
