            <P><B>JOAKIM</B><P> jo'-a-kim (Ioakeim; the King James Version Joacim):
<P> (1) Jehoiakim, king of Judah and Jerusalem (1 Esdras 1:37-39; Baruch 1:3).
<P> (2) Jehoiachin, son of (1) (1 Esdras 1:43).
<P> (3) Son of Jeshua (1 Esdras 5:5), called by mistake son of Zerubbabel; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:10,26">Nehemiah 12:10,26</A> his name occurs as in 1 Esdras, among the priests and Levitea who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel.
<P> (4) High priest of Jerusalem in the time of Baruch (Baruch 1:7).
<P> (5) High priest in Jerusalem in the days of Judith who, along with "the ancients of the children of Israel," welcomed the heroine back to the city after the death of Holofernes (Judith 4). He cannot be identified with any of the high priests in the lists given in 1 Chronicles or in Josephus, Ant, X, viii, 6. The word means "the Lord hath set up." It is probably symbolical, and tends with other names occurring in the narrative to establish the supposition that the book was a work of imagination composed to support the faith of the Jews in times of stress and difficulty.
<P> (6) The husband of Susanna (Susanna verses 1), perhaps here also a symbolical name.
<P> J. Hutchison
