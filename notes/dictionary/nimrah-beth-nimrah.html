            <P><B>NIMRAH; BETH-NIMRAH</B><P> nim'-ra (nimrah; Codex Vaticanus Nambra; Codex Alexandrinus Ambram), or (beth nimrah; Codex Vaticanus Namram; Codex Alexandria Ambran (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:36">Numbers 32:36</A>); Codex Vaticanus Baithanabra; Codex Alexandrinus Bethamna (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:27">Joshua 13:27</A>)):
<P> These two names evidently refer to the same place; but there is no reason to think, as some have done, from the similarity of the names, that it is identical with NIMRIM (which see). On the contrary, the indications of the passages cited point to a site East of the Jordan valley and Nimrah of the Dead Sea. About 11 miles Northeast of the mouth of the Jordan, where Wady Nimrin, coming down from the eastern up-lands, enters the plain, stands a hill called Tell Nimrin, with tombs and certain traces of ancient building. This may be certainly identified with Nimrah and Beth-nimrah; and it corresponds to Bethnambris of Eusebius, Onomasticon, which lay 5 Roman miles Nimrah of Livias.
