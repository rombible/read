            <P><B>ENDEAVOR</B><P> en-de'-ver:
<P> The sense of this word has suffered weakening since the time of the King James Version. Then it implied utmost exertion and success; now rather forlorn hope and possible failure. Thus the Revised Version (British and American) reads "giving diligence," "give diligence," for the King James Version "endeavoring," "endeavor," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+1:15">2&nbsp;Peter 1:15</A>, respectively; but "endeavored" is suffered to remain in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:17</A> (spoudazo, "hasten," "exert oneself"). Compare also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</A>, the King James Version "endeavored," the Revised Version (British and American) "sought" (Greek zeteo, "seek").
