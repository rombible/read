            <P><B>SIRION</B><P> sir'-i-on (siryon; Sanior):
<P> The name of Mt. Hermon among the Phoenicians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:9">Deuteronomy 3:9</A>). It is given as "Shirion" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+29:6">Psalms 29:6</A> (Hebrew "breastplate" or "body armor"). Here it is named with Lebanon. Sirion therefore probably did not denote a particular part of the Hermon Range, as did Senir, but may have been suggested by the conformation of the range itself, as seen from the heights above the Phoenician coast.
