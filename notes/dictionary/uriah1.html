( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/11-41.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/11-41.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:41</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/23-39.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/23-39.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:39</a> ) Like others of Davids officers he was a foreigner--a Hittite. His name, however and his manner of speech ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/11-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/11-11.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:11</a> ) indicate that he had adopted the Jewish religion. He married Bath-sheba a woman of extraordinary beauty, the daughter of Eliam--possibly the same as the son of Ahithophel, and one of his brother officers, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/23-34.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/23-34.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:34</a> ) and hence, perhaps, Uriahs first acquaintance with Bath-sheba. It may be inferred from Nathans parable, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/12-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/12-3.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 12:3</a> ) that he was passionately devoted to his wife, and that their union was celebrated in Jerusalem as one of peculiar tenderness. In the first war with Ammon, B.C. 1035, he followed Joab to the siege, and with him remained encamped in the open field. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/12-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/12-11.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 12:11</a> ) He returned to Jerusalem, at an order from the king on the pretext of asking news of the war--really in the hope that his return to his wife might cover the shame of his own crime. The king met with an unexpected obstacle in the austere, soldier-like spirit which guided all Uriahs conduct, and which gives us a high notion of the character and discipline of Davids officers. On the morning of the third day David sent him back to the camp with a letter containing the command to Joab to cause his destruction in the battle. The device of Joab was to observe the part of the wall of Rabbath-ammon where the greatest force of the besieged was congregated, and thither, as a kind of forlorn hope to send Uriah. A sally took place. Uriah and the officers with him advanced as far as the gate of the city, and were there shot down by the archers on the wall. Just as Joab had forewarned the messenger, the king broke into a furious passion on hearing of the loss. The messenger, as instructed by Joab, calmly continued, and ended the story with the words, "Thy servant also Uriah the Hittite, is dead." In a moment Davids anger is appeased. It is one of the touching parts of the story that Uriah falls unconscious of his wifes dishonor. <LI>High priest in the reign of Ahaz. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/8-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/8-2.html">Isaiah 8:2</a> ;  <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2%20Kings+16:10-16" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=2%20Kings+16:10-16&amp;t=niv">2&nbsp;Kings 16:10-16</a> ) He is probably the same as Urijah the priest, who built the altar for Ahaz.
