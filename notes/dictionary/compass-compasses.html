<P> "Compass," noun, is the translation of chugh, "a circle," "vault" or "arch" ("when he set a compass upon the face of the depth" <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+8:27" target="_blank">Proverbs 8:27</A> the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version "circle"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+26:10">Job 26:10</A>; and see <a href="circle.html">CIRCLE</a>;
 <a href="vault-of-earth.html" target="_blank">VAULT OF EARTH</a>); of karkobh, "a margin" "border" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:5">Exodus 27:5</A>, "the compass of the altar," the Revised Version (British and American) "the ledge round," so 38:4); the phrase "to fetch a compass" is the translation of sabhabh, "to turn about," "go round about" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:5">Numbers 34:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:3">Joshua 15:3</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "turn about," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+5:23">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+3:9">2&nbsp;Kings 3:9</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "make a circuit"); of perierchomai, "to go about" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+28:13">Acts 28:13</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "made a circuit"; margin "Some ancient authorities read cast loose"; see
 <a href="circuit.html" target="_blank">CIRCUIT</a>).
<P> "Compasses" is the Revised Version (British and American) for "compass," mechughah, an instrument for describing a circle:
<P> "He marketh it out with the compasses" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+44:13">Isaiah 44:13</A>) in making an idol.
<P> The verb "to compass" occurs frequently in the senses of "to surround" and "to go round about," e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:11">Genesis 2:11</A>, "which compasseth the whole land of Havilah," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+2:1">Deuteronomy 2:1</A>, "We compassed (went around) mount Seir many days"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+31:22">Jeremiah 31:22</A> we have "A new thing on the earth:
<P> a woman shall compass a man," the Revised Version (British and American) "encompass"; possibly as a suitor; but more probably as a protector. In those happy days, the protection of women (under God, 31:28) will be sufficient, while the men are at their work; "to encompass" ("The cords of death compassed me" <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:4">Psalms 18:4</A>; "the waves of death," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+22:5">2&nbsp;Samuel 22:5</A>). "To gird" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+50:11">Isaiah 50:11</A> the Revised Version (British and American)); "to lie around," "to be laid around" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</A>, "compassed with infirmity" (clothed with it); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</A>, "compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses").
<P> In Apocrypha we have "compassed about with yawning darkness" (The Wisdom of Solomon 19:17); "compassed the circuit of heaven" (Ecclesiasticus 24:5); "compassed with pomegranates of gold" (Ecclesiasticus 45:9); "The rainbow compasseth the heaven" (Ecclesiasticus 43:12); the course of the sun (1 Esdras 4:34).
