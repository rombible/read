( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Matthew+6:9-13" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+6:9-13&amp;t=niv">Matthew 6:9-13</a> ;  <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Luke+11:2-4" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+11:2-4&amp;t=niv">Luke 11:2-4</a> ) "In this prayer our Lord shows his disciples how an infinite variety of wants and requests can be compressed into a few humble petitions. It embodies every possible desire of a praying heart, a whole world of spiritual requirements; yet all in the most simple, condensed and humble form, resembling, in this respect, a pearl on which the light of heaven plays." --Lange. "This prayer contains four great general sentiments, which constitute the very soul of religion, --sentiments which are the germs of all holy deeds in all worlds. (1) <I>Filial reverence</I> : God is addressed not as the great unknown, not as the unsearchable governor, but as a father, the most intelligible, attractive and transforming name. It is a form of address almost unknown to the old covenant, now an then hinted at as reminding the children of their rebellion.

(2) "<I>Divine loyalty</I> : Thy kingdom come. (3) <I>Conscious dependence</I> : Give us this day, etc. (4) <I>Unbounded confidence</I> : For thine is the power, etc." --Dr. Thomas Genius of the Gospels. The doxology, "For thine is the kingdom" etc., is wanting in many manuscripts. It is omitted in the Revised Version; but it nevertheless has the authority of some manuscripts, and is truly biblical, almost every word being found in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/29-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/29-11.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 29:11</a> ) and is a true and fitting ending for prayer. </FONT></body></html>
