            <P><B>DARIC</B><P> dar'-ik (darkemon, and 'adharkon; dareikos):
<P> A Persian gold coin about a guinea or five dollars in value. The first form of the word occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+29:7" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Chronicles 29:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:69">Ezra 2:69</A>, and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:70-72">Nehemiah 7:70-72</A>; the second in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:27">Ezra 8:27</A> and is rendered, "dram" in the King James Version and "daric" in the Revised Version (British and American). In the passage in Chronicles, it must refer to a weight, since at the time of David there were no coins, but in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah the Persian darics were current.
