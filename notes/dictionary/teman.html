            <P><B>TEMAN</B><P> te'-man (teman, "on the right," i.e. "south"; Thaiman):
<P> The name of a district and town in the land of Edom, named after Teman the grandson of Esau, the son of his firstborn, Eliphaz (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:11">Genesis 36:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:36">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:36</A>). A duke Teman is named among the chiefs or clans of Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:42">Genesis 36:42</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:53">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:53</A>). He does not however appear first, in the place of the firstborn. Husham of the land of the Temanites was one of the ancient kings of Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:34">Genesis 36:34</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:45">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:45</A>). From Obad 1:9 we gather that Teman was in the land of Esau (Edom). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+1:12">Amos 1:12</A> it is named along with Bozrah, the capital of Edom. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+25:13">Ezekiel 25:13</A> desolation is denounced upon Edom: "From Teman even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword." Dedan being in the South, Teman must be sought in the North Eusebius, Onomasticon knows a district in the Gebalene region called Theman, and also a town with the same name, occupied by a Roman garrison, 15 miles from Petra. Unfortunately no indication of direction is given. No trace of the name has yet been found. It may have been on the road from Elath to Bozrah.
<P> The inhabitants of Teman seem to have been famous for their wisdom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+49:7">Jeremiah 49:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ob+1:8">Obadiah 1:8</A>). Eliphaz the Temanite was chief of the comforters of Job (2:11, etc.). The manner in which the city is mentioned by the prophets, now by itself, and again as standing for Edom, shows how important it must have been in their time.
