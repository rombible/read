            <P><B>BETH-DAGON</B><P> beth-da'-gon (bethdaghon; Bethdagon):
<P> (1) A town in the Shephelah of Judah named with Gederoth, Naamah, and Makkedah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:41">Joshua 15:41</A>). It may be represented by the modern Beit Dijan, about 6 miles Southeast of Jaffa. This however is a modern site, and not in the Shephelah. Nearly 2 miles to the south is Khirbet Dajan, a Roman site. The connection in which it occurs leads us to expect a position farther Southeast
<P> (2) A city on the border of Asher (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:27">Joshua 19:27</A>) which Conder would identify with Tell D'auk, near the mouth of the Belus, in the plan of Acre.
<P> The name seems to have been of frequent occurrence. There is a Beit Dejan about 6 miles East of Nablus, and Josephus speaks of a fortress called Dagon above Jericho (Ant., XII, viii, 1; BJ, I, ii, 3). This would seem to indicate a widespread worship of Dagon. But the name may mean "house of corn."
