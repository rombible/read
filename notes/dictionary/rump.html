<P> the King James Version uses this word as translation of 'alyah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+29:22">Exodus 29:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+3:9">Leviticus 3:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+7:3">7:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+8:25">8:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+9:19">9:19</A>), where the Revised Version (British and American) correctly renders "fat tail." Reference is here had to the broad tail of the Syrian sheep, which occasionally weighs as much as 20 lbs., and is considered one of the daintiest portions of mutton. It was one of those portions of the peace and trespass offering which were not eaten by the priest or the sacrificer, but which with other choice portions were waved before the Lord and wholly burnt on the altar as a sweet savor unto Yahweh.
