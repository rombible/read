The Hebrews as a pastoral and agricultural people, were not given to the sports of the field; the density of the population, the earnestness of their character, and the tendency of their ritual regulations, particularly those affecting food, all combined to discourage the practice of hunting. The smaller of catching animals was, first, either by digging a pitfall; or, secondly, by a trap which was set under ground, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/job/18-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/job/18-10.html">Job 18:10</a> ) in the run of the animal, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/22-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/22-5.html">Proverbs 22:5</a> ) and caught it by the leg, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/job/18-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/job/18-9.html">Job 18:9</a> ) or lastly by the use of the net, of which there were various kinds, as or the gazelle, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/51-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/51-20.html">Isaiah 51:20</a> ) Authorized Version, "wild bull," and other animals of that class. </FONT></body></html>
