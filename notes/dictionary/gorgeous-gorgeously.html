<P> Mikhlol occurs twice in the Old Testament, translated in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) "most gorgeously" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+23:12">Ezekiel 23:12</A>); in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+38:4">Ezekiel 38:4</A>, the King James Version translates "all sorts" (of armor), the Revised Version (British and American) "clothed in full armor." Lampros ("shining," "bright"), is only once translated "gorgeous" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:11">Luke 23:11</A>); "Herod .... arrayed him in a gorgeous robe," the Revised Version (British and American) "gorgeous apparel." We have also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+7:25">Luke 7:25</A>, "They that are gorgeously appareled ([~endoxos, "splendid," "glorious") .... are in kings' courts." They were scarcely to be looked for among the prophets, or in the new community of Jesus.
