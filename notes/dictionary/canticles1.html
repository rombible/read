             <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"><B>Canticles</B></FONT> <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">(<I>Song of Songs</I> ), entitled in the Authorized Version THE SONG OF <B><a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/smiths-bible-dictionary/solomon.html" target="_blank" url="solomon.html">SOLOMON</a></B>. It was probably written by Solomon about B.C. 1012. It may be called a drama, as it contains the dramatic evolution of a simple love-story. <I>Meaning.</I> -- The schools of interpretation may be divided into three: <I>the mystical</I> or <I>typical, the allegorical,</I> and <I>the literal</I> . <OL><LI>The <I>mystical</I> interpretation owes its origin to the desire to find a literal basis of fact for the allegorical. This basis is either the marriage of Solomon with Pharoahs daughter or his marriage with an Israelitish woman, the Shulamite. <LI>The <I>allegorical.</I> According to the Talmud the <I>beloved</I> is taken to be God; the <I>loved one</I> , or bride, is <I>the congregation of Israel</I> . In the Christian Church the Talmudical interpretation, imported by Origen, was all but universally received. <LI>The <I>literal</I> interpretation. According to the most generally-received interpretation of the modern literalists, the Song is intended to display <I>the victory of humble and constant love over the temptations of wealth and royalty.</I> <I>Canonicity.</I> -- The book has been rejected from the Canon by some critics; but in no case has its rejection been defended on <I>external</I> grounds. It is found in the LXX. and in the translations of Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion. It is contained in the catalog given in the Talmud,a nd in the catalogue of Melito; and in short we have the same evidence for its canonicity as that which is commonly adduced for the canonicity of any book of the Old Testament. </OL></FONT></body></html>
