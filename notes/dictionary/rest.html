            <P><B>REST</B><P> (nuach, menuchah, "cessation from motion," "peace," "quiet," etc.; anapausis, [@katapausis):
<P> "Rest" in the above sense is of frequent occurrence, and is the translation of several words with various applications and shades of meaning, chiefly of the words given above. It is applied to God as ceasing from the work of creating on the 7th day (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:2">Genesis 2:2</A>) ; as having His place of rest in the midst of His people in the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+28:2">1&nbsp;Chronicles 28:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+132:8,14">Psalms 132:8,14</A>); as resting in His love among His people (Zec 3:17, the Revised Version margin "Hebrew, `be silent' "). The 7th day was to be one of rest (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+16:23">Exodus 16:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+31:15">31:15</A>; see SABBATH); the land also was to have its rest in the 7th year (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+25:4">Leviticus 25:4</A>). Yahweh promised His people rest in the land He should give them; this they looked forward to and enjoyed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+12:9">Deuteronomy 12:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+11:23">Joshua 11:23</A>). "To rest on" often means to come upon to abide, as of the Spirit of Yahweh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:25">Numbers 11:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+11:2">Isaiah 11:2</A>), of wisdom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+14:33">Proverbs 14:33</A>), of anger (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+7:9">Ecclesiastes 7:9</A>). There is again the "rest" of the grave (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+3:13,17,18">Job 3:13,17,18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+57:2">Isaiah 57:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+12:13">Daniel 12:13</A>). Rest is sometimes equivalent to trust, reliance (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+14:11">2&nbsp;Chronicles 14:11</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "rely"). Hence, rest in Yahweh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+37:7">Psalms 37:7</A>, etc.); "rest" in the spiritual sense is not, however, prominent in the Old Testament. In the New Testament Christ's great offer is rest to the soul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+11:28">Matthew 11:28</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+4:1">Hebrews 4:1</A>, it is argued from God's having promised His people a "rest"--a promise not realized in Canaan (4:8)--that there remains for the people of God "a Sabbath rest" (sabbatismos, 4:9). For "rest" the Revised Version (British and American) has "solemn rest" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+16:23">Exodus 16:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+31:15">31:15</A>, etc.), "resting-place" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+132:8,14">Psalms 132:8,14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</A>), "peace" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</A>), "relief" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+2:13">2&nbsp;Corinthians 2:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+7:5">7:5</A>), etc.
