            <P><B>OBED-EDOM</B><P> o'-bed-e'-dom (`obhedh 'edhowm (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+25:24">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:24</A>), `obhedd 'edhom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:10">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+13:13,14">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:13,14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:25">15:25</A>), but elsewhere without hyphen, "servant of (god) Edom"; so W. R. Smith, Religion of Semites (2), 42, and H. P. Smith, Samuel, 294, though others explain it as = "servant of man"):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:10,11,12">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:10,11,12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+13:13,14">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:13,14</A> a Philistine of Gath and servant of David, who received the Ark of Yahweh into his house when David brought it into Jerusalem from Kiriath-jearim. Because of the sudden death of Uzzah, David was unwilling to proceed with the Ark to his citadel, and it remained three months in the house of Obed-edom, "and Yahweh blessed Obed-edom, and all his house" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:11">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:11</A>). According to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+13:14">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:14</A> the Ark had a special "house" of its own while there. He is probably the same as the Levite of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:25">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:25</A>. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:16-21">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:16-21</A> Obed-edom is a "singer," and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:24">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:24</A> a "doorkeeper," while according to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:4-8,15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:4-8,15</A> he is a Korahite doorkeeper, to whose house fell the overseership of the storehouse (26:15), while <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+16:5,38">1&nbsp;Chronicles 16:5,38</A> names him as a "minister before the ark," a member of the house or perhaps guild of Jeduthun (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+25:24">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:24</A>).
<P> Obed-edom is an illustration of the service rendered to Hebrew religion by foreigners, reminding one of the Simon of Cyrene who bore the cross of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:32">Matthew 27:32</A>, etc.). The Chronicler naturally desired to think that only Levites could discharge such duties as Obed-edom performed, and hence, the references to him as a Levite.
