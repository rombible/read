            <P><B>BINNUI</B><P> bin'-u-i (binnuy, a proper name, "a building up"):
<P> (1) A Levite, living in the time of Ezra (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:33">Ezra 8:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:9">Nehemiah 10:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:8">12:8</A>).
<P> (2) One of the bene Pachath-mo'abh who had taken foreign wives (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:30">Ezra 10:30</A>--Balnuus of 1 Esdras 9:31) and one of the bene Bani (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:38">Ezra 10:38</A>) who had also intermarried.
<P> (3) The son of Henadad, who built part of the wall of Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:24">Nehemiah 3:24</A>), and sealed the covenant with Nehemiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:9">Nehemiah 10:9</A>). In all probability he is identical with "Bavvai, the son of Henadad" mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:18">Nehemiah 3:18</A>. "Bavvai" is either a corruption of "Binnui," or is the name of the Levitical house of which Bavvai was the chief representative. Binnui is mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:9">Nehemiah 10:9</A> as a leading Levite, and, besides, the names in these verses are obviously those of priests and Levites; so the former theory is probably correct.
<P> (4) Head of a family who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:15">Nehemiah 7:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:10">Ezra 2:10</A>).
<P> H. J. Wolf
