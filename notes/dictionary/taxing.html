Two distinct registrations, or taxings, are mentioned in the New Testament, both of them by St. Luke. The first is said to have been the result of an edict of the emperor Augustus, that "all the world (i.e. the Roman empire) should be taxed," ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/2-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/2-1.html">Luke 2:1</a> ) and is connected by the evangelist with the name of Cyrenius Quirinus. [<B><a href="cyrenius.html" target="_blank" url="cyrenius.html">CYRENIUS</a></B>] The second and more important, ( Acts 6:37 ) is distinctly associated, in point of time, with the revolt of Judas of Galilee. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
