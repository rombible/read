<P> Appears only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:40">Acts 2:40</A>, the King James Version "Save yourselves from this untoward generation." It means "perverse," "willful," "crooked," and is so translated in Revised Version: "this crooked generation" (apo tes geneas tes skolias tautes). the King James Version headings to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28">Isaiah 28</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+6">Hosea 6</A> have "untowardness." This now obsolete term probably derived its orgin from the idea of the heart that was not inclined toward the divine will and teaching. Hence, "not-toward," or "untoward."
