Shaharaim and his descendants are listed with the descendants of Benjamin, though his relations to Benjamin are not stated.

<P> (3) The father of Maaseiah, who was one of the captains of hundreds associated with Jehoiada the priest in making Joash king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+23:1">2&nbsp;Chronicles 23:1</A>).

<P> (6) One of the men of Israel, not a priest or Levite, but "of the sons of Bani," who promised Ezra that he would part with his foreign wife (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:29">Ezra 10:29</A>).
<P> (7) The same man or another, in a different group of the sons of Bani (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:39">Ezra 10:39</A>).
<P> (8) One of the priests of the latest Bible times, mentioned with a partial genealogy (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:12">Nehemiah 11:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:12</A>).
