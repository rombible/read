<P> As is clear from references cited above, wells and springs were not sharply distinguished in name, though be'er, and phrear are used mainly of wells, and `ayin, ma`yan, motsa', mabbua` and (poetically) maqor are chiefly used of fountains. The Arabic bi'r, the equivalent of the Hebrew be'er, usually denotes a cistern for rain-water, though it may be qualified as bi'r jam`, "well of gathering," i.e. for rain-water, or as bi'r nab`, "well of springing water." A spring or natural fountain is called in Arabic `ain or nab` (compare Hebrew `ayin and mabbua`). These Arabic and Hebrew words for "well" and "spring" figure largely in place-names, modern and ancient:
<P> Beer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:16">Numbers 21:16</A>); Beer-elim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:8">Isaiah 15:8</A>), etc.; `Ain
<P> (a) on the northeast boundary of Palestine (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:11">Numbers 34:11</A>),
<P> (b) in the South of Judah, perhaps = En-rimmon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:32">Joshua 15:32</A>); Enaim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:14">Genesis 38:14</A>); Enam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:34">Joshua 15:34</A>), etc.
<P> Modern Arabic names with `ain are very numerous, e.g. `Ainul-fashkhah, `Ain-ul-chajleh, `Ain-karim, etc.
