It is mentioned in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/7-25.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/7-25.html">Judges 7:25</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/10-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/10-26.html">Isaiah 10:26</a> ) Perhaps the place called <I>Orbo</I> which in the <I>Bereshith Rabba</I> is stated to have been in the neighborhood of Bethshean, may have some connection with it. </FONT></body></html>
