            <P><B>AMBASSADOR</B><P> am-bas'-a-dor (mal'akh, "messenger"; 'luts, "interpreter"; tsir, "to go"; hence a messenger; presbeuo, "to act as an ambassador," literally, to be older):
<P> An ambassador is an official representative of a king or government, as of Pharaoh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+30:4">Isaiah 30:4</A>); of the princes of Babylon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+32:31">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:31</A>); of Neco, king of Egypt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+35:21">2&nbsp;Chronicles 35:21</A>); of the messengers of peace sent by Hezekiah, king of Judah, to Sennacherib, king of Assyria (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+33:7">Isaiah 33:7</A>). The same Hebrew term is used of the messengers sent by Jacob to Esau (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+32:3">Genesis 32:3</A>); by Moses to the king of Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:14">Numbers 20:14</A>). For abundant illustration consult "Messenger" (mal'akh) in any concordance. See
 <a href="concordance.html" target="_blank">CONCORDANCE</a>. The inhabitants of Gibeon made themselves pretended ambassadors to Joshua in order to secure by deceit the protection of a treaty ("covenant") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+9:4">Joshua 9:4</A>).
<P> In the New Testament the term is used in a figurative sense. As the imprisoned representative of Christ at Rome Paul calls himself "an ambassador in chains" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+6:20">Ephesians 6:20</A>); and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+5:20">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:20</A> includes, with himself, all ministers of the gospel, as "ambassadors .... on behalf of Christ," commissioned by Him as their sovereign Lord, with the ministry of reconciling the world to God. The Bible contains no finer characterization of the exalted and spiritual nature of the minister's vocation as the representative of Jesus Christ, the King of kings, and Saviour of the world.
