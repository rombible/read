            <P><B>HAVVOTH-JAIR</B><P> hav-oth-ja'-ir (chawwoth ya'ir "the encampments" or "tent villages of Jair"; the King James Version Havoth-Jair, ha-voth-ja'ir):
<P> The word chawwoth occurs only in this combination (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:41">Numbers 32:41</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:14">Deuteronomy 3:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+10:4">Judges 10:4</A>), and is a legacy from the nomadic stage of Hebrew life. Jair had thirty sons who possessed thirty "cities," and these are identified with Havvoth-jair in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+10:3">Judges 10:3</A>. The district was in Gilead (10:5; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:41">Numbers 32:41</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:13">Deuteronomy 3:13</A>, it is identified with Bashan and Argob; but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:13">1&nbsp;Kings 4:13</A>, "the towns of Jair" are said to be in Gilead; while to him also "pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars." There is evident confusion here. If we follow <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+10:3">Judges 10:3</A>, we may find a useful clue in 10:5. Kamon is named as the burial place of Jair. This probably corresponds to Kamun taken by Antiochus III, on his march from Pella to Gephrun (Polyb. v.70, 12). Schumacher (Northern `Ajlun, 137) found two places to the West of Irbid with the names Qamm and Qumeim (the latter a diminutive of the former) with ancient ruins. Qamm probably represents the Hebrew Qamon, so that Havvoth-jair should most likely be sought in this district, i.e. in North Gilead, between the Jordan Valley and Jebel ez-Zumleh.
