The first section opens with a magnificent description of the coming of Jehovah to judgment for the sins and idolatries of Israel and Judah, ch. 1:2-4, and the sentence pronounced upon Samaria, vs. 5-9, by the Judge himself. The sentence of captivity is passed upon them. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/2-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/2-10.html">Micah 2:10</a> ) but is followed instantly by a promise of restoration and triumphant return. ch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/2-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/2-12.html">Micah 2:12</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/2-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/2-13.html">Micah 2:13</a> ) The second section is addressed especially to the princes and heads of the people: their avarice and rapacity are rebuked in strong terms; but the threatening is again succeeded by a promise of restoration. In the last section, chs. 6,7, Jehovah, by a bold poetical figure, is represented as holding a controversy with his people, pleading with them in justification of his conduct toward them and the reasonableness of his requirements. The whole concludes with a triumphal song of joy at the great deliverance, like that from Egypt, which jehovah will achieve, and a full acknowledgment of his mercy and faithfulness of his promises. vs. 16-20. The last verse is reproduced in the song of Zacharias.

He it is who says that the Ruler shall spring from Bethlehem. ch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/5-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/5-2.html">Luke 5:2</a> ) His style has been compared with that of Hosea and Isaiah. His diction is vigorous and forcible, sometimes obscure from the abruptness of its transitions, but varied and rich. </FONT></body></html>
