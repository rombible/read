            <P><B>GALLIM</B><P> gal'-im (gallim), "heaps"):
<P> Probably two distinct places:
<P> (1) A town mentioned among the 11 additional cities of Judah which are in the Septuagint appended to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:59">Joshua 15:59</A>, and have altogether disappeared from the Hebrew text. It occurs between Karem (`Ain Kairem) and Baither (Bettir); it is probably the large and flourishing village of Beit Jala, near Bethlehem.
<P> (2) Gallim is mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:30">Isaiah 10:30</A>; not far from Laishah and Anathoth and certainly North of Jerusalem. It was the home of Palti the son of Laish (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25:44">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:44</A>), and it is by many authorities identified with the Gilgal on the North border of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:7">Joshua 15:7</A>), the Geliloth of the parallel passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:17">Joshua 18:17</A>), and the Beth-gilgal of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:29">Nehemiah 12:29</A>.
