<P> Thus spelled only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:9</A>; elsewhere "Raamah" (ra`mah). A son of Cush and father of Sheba and Dedan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:7">Genesis 10:7</A> = <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:9</A>). In Ezekiel's lament over Tyre (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:22">Ezekiel 27:22</A>) the tribe of Raamah is mentioned along with Sheba as a mercantile people who provided the inhabitants of Tyre with spices, precious stones and gold. It has generally been identified with Regina, mentioned by Ptolemy and Steph. Byzantr. as a city in Southeastern Arabia on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The Septuagint (Rhegma) itself supposes this site. But the Arabic name of the city here indicated is spelled with a "g" and so gives rise to a phonological difficulty. A more probable identification has been found in the Sabean ra`mah in Southwestern Arabia near Me`in in the north of Marib. Me`in was the capital of the old Minaean kingdom.
