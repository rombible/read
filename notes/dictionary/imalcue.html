            <P><B>IMALCUE</B><P> i-mal-ku'-e (Imalkoue; the King James Version Simalcue):
<P> An Arabian prince to whom Alexander Balas entrusted the upbringing of his young son Antiochus. Tryphon, who had formerly been on the side of Alexander, persuaded Imalcue to set up the young Antiochus (Antiochus VI) against Demetrius, who had incurred the enmity of his men of war (1 Macc 11:39,40). Antiochus confirmed Jonathan in the high-priesthood and appointed him to be one of the king's friends (11:57). In Josephus (Ant., XIII, v, 1) the name is given as Malchus.
