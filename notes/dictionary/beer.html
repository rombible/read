            <P><B>BEER</B><P> be'-er (be'er; phrear; Latin puteus = "well"):
<P> (1) A station on the march of the Israelites to the North of the Arnon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:16">Numbers 21:16</A>). Here it was that they sang round the well this song:
 - `Spring up O well; greet it with song, Well, that the princes have dug, The nobles of the people have bored, With the scepter--with their staves' (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:16">Numbers 21:16</A>).
 + The place is not identified.
<P> (2) The town to which Jotham fled from his brother Abimelech after declaring his parable from Mt. Gerizim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+9:21">Judges 9:21</A>). This may be identical with \BEEROTH\, which see.
