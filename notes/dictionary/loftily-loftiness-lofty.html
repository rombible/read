            <P><B>LOFTILY; LOFTINESS; LOFTY</B><P> lof'-ti-li, lof'-ti-nes:
<P> The first form is only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+73:8">Psalms 73:8</A>, where it means "haughtily," as if from on high. The second is found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:29">Jeremiah 48:29</A>, where the loftiness of Moab also means his haughtiness, his groundless self-conceit.
<P> Lofty likewise means '"haughty," "lifted up" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+131:1">Psalms 131:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+2:11">Isaiah 2:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:13">Proverbs 30:13</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+26:5">Isaiah 26:5</A> it refers to a self-secure and boastful city. In 57:15 it is used in a good sense of God who really is high and supreme. Isaiah uses the word more than all the other sacred writers put together.
