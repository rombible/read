            <P><B>NASBAS</B><P> nas'-bas (Nasbas, Codex Sinaiticus Nabad, read by Fritzsche):
<P> A name otherwise unknown. It occurs only in Tobit 11:18, "And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother's son," came to Tobit's wedding. Opinions are divided as to whether he was "brother's son" of Tobit or Achiacharus. the King James Version margin gives the suggestion of Junius, "Achiacharus who is also called Nasbas," thus identifying Nasbas with Achiacharus, which might gain support from Tobit 1:22 where Achiacharus is mentioned as "brother's son" of Tobit. See <a href="achiacharus.html" target="_blank">ACHIACHARUS</a>; <a href="aman.html" target="_blank">AMAN</a>. Codex Sinaiticus reads "Achiacharus and Nabad his brother's sons," which is corrected by another hand to "brother's son" (exadelphos). The Itala gives "Nabal avunculus ("maternal uncle") illius"; the, Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) "Nabath consobrini ("cousins") Tobiae"; Syriac "Laban his sister's son." This person is probably identical with the "Aman" of Tobit 14:10 (see variety of readings under AMAN) and the nephew in Harris' Story of Achiqar and His Nephew.
