Josephus calls it the capital of Peraea. The ruins of this city, now called <I>Um Keis</I> , are about two miles in circumference. The most interesting remains of Gadara are its tombs, which dot the cliffs for a considerable distance around the city. Godet says there is still a population of 200 souls in these tombs. Gadara was captured by Vespasian on the first outbreak of the war with the Jews, all its inhabitants were massacred, and the town itself, with the surrounding villages, was reduced to ashes. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
