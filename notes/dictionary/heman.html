            <P><B>HEMAN</B><P> he'-man (heman, "faithful"):
<P> The name of two men in the Old Testament.
<P> (1) A musician and seer, a Levite, son of Joe and grandson of the prophet Samuel; of the family of the Kohathites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:33">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:33</A>), appointed by David as one of the leaders of the temple-singing (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+5:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 5:12</A>). He had 14 sons (and 3 daughters) who assisted their father in the chorus. Heman seems also to have been a man of spiritual power; is called "the king's seer in matters of God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25:5">1&nbsp;Chronicles 25:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+35:15">2&nbsp;Chronicles 35:15</A>).
<P> (2) One of the noted wise men prior to, or about, the time of Solomon. He was one of the three sons of Mahol (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:31">1&nbsp;Kings 4:31</A>)); also called a son of Zerah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:6">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:6</A>).
<P><P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+88">Psalms 88</A> is inscribed to Heman the Ezrahite, who is probably to be identified with the second son of Zerah.
