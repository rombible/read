            <P><B>EN-</B><P> (`ayin (compare Arabic `Ain)):
<P> The Hebrew word for "spring" or "fountain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+16:7">Genesis 16:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:9">Numbers 33:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+2:14">Nehemiah 2:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+8:28">Proverbs 8:28</A> (feminine plural)). It occurs in numerous compound words, as EN-GEDI, EN-HADDAH, EN-HAKKORE, EN-HAZOR, EN-RIMMON, EN-ROGEL, EN-SHEMESH (which see). In the same way the word `Ain is a very common component of Arabic names of places throughout Palestine and Syria at the present day. Places with names compounded with "En-" were almost certainly located near a spring.
