            <P><B>KEREN-HAPPUCH</B><P> ker'-en-hap'-uk, ke'-ren-hap'-uk (qeren happukh, "horn of antimony," i.e. beautifier; Septuagint Amaltheias keras):
<P> The 3rd daughter of Job (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+42:14">Job 42:14</A>), born after his restoration from affliction. Antimony, producing a brilliant black, was used among the Orientals for coloring the edges of the eyelids, making the eyes large and lustrous? Hence, the suggestiveness of this name of an article of the ladies' toilet, a little horn or receptacle for the eye-paint.
