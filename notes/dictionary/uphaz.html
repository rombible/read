            <P><B>UPHAZ</B><P> u'-faz ('uphaz):
<P> A gold-bearing region, mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+10:9">Jeremiah 10:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+10:5">Daniel 10:5</A>, otherwise unknown. Perhaps in both passages Ophir, which differs in one consonant only, should be read. In the second passage, instead of "gold of Uphaz," perhaps "gold and fine gold" ('uphaz) should be read. The Jerusalem Talmud states that there were seven kinds of gold, good gold, pure, precious, gold of Uphaz, purified, refined, and red gold of Parvaim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+3:6">2&nbsp;Chronicles 3:6</A>). That of Uphaz, which is so called from the place from which it comes, resembles "flashes of fire fed with pitch" (M. Schwab, The Talmud of Jerusalem, V, 207 f).
