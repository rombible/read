            <P><B>BORROWING</B><P> bor'-o-ing:
<P> (1) In the Old Testament period loans were not of a commercial nature, i.e. they were not granted to enable a man to start or run a business. They were really a form of charity, and were made by the lender only to meet the pressure of poverty. To the borrower they were esteemed a form of misfortune (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+28:12">Deuteronomy 28:12</A>), and by the lender a form of beneficence. Hence, the tone of the Mosaic legislation on the subject.
<P> (2) Laying interest upon the poor of Israel was forbidden in all the codes (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:25">Exodus 22:25</A> (JE); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+23:19">Deuteronomy 23:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+25:36">Leviticus 25:36</A> H), because it was looked upon as making unwarranted profit out of a brother's distress:
<P> "If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest .... and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious."
<P> (3) The Law, however, allowed interest to be taken of a foreigner, or non-Jew (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+23:20">Deuteronomy 23:20</A>:
<P> "Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+15:3">Deuteronomy 15:3</A>); and even among Jews pledges were allowed under limitations, or taken against the law (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:10">Deuteronomy 24:10</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+24:2,3">Job 24:2,3</A> "There are that remove the landmarks .... they take the widow's ox for a pledge"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+15:1">Deuteronomy 15:1</A> there is a remarkable law providing a "release" by the creditor every "seven years," a "letting drop of loans" (see Driver in the place cited.). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+3:22">Exodus 3:22</A>, the King James Version "shall borrow" is rendered "shall ask" in the Revised Version (British and American).
