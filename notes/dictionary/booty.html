<P> "Booty" is the translation of baz or baz, usually rendered "prey" and "spoil" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+49:32">Jeremiah 49:32</A>); of malqoach, "prey," "booty" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:32">Numbers 31:32</A>, "the booty--the rest of the prey," the Revised Version (British and American) "the prey, over and above the booty," baz); of meshiccah, "spoil" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+2:7">Habakkuk 2:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+1:13">Zechariah 1:13</A>; the Revised Version (British and American) "spoil"); of opheleia, "gain" (2 Macc 8:20). "Booty respects what is of personal service to the captor; spoils whatever serves to designate his triumph; prey includes whatever gratifies the appetite and is to be consumed" (Crabb, English Synonymes). Persons (for slaves, etc.) might be part of the booty.
