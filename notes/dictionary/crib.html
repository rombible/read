            <P><B>CRIB</B><P> ('ebhuc):
<P> "Crib" translates the Hebrew word [~'ebhuc] exactly, as it denotes "a barred receptacle for fodder used in cowsheds and foldyards; also in fields, for beasts lying out in the winter." The Hebrew is from a word meaning to feed ('abhac), and is used in the precise sense of the English word in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:9">Job 39:9</A> of the "crib" of the wild ox, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+14:4">Proverbs 14:4</A>, "Where no oxen are, the crib is clean," and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+1:3">Isaiah 1:3</A>, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." section 23.
