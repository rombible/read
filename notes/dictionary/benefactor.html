            <P><B>BENEFACTOR</B><P> ben-e-fak'-ter (Greek euergetes, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+22:25">Luke 22:25</A>):
<P> There is here a probable allusion to two kings of Egypt (Ptolemy III and VII), who had the surname "Euergetes," of whom the period of the first was 247-242 BC, and of the second, 147-117 BC. Jesus draws the contrast between worldly kingdoms, in which the title "benefactor" is given those who rule with all the splendor of earthly display and luxury, and His kingdom, in which it belongs only to those whose work is that of humble, obscure and often menial service.
