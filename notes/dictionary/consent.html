            <P><B>CONSENT</B><P> kon-sent':
<P> The verb implies compliance with the guidance and direction of another, and, therefore, a secondary and subordinate relation of approval, sympathy and concurrence on the part of the one who consents. He does not take the initiative, but yields to what the principal proposes. The phrase ek sumphonou, "by consent," means "by mutual agreement" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+7:5">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:5</A>), both parties concerned being placed on an equality. "With one consent" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+3:9">Zechariah 3:9</A>, Hebrew "with one shoulder"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+14:18">Luke 14:18</A>) suggests, although it does not necessarily imply, the result of deliberation and consultation; it may have no other force than that of unanimity.
<P> H. E. Jacobs
