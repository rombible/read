There was a "garden," or rather orchard, attached to it, to which the olive, fig and pomegranate doubtless invited resort by their hospitable shade. And we know from the evangelists ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/22-39.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/22-39.html">Luke 22:39</a> ) And ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/18-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/18-2.html">John 18:2</a> ) that our Lord ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. But Gethsemane has not come down to us as a scene of mirth; its inexhaustible associations are the offspring of a single event--the agony of the Son of God on the evening preceding his passion. A garden, with eight venerable olive trees, and a grotto to the north detached from it, and in closer connection with the church of the sepulchre of the Virgin, are pointed out as the Gethsemane. Against the contemporary antiquity of the olive trees it has been urged that Titus cut down all the trees about Jerusalem. The probability would seem to be that they were planted by Christian hands to mark the spot unless, like the sacred olive of the Acropolis, they may have reproduced themselves. </FONT></body></html>
