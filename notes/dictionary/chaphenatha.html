            <P><B>CHAPHENATHA</B><P> ka-fen'-a-tha (Chaphenatha; the King James Version Caphenatha):
<P> A name apparently given to part of the eastern wall of Jerusalem or a fort in that neighborhood which is said (1 Macc 12:37) to have been repaired by Jonathan Maccabeus. The place cannot now be identified. Various speculations have been made as to the origin of the name, but they can hardly be said to throw any light on the passage cited.
