            <P><B>SION</B><P> si'-un (si'on; Seon):
<P> (1) A name given to Mt. Hermon in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+4:48">Deuteronomy 4:48</A>. The name may mean "protuberance" or "peak," and may have denoted the lofty snow-covered horn of the mountain as seen from the South. It may, however, be a scribal error for Sirion, the name by which the mountain was known to the Zidonians. Syriac takes it in this sense, which, however, may be a correction of the Hebrew. It is possible that this name, like Senir, may have applied to some distinct part of the Hermon Range.
<P> (2) Mt. Sion.
<P> See ZION.
