            <P><B>ABI-ALBON</B><P> ab-i-al'-bon, abi-al'-bon ('abhi `alebhon, meaning not known. Gesenius infers from the Arabic a stem which would give the meaning "father of strength," and this is at worst not quite so groundless as the conjectures which explain `alebhon as a textual misreading for 'el or ba`al):
<P> Abi-albon the Arbathite was one of David's listed heroes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:31">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:31</A>), called Abiel the Arbathite in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:32">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:32</A>. Presumably he was from Beth- arabah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:6,61">Joshua 15:6,61</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:22">18:22</A>).
