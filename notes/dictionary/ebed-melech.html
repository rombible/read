<P> An Ethiopian eunuch in the service of King Zedekiah, who interceded with the king for the prophet Jeremiah and rescued him from the dungeon into which he had been cast to die (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+38:7-13">Jeremiah 38:7-13</A>). For this, the word of Yahweh through Jeremiah promised Ebed-meleeh that his life should be spared in the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+39:15-18">Jeremiah 39:15-18</A>).
