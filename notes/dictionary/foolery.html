            <P><B>FOOLERY</B><P> fool'-er-i:
<P> The plural "fooleries" occurs Ecclesiasticus 22:13 King James Version:
<P> "Talk not much with a fool .... and thou shalt never be defiled with his fooleries." The Greek word is entinagmos, "a striking or throwing in," "an attack," from entinasso, "to strike into," "cast at," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ma+2:36">1&nbsp;Maccabees 2:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ma+4:41">2&nbsp;Maccabees 4:41</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ma+11:11">11:11</A>). the Revised Version (British and American) renders "Thou shalt not be defiled in his onslaught," margin "defiled: in his onslaught turn." The meaning is most probably "with what he throws out," i.e. his foolish or vile speeches, as if it were slaver.
