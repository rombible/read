            <P><B>HEALTH</B><P> helth (shalom, yeshu`ah, 'arukhah; riph'uth, 'arukhah; soteria, hugiaino):
<P> Shalom is part of the formal salutation still common in Palestine. In this sense it is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+43:28">Genesis 43:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+20:9">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:9</A>; the stem word means "peace," and is used in many varieties of expression relating to security, success and good bodily health. Yeshu`ah, which specifically means deliverance or help, occurs in the refrain of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+42:11">Psalms 42:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+43:5">43:5</A>, as well as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+67:2">Psalms 67:2</A>; in the American Standard Revised Version it is rendered "help." Riph'uth is literally, "healing," and is found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+3:8">Proverbs 3:8</A>. Marpe' also means healing of the body, but is used in a figurative sense as of promoting soundness of mind and moral character in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+4:22">Proverbs 4:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+12:18">12:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+13:17">13:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+16:24">16:24</A>, as also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+8:15">Jeremiah 8:15</A>, where the Revised Version (British and American) renders it "healing." 'Arukhah is also used in the same figurative sense in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+58:8">Isaiah 58:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+8:22">Jeremiah 8:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+30:17">30:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+33:6">33:6</A>; literally means "repairing or restoring"; it is the word used of the repair of the wall of Jerusalem by Nehemiah (chapter 4).
<P> The word "health" occurs twice in the New Testament:
<P> in Paul's appeal to his shipmates to take food (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:34">Acts 27:34</A>), he says it is for their soteria, literally, "safety"; so the American Standard Revised Version, the King James Version "health." The verb hugianino is used in 3<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:2">John 1:2</A>, in the apostle's salutation to Gaius.
<P> Alexander Macalister
