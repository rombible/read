            <P><B>EPHESIAN; EPHESIANS</B><P> e-fe'-zhan (Ephesios), e-fe'-zhanz:
<P> A term which, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:28,34,35">Acts 19:28,34,35</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:29">Acts 21:29</A>, was applied to those natives or residents of the city of Ephesus who were adherents of the cult of the goddess Diana. A Jew or a Christian, though a native of Ephesus, would probably have been designated as such, rather than as an Ephesian.
