There are no data from which to determine its date or place of writing, but it is placed about A.D. 65. The object of the epistle is plainly enough announced ver. 3; the reason for this exhortation is given ver. <OL><LI>The remainder of the epistle is almost entirely occupied by a minute depiction of the adversaries of the faith. The epistle closes by briefly reminding the readers of the oft-repeated prediction of the apostles --among whom the writer seems not to rank himself --that the faith would be assailed by such enemies as he has depicted, vs. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Jude+1:17-19" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jude+1:17-19&amp;t=niv">Jude 1:17-19</a> ) exhorting them to maintain their own steadfastness in the faith, vs. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-20.html">Jude 1:20</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-21.html">Jude 1:21</a> ) while they earnestly sought to rescue others from the corrupt example of those licentious livers, vs. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-22.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-22.html">Jude 1:22</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-23.html">Jude 1:23</a> ) and commending them to the power of God in language which forcibly recalls the closing benediction of the epistle to the Romans. vs. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-24.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-24.html">Jude 1:24</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-25.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-25.html">Jude 1:25</a> ) cf. Roma 16:25-27 This epistle presents one peculiarity, which, as we learn from St. Jerome, caused its authority to be impugned in very early times --the supposed citation of apocryphal writings. vs. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-9.html">Jude 1:9</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-14.html">Jude 1:14</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-15.html">Jude 1:15</a> ) The larger portion of this epistle, vs. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Jude+1:3-16" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jude+1:3-16&amp;t=niv">Jude 1:3-16</a> ) is almost identical in language and subject with a part of the Second Epistle of Peter.
