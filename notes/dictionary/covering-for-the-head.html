            <P><B>COVERING, FOR THE HEAD</B><P> kuv'-er-ing, (peribolaion):
<P> Mentioned in the New Testament only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+11:15">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:15</A>: "For her hair is given her for a covering," literally, "something cast round," probably equivalent to "veil" (which see). Read in the light of the context: "Every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head" (verse 5). The meaning would seem to be that Nature itself, in providing women with a natural veil, has taught the lesson underlying the prevailing custom, that woman should not be unveiled in the public assemblies.
<P> George B. Eager
