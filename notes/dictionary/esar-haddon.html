He appears by his monuments to have been one of the most powerful, if not <I>the</I> most powerful, of all the Assyrian monarchs. He is the only one of them whom we find to have actually reigned at Babylon, where he built himself a palace, bricks from which have been recently recovered bearing his name. His Babylonian reign lasted thirteen years, from B.C. 680 to B.C. 667; and it was doubtless within this space of time that Manasseh king of Judah, having been seized by his captains at Jerusalem on a charge of rebellion, was brought before him at Babylon, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/33-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/33-11.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 33:11</a> ) and detained for a time as prisoner there. As a builder of great works Esar-haddon is particularly distinguished. Besides his palace at Babylon, he built at least three others in different parts of his dominions, either for himself or his sons, and thirty temples. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
