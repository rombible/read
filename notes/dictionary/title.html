            <P><B>TITLE</B><P> ti'-t'-l:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+19:19,20">John 19:19,20</A> for titlos.
<P> The following arrangement of the title on the cross has been suggested:
<P> See Geikie, Life and Words of Christ, chapter lxiii, note e; Seymour, The Cross in Tradition, History and Art (New York, 1898), pp. 115, 116,136, 138.
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:17">2&nbsp;Kings 23:17</A>, the King James Version has "title" for tsiyyun. The word is connected with tsawah, "to command," and King James Version seems to have understood tsiyyun as "that giving directions," "sign-posts" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+39:15">Ezekiel 39:15</A>). The word, however, means "grave-stone," "monument."
<P> See SUPERSCRIPTION.
