            <P><B>AGUR</B><P> a'-gur ('aghur, seeming, from comparison with Arabic roots, to mean either "hireling," or "collector," "gatherer"):
<P> One of the contributors to Proverbs; his words being included in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30" target="_blank">Proverbs 30</A>. He takes an agnostic attitude toward God and transcendent things, and in general the range of his thought, as compared with that of other authors, is pedestrian. He shows, however, a tender reverence and awe. His most notable utterance, perhaps, is the celebrated Prayer of Agur (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:7-9">Proverbs 30:7-9</A>), which gives expression to a charming golden mean of practical ideal. His sayings are constructed on a rather artificial plan; having the form of the so-called numerical proverb. See under <a href="proverbs-the-book-of.html">PROVERBS, THE BOOK OF</a>, II, 6.
<P> John Franklin Genung
