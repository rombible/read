            <P><B>GUILE</B><P> gil (mirmah; dolos):
<P> "Guile" is twice the translation of mirmah, "fraud," "deceit" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+34:13">Psalms 34:13</A>, "Keep .... thy lips from speaking guile"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+55:11">Psalms 55:11</A>, "deceit and guile," the Revised Version (British and American) "oppression (margin "fraud") and guile"); once of `ormah, "craftiness," "guile" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:14">Exodus 21:14</A>); once of remiyah, "deception," "fraud" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+32:2">Psalms 32:2</A>, "in whose spirit there is no guile"); in the New Testament of dolos, "bait," hence, generally, "fraud," "guile," "deceit"; Septuagint for mirmah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</A>, English Versions of the Bible "deceit") and for remiyah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+13:7">Job 13:7</A>, English Versions of the Bible "deceitfully"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:47">John 1:47</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+12:16">2&nbsp;Corinthians 12:16</A>, "Being crafty, I caught you with guile"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:3">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:1">1&nbsp;Peter 2:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:22">2:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+3:10">3:10</A>, quoted from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+34:13">Psalms 34:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+14:5">Revelation 14:5</A>, "In their mouth was found no guile," the Revised Version (British and American) after corrected text, "no lie").
<P> Paul's words in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+12:16">2&nbsp;Corinthians 12:16</A> have sometimes been quoted in justification of "guile" in religious work, etc.; but he is not describing his actual procedure; but that which the Corinthians might have attributed to him; the lips of the Christian must be kept free from all guile (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+34:13">Psalms 34:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:1">1&nbsp;Peter 2:1</A>, etc.; The Wisdom of Solomon 1:5 "A holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit" (dolos), the Revised Version (British and American) "A holy spirit"). "Guile" does not appear in Apocrypha; dolos is frequently rendered "deceit."
<P> The Revised Version (British and American) has "guile" for "subtilty" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+27:35">Genesis 27:35</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:10">Acts 13:10</A>); "cover itself with guile" for "is covered by deceit" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+26:26">Proverbs 26:26</A>); "with guile" for "deceitfully" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+34:13">Genesis 34:13</A>); "spiritual milk which is without guile" for "sincere milk of the word," the English Revised Version, margin "reasonable," the American Revised Version, margin, Greek "belonging to the reason" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:2">1&nbsp;Peter 2:2</A>); "guileless" for "harmless" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</A>).
