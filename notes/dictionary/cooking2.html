Few animals were slaughtered except for purposes of hospitality or festivity. The proceedings on such occasions appear to have been as follows: --On the arrival of a guest, the animal, either a kid, lamb or calf, was killed, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/18-7.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/18-7.html">Genesis 18:7</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/15-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/15-23.html">Luke 15:23</a> ) its throat being cut so that the blood might be poured out, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/7-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/7-26.html">Leviticus 7:26</a> ) it was then flayed, and was ready for either roasting or boiling. In the former case the animal was preserved entire, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/12-46.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/12-46.html">Exodus 12:46</a> ) and roasted either over a fire, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/12-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/12-8.html">Exodus 12:8</a> ) of wood, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/44-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/44-16.html">Isaiah 44:16</a> ) or perhaps in an oven, consisting simply of a hole dug in the earth, well heated, and covered up. Boiling, however, was the more usual method of cooking. </FONT></body></html>
