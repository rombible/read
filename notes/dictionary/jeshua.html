<P> A place occupied by the children of Judah after their return from captivity (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:26">Nehemiah 11:26</A>), evidently, from the places named with it, in the extreme South of Judah. It may correspond with the Shema of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:26">Joshua 15:26</A>, and possibly to the Sheba of 19:2. The site may be Khirbet Sa`weh, a ruin upon a prominent hill, Tell es Sa`weh, 12 miles East-Northeast of Beersheba. The hill is surrounded by a wall of large blocks of stone. PEF, III, 409-10, Sh XXV.
