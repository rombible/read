            <P><B>RAISIN-CAKES</B><P> ra'-z'-n-kaks:
<P> the Revised Version (British and American) gives this rendering for the King James Version "foundations" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+16:7">Isaiah 16:7</A> (Hebrew 'ashishah from 'ashash, "to found," "make firm," "press"). The trade in these would cease through the desolation of the vineyards. For the King James Version "flagons of wine" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+3:1">Hosea 3:1</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) gives "cakes of raisins," such as were offered to the gods of the land, the givers of the grape (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+2:5">Song of Solomon 2:5</A>). See next article.
