            <P><B>ATAROTH</B><P> at'-a-roth, a-ta'-roth (`aTaroth, "crowns" or "wreaths"; Ataroth):
<P> (1) A city East of the Jordan, apparently in the territory given to Reuben, but built, or fortified, by the children of Gad (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:3,34">Numbers 32:3,34</A>). It is named along with Dibon, which is identified with Dhiban. Eight miles Northeast by North of Dibon, on the South of Wady Zerqa Ma`in, stands Jebel `Attarus, in which the ancient name is preserved. The city is doubtless represented by Khirbet `Attarus, about 4 miles West of the mountain.
<P> (2) A place on the boundary between Ephraim and Benjamin, toward the West (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+16:2">Joshua 16:2</A>). It seems to be the same as Ataroth- addar of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+16:5">Joshua 16:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:13">18:13</A>. It is probably to be identified with the modern ed-Dariyeh South of nether Bethhoron, and about 12 1/2 miles West of Jerusalem.
<P> (3) A place on the eastern frontier of Ephraim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+16:7">Joshua 16:7</A>). This town has not been identified. Conder thinks it may be identified with et-Truneh in the Jordan valley, or with Khirbet et-Taiyereh.
