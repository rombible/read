            <P><B>ASSEMBLY</B><P> a-sem'-bli (qahal; ekklesia):
<P> The common term for a meeting of the people called together by a crier. It has reference therefore to any gathering of the people called for any purpose whatsoever (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+12:6" target="_blank">Exodus 12:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+22:16">Psalms 22:16</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+89:7">Psalms 89:7</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:32,41">Acts 19:32,41</A>). The solemn assemblies of the Jews were their feasts or religious gatherings of any kind (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+1:13">Isaiah 1:13</A>). The word paneguris, "a general festal assembly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</A>), is transferred from the congregation of the people of Israel to the Christian church of which the congregation of Israel was a figure. In the same passage, ekklesia has the sense of calling, summoning. In classical Greek ekklesia was the name for the body of free citizens summoned by a herald. In this sense the church calls all the world to become identified with it. It denotes the whole body of believers, all who are called. Or it may refer to a particular congregation or local church (sunagoge, "synagogue" <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+2:2">James 2:2</A> the Revised Version, margin). See <a href="calling.html">CALLING</a>; <a href="church.html" target="_blank">CHURCH</a>; <a href="congregation.html" target="_blank">CONGREGATION</a>.
