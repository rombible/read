            <P><B>THERAS</B><P> the'-ras (Thera):
<P> The river by which the company assembled in preparation for the march to Jerusalem under Ezra (1 Esdras 8:41,61). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:21,31">Ezra 8:21,31</A> the name of the river is Ahava. Possibly the place is represented by the modern Hit on the Euphrates; but no certain identification is possible.
