<P> Both the verb and the nouns appear almost uniformly for yadhah, and eucharisteo, and their cognates. Eucharisteo is the usual Greek verb for "to thank," but yadhah takes on this force only through its context and is rather a synonym for "raise" or "bless" (which see) Septuagint renders yadhah usually by exomologeo, "speak forth together" "praise" (compare Tobit 12:20; Sirach 39:6, etc., and the use of "thank" in English Versions of the Bible to correspond), and this verb reappears in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+11:25" target="_blank">Matthew 11:25</A> parellel <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</A>, with English "thank" (the Revised Version margin "praise"). Compare the use of anthomologeomai (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</A>) and homologeo (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</A>, the King James Version "giving thanks," the Revised Version (British and American) "make confession"; the King James Version is preferable). For charis in the sense of "thanks" (note the singular "thank" in the King James Version Sirach 20:16; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:32-34">Luke 6:32-34</A>), see <a href="grace.html">GRACE</a>. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:19">1&nbsp;Peter 2:19</A> the King James Version has "thankworthy" for charis, the Revised Version (British and American) "acceptable," the Revised Version margin "grace."
