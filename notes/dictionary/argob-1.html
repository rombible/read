            <P><B>ARGOB (1)</B><P> ar'-gob ('argobh, "story"):
<P> A locality or a person mentioned in the obscure passage <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+15:25" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Kings 15:25</A>. The context deals with Pekah's conspiracy against Pekahiah; but it is not clear, owing to the state of the text, whether Argob and his associate Arieh (if these are the names of men) were officers of Pekahiah who were slain with him, or fellow- conspirators with Pekah. The vulg takes them as names of places; they may then be considered glosses that have crept into the text. Rashi holds that Argob was the royal palace. Argob is more likely the name of a place than a person. See <a href="arieh.html">ARIEH</a>.
