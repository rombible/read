<P> "Enmity" (hate) occurs as the translation of 'ebhah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</A>, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed," and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:21,22">Numbers 35:21,22</A>, where the absence of enmity on the part of the man-slayer modifies the judgment to be passed on him.
<P> In the New Testament "enmity" is the translation of echthra:
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:12">Luke 23:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</A>, "The mind of the flesh is enmity against God." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+4:4">James 4:4</A>, "The friendship of the world is enmity with God" (because "the world" is preferred to God); in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:15,16">Ephesians 2:15,16</A>, Christ is said to have "abolished in his flesh the enmity," by His cross to have "slain the enmity," that is, the opposition between Jew and Gentile, creating in Himself "one new man, (so) making peace."
