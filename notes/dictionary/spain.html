            <P><B>SPAIN</B><P> span (Spania):
<P> The country in the Southwest of Europe which still bears this name. It was Paul's purpose, as stated in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+15:24,28">Romans 15:24,28</A>, to visit Spain. If, as is probable, he ultimately carried out this intention, it must have been after a release from his first imprisonment. Clement of Rome speaks of the apostle as having reached "the extreme limit of the West" (Epistle of Clement, v).
<P> See PAUL, THE APOSTLE; TARSHISH.
