( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/job/28-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/job/28-18.html">Job 28:18</a> ) see also Prov 3:15; 8:11; 31:10 Some suppose "coral" to be in tended; others "pearl," supposing that the original word signifies merely "bright in color," or "color of a reddish tinge." (The real ruby is a red sapphire, next in value to the diamond. The finest rubies are brought chiefly from Ceylon and Burmah.) </FONT></body></html>
