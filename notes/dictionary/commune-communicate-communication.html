            <P><B>COMMUNE; COMMUNICATE; COMMUNICATION</B><P> ko-mun', komun'-i-kat, ko-mu-ni-ka'-shun:
<P> To commune is to converse confidentially and sympathetically. It is represented in both Hebrew and Greek by several words literally signifying to speak (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:11">Luke 6:11</A>, dialaleo; also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+22:4">Luke 22:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+24:26">Acts 24:26</A>, homileo). To communicate is to impart something to another, so that it becomes common to giver and receiver. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:18">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:18</A>, "willing to communicate" (the Revised Version, margin "sympathize"), represents a single word koinonikoi, and refers to the habit of sharing with others either sympathy or property. the Revised Version (British and American) gives "companionships" for homiliai in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:33">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:33</A> (the King James Version "communications").
