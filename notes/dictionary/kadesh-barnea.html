<P> Mentioned 10 times; called also "Kadesh" simply. The name perhaps means "the holy place of the desert of wandering." There are references to Kadesh in early history. At En-mishpat ("the same is Kadesh") Chedorlaomer and his allies smote the Amalekite and Amorite. Abraham dwelt near Kadesh, and it was at Beer-lahai-roi between Kadesh and Bered that the Angel of Yahweh appeared to Hagar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:7">Genesis 14:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+16:14">16:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+20:1">20:1</A>). It was an important camp of the Israelites during their wanderings, and seems to have been their headquarters for 38 years (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:2">Deuteronomy 1:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+2:14">2:14</A>; Judith 5:14). There the returning spies found the camp (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+13:26">Numbers 13:26</A>); there Miriam died and was buried (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:1">Numbers 20:1</A>); from thence messengers were sent to the king of Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:14">Numbers 20:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+11:16">Judges 11:16</A>). There the people rebelled because of the want of water, and Moses brought water from the rock (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:2">Numbers 20:2</A>); it was called therefore Meribath--or Meriboth-Kadesh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+27:14">Numbers 27:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:19">Ezekiel 47:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+48:28">48:28</A>). It was situated in the wilderness of Zin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:1">Numbers 20:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:36,37">33:36,37</A>) in the hill country of the Amorites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:19">Deuteronomy 1:19</A>), 11 days' journey from Horeb, by the way of Mt. Seir (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:2">Deuteronomy 1:2</A>), "in the uttermost" of the border of Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:16">Numbers 20:16</A>), and on the southern border, probably the Southeast corner, of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:19">Ezekiel 47:19</A>; compare Judith 19). See Cobern, Homiletic Review, April and May, 1914.
