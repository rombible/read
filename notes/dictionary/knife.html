            <P><B>KNIFE</B><P> nif:
<P> (1) ma'akheleth, literally, an instrument for eating; but used of large knives for slaying animals, cutting up a carcass or a sacrificial victim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+22:6,10">Genesis 22:6,10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+19:29">Judges 19:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:14">Proverbs 30:14</A>).
<P> (2) cherebh, rendered generally "sword," but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+5:2,3">Joshua 5:2,3</A> of stone knives for circumcision (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+4:25">Exodus 4:25</A>), probably of similar knives in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+18:28">1&nbsp;Kings 18:28</A>, used by Baal prophets in gashing themselves. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+5:12">Ezekiel 5:12</A> the King James Version, "knife," probably better the Revised Version (British and American), "sword."
<P> (3) ta`ar, usually rendered "razor," in combination with ha-copher, "knife of the writer," or "penknife" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+36:23">Jeremiah 36:23</A>).
<P> (4) machalaphim, "slaughter-knives" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:9">Ezra 1:9</A>).
<P> (5) sakkin, Aramaic, "knife" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+23:2">Proverbs 23:2</A>). Early knives were commonly made of sharp stones, especially of flint, later of bronze and iron. The-former remained in use in religious ceremonies long after the latter were in common use.
<P> Knives were not generally used at meals, meats being cut into bits before served, and bread being. broken into fragments. Herod used a knife for paring apples, and attempted suicide with the instrument (Josephus, Ant, XVII, vii, 1; BJ, I, xxxiii, 7).
