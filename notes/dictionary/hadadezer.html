<P> Mentioned in connection with David's wars of conquest (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:3">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+10:1-19">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:1-19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+18:3">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:3</A>); was king of Zobah in Syria. The exact position and size of this Syrian principality are uncertain, but it seems to have extended in David's time southward toward Ammon and eastward to the Euphrates. When the Ammonites had put themselves in the wrong with David by the insult done to his ambassadors (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+10:1-5">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:1-5</A>) they summoned to their aid against the incensed king of Israel the Syrians of various adjoining principalities, among them the Syrians of Zobah under Hadadezer, the son of Rehob. The strategy of Joab, who set the force under command of Abishai his brother in array against the Ammonites, and himself attacked the Syrian allies, won for Israel a decisive victory. Not content with this result, Hadadezer gathered together another Syrian force, summoning this time also "the Syrians that were beyond the River" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+10:16">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:16</A>), with Shobach the captain of his host at their head. On this occasion David himself took command of the Israelite forces and again defeated them near Helam, Shobach being left dead on the field. Hadadezer and his Syrian vassals, finding resistance hopeless, "made peace with Israel and served them" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+10:19">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:19</A>). For the name Hadador Hadarezer, see BENHADAD.
