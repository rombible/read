            <P><B>CELESTIAL</B><P> se-les'-chal (epouranios, "above the sky," "heavenly"):
<P> Peculiar to Paul's majestic argument on the resurrection: celestial verses terrestrial bodies (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:40">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:40</A>) with reference possibly to sun and moon, etc., but more probably to the bodies of angels in distinction from those of beasts and mortal men (compare Christ's words, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+22:30">Matthew 22:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</A>); including also doubtless in the apostle's thought the resurrection-body of Jesus and of the saints already taken-into glory. Light is thrown on its meaning by the rendering of the same Greek original as "heavenly places" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:3,20">Ephesians 1:3,20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:6">2:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+3:10">3:10</A>); "heavenly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:48">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:48</A>). Hence, "celestial" as used by Paul indicates the soul's continued life beyond the grave, the spiritual body of the redeemed in heaven, who, in Christ, have put on immortality.
