            <P><B>LICENCE</B><P> li'-sens:
<P> This word is not found at all in the Revised Version (British and American) (except in Judith 11:14; Ecclesiasticus 15:20; 1 Macc 1:13), and twice only in the King James Version (except in 2 Macc 4:9), both times in Acts. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:40">Acts 21:40</A> (as translation of epitrepo) the American Standard Revised Version has "leave" where the King James Version has "licence." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</A>, "opportunity to make his defense" (as translation of topon apologias) takes the place of "have licence to answer for himself."
