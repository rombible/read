            <P><B>JOHANAN</B><P> jo-ha'-nan (yochanan, "Yahweh has been gracious"; Ioanan; compare JEHOHANAN):
<P> (1) Son of Kareah, and one of "the captains of the forces who were in the fields" (i.e. probably guerrilla bands), who allied with Gedaliah, governor of Judah, after the fall of Jerusalem, 586 BC (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+25:23">2&nbsp;Kings 25:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+40:7-43:7">Jeremiah 40:7-43:7</A>). He warned Gedaliah of the plot of Ishmael ben Nethaniah, who was instigated by the Ammonite king Baalis, to murder the governor; but the latter refused to believe him nor would he grant Johanan permission to slay Ishmael (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+40:8-16">Jeremiah 40:8-16</A>). After Ishmael had murdered Gedaliah and also 70 northern pilgrims, Johanan went in pursuit. He was joined by the unwilling followers of Ishmael, but the murderer escaped. Thereupon Johanan settled at Geruth-Chimham near Bethlehem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+41">Jeremiah 41</A>). As Ishmael's plan was to take the remnant to the land of Ammon, so that of Johanan and his fellow-chiefs was to go to Egypt. They consulted the Divine oracle through Jeremiah, and received the answer that they should remain in Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+42">Jeremiah 42</A>). But the prophet was accused of giving false counsel and of being influenced by Baruch. The chiefs then resolved to go to Egypt, and forced Jeremiah and Baruch to accompany them (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+43">Jeremiah 43</A>).
<P> (2) The eldest son of King Josiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:15</A>), apparently = "Jehoahaz" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:30-33">2&nbsp;Kings 23:30-33</A>).
<P> (3) Son of Elioenai, and a Davidic post-exilic prince (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:24">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:24</A>).
<P> (4) Father of the Azariah who was priest in Solomon's time (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:9,10">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:9,10</A>; (Hebrew 5:35,36)).
<P> (5) A Benjamite recruit of David at Ziklag, but perhaps a Judean (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:4">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:4</A>)).
<P> (6) A Gadite recruit of David at Ziklag (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:12</A>)).
<P> (7) Hebrew has "Jehohanan," an Ephraimite chief (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+28:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:12</A>).
<P> (8) A returned exile (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:12">Ezra 8:12</A>) = "Joannes" (1 Esdras 8:38, the King James Version "Johannes").
<P> (9) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:22,23">Nehemiah 12:22,23</A> = JEHOHANAN, (3).
<P> David Francis Roberts
