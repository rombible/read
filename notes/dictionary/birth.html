            <P><B>BIRTH</B><P> burth (genesis):
<P> (1) It was said by the angel beforehand of John the Baptist, "Many shall rejoice at his birth"; and when he was born Elisabeth said, "Thus hath the Lord done unto me .... to take away my reproach among men" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:14,25">Luke 1:14,25</A>). Among the ancient Hebrews barrenness was a "reproach" and the birth of a child, of a son especially, an occasion for rejoicing.
<P> (2) This, no doubt, was due in part to the Messianic hope inspired and sustained by prophecy (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</A>, where it was foretold that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head; and subsequent prophecies too numerous to mention). Cases in point worth studying are found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+4:1">Genesis 4:1</A>, where Eve rejoices over the birth of her firstborn and cries, "I have gotten a man with the help of Yahweh"; and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:20">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:20</A>, where Hannah exults over her firstborn, calling his name "Samuel," "because," she says, "I have asked him of Yahweh."
<P> (3) The marvelous passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</A>, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel," must have intensified the longing and hope of every devout Jewish maiden to be a mother, if mayhap, under God, she might be the mother of Messiah--Immanuel! (Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+1:22,23">Matthew 1:22,23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:13">Luke 1:13</A> f.)
