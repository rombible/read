            <P><B>SUCCOTH (1)</B><P> suk'-oth, suk'-oth (cukkoth, "booths"; Skenai, Sokchoth, etc.):
<P> After parting with Esau, Jacob journeyed to Succoth, a name which he gave to the place from the "booths" which he erected to shelter his cattle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+33:17">Genesis 33:17</A>). It was in the territory of Gad, and is mentioned with Beth-nimrah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:27">Joshua 13:27</A>). In his pursuit of Zeba and Zalmunnah, Gideon seems to have retraced the path followed by Jacob, passing Succoth before Penuel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:5">Judges 8:5</A>). Their churlishness on that occasion brought dire punishment upon the men of Succoth. Gideon on his return "taught them" with thorns and briers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:16">Judges 8:16</A>). In the soil of the valley between Succoth and Zarethan, which was suitable for the purpose, the brass castings of the furniture for Solomon's Temple were made (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+7:46">1&nbsp;Kings 7:46</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+4:17">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:17</A>). Jerome (on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+33:17">Genesis 33:17</A>) says that in his day it was a city beyond Jordan in the district of Scythopolis. From the above data it is clear that Succoth lay on the East of the Jordan and North of the Jabbok. From <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+60:6">Psalms 60:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+108:7">108:7</A>, we may infer that it was close to the Jordan valley, part of which was apparently known by its name. Neubauer (Geog. du Talmud, 248) gives the Talmudic name as Tar`ala. Merrill (East of the Jordan, 386) and others compare this with Tell Deir `Alla, the name of an artificial mound about a mile North of the Jabbok, on the edge of the valley, fully 4 miles East of the Jordan. There is a place called Sakut West of the Jordan, about 10 miles South of Beisan. This has been proposed by some; but it is evident that Succoth lay East of the river. No trace of the name has been found here.
