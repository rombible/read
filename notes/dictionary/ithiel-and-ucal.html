            <P><B>ITHIEL AND UCAL</B><P> ('ithi'el we'ukhal):
<P> Names of the two men to whom Agur the son of Jakeh spoke his words (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:1">Proverbs 30:1</A>). The purport of introducing these persons is strange and obscure; the margin proposes therefore, by the use of a different pointing, to read the verse, "The man said, I have wearied myself, O God, I have wearied myself, O God, and am consumed," thus doing away with the proper names; a reading which corresponds not inaptly with the tone of the succeeding verses.
<P> See AGUR; PROVERBS, THE BOOK OF, II, 6.
<P> John Franklin Genung
