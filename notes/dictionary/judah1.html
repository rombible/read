(B.C. after 1753.) Of Judahs personal character more traits are preserved than of any other of the patriarchs, with the exception of Joseph, whose life he in conjunction with Reuben saved.

So too it is Judah who is sent before Jacob to smooth the way for him in the land of Goshen. ch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/46-28.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/46-28.html">Genesis 46:28</a> ) This ascendancy over his brethren is reflected in the last words addressed to him by his father. The families of Judah occupy a position among the tribes similar to that which their progenitor had taken among the patriarchs. The numbers of the tribe at the census at Sinai were 74,600. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/1-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/1-26.html">Numbers 1:26</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/1-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/1-27.html">Numbers 1:27</a> ) On the borders of the promised land they were 76,500.

On the east the Dead Sea, and on the west the Mediterranean, formed the boundaries. The southern line is hard to determine, since it is denoted by places many of which have not been identified. It left the Dead Sea at its extreme south end, and joined the Mediterranean at the <I>Wady el-Arish.</I> This territory is in average length about 45 miles, and in average breadth about 50. </FONT></body></html>
