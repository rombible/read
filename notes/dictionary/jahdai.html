<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:47">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:47</A>, where six sons of Jahdai are mentioned. "The name has been taken as that of another wife or concubine of Caleb; more probably Jahdai is a descendant of Caleb, whose name, in the original connection, has fallen from the text" (Curtis, Chronicles, 96).
