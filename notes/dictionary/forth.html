            <P><B>FORTH</B><P> forth:
<P> "Forth," adverb (from "for"), signifies movement
<P> (1) forward,
<P> (2) out of,
<P> (3) beyond a certain boundary.
<P> In a few instances in the Old Testament it is the translation of the preposition `al, properly "above," "upon" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+11:15">2&nbsp;Kings 11:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+23:14">2&nbsp;Chronicles 23:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+7:17">Amos 7:17</A> the King James Version), and of chuts, "without" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+39:13">Genesis 39:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+19:25">Judges 19:25</A>). "Forth" is often used as an expletive of various verbs, as "break (forth)," "bring (forth)," "call (forth)," etc. In the Gospel of John it is the translation of exo, "without," as "Lazarus, come forth" (11:43; so 15:6; 19:4 the King James Version, etc.; also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:34">Acts 5:34</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+9:40">9:40</A>). "Stand forth" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:3">Mark 3:3</A> is the translation of egeire eis to meson, margin "Arise into the midst." the Revised Version (British and American) has a great many changes, frequently substituting "out," "away," "abroad," etc.; "forth from" for "out of" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:21">Job 41:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</A>); "spread forth" for "stretched out" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+44:20">Psalms 44:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+88:9">88:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+136:6">136:6</A>), etc. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</A>, for "bringeth forth fruit" the Revised Version (British and American) reads "bearing fruit."
