            <P><B>SONS OF GOD</B><P> (Old Testament) (bene ha-'elohim, "sons of God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:2,4">Genesis 6:2,4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:6">Job 1:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+2:1">2:1</A>); bene 'elohim, "sons of God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:7">Job 38:7</A>); bene 'elim, "ye mighty," the King James Version; "ye sons of the mighty," King James Version margin, the Revised Version (British and American); "sons of God" or "sons of the gods," the Revised Version margin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+29:1">Psalms 29:1</A>); "sons of the mighty," the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American); "sons of God" or "sons of the gods," the Revised Version margin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+89:6">Psalms 89:6</A>)); Septuagint huioi tou theou, hoi aggeloi tou theou (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:2">Genesis 6:2</A>); huioi tou theou (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:4">Genesis 6:4</A>); hoi aggeloi tou theou (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:6">Job 1:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+2:1">2:1</A>); aggeloi mou (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:7">Job 38:7</A>); huioi theou (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+29:1">Psalms 29:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+89:6">89:6</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+3:25">Daniel 3:25</A>)):
<P> 1. Job and Psalms:
<P> This article will deal with this phrase as it is used in the above passages. In the passages from Job and Psalms it is applied to supernatural beings or angels. In Job the "sons of God" are represented as appearing before the throne of Yahweh in heaven, ready to do Him service, and as shouting for joy at the creation of the earth, In the Psalms they are summoned to celebrate the glory of Yahweh, for there is none among them to be compared to Him. The phrase in these passages has no physical or moral reference. These heavenly beings are called "sons of God" or "sons of the 'elohim" simply as belonging to the same class or guild as the 'elohim, just as "sons of the prophets" denotes those who belong to the prophetic order (see A.B. Davidson, Commentary on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+1:6">Job 1:6</A>).
<P> 2. Genesis 6:2,4:
<P> Different views, however, are taken of the passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:2,4">Genesis 6:2,4</A>:
<P> "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose ..... The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men."
<P> See GIANTS; NEPHILIM.
<P> (1) "Sons of God" is interpreted as referring to men,
<P> (a) to sons of the nobles, who married daughters of the common people. This is the view of many Jewish authorities, who hold that it is justified by the use of 'elohim in the sense of "judges" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:6">Exodus 21:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:8">22:8</A>, etc.). But this cannot be the meaning of 'elohim here, for when 'adham, "men," is used to denote the lower classes, it is contrasted with 'ish, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+49:2">Psalms 49:2</A> (Hebrew 3), not with 'elohim. When contrasted with 'elohim it signifies the human race.
<P> (b) Some commentators hold that by "sons of God" is to be understood the pious race descended from Seth, and by "daughters of men" the daughters of worldly men. These commentators connect the passage with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+4:25">Genesis 4:25</A>, where the race of Seth is characterized as the worshippers of Yahweh and is designated as a whole, a seed (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:1">Deuteronomy 14:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:5">32:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+1:10">Hosea 1:10</A> (Hebrew 2:1)). They consider the restricted meaning they put upon "men" as warranted by the contrast (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+32:20">Jeremiah 32:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+43:4">Isaiah 43:4</A>), and that as the term "daughters" expresses actual descent, it is natural to understand "sons" in a similar sense. The phrase "took wives," they contend also, supports the ethical view, being always used to signify real and lasting marriages, and cannot, therefore, be applied to the higher spirits in their unholy desire after flesh. On this view <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:1-4">Genesis 6:1-4</A> are an introduction to the reason for the Flood, the great wickedness of man upon the earth (6:5). It is held that nothing is said in 6:4 of a race of giants springing from the union of angels with human wives (see paragraph 2, below), and that the violence which is mentioned along with the corruption of the world (6:11) refers to the sin of the giants.
<P> (2) Most scholars now reject this view and interpret "sons of God" as referring to supernatural beings in accordance with the meaning of the expression in the other passages. They hold that <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:1">Deuteronomy 14:1</A>, etc., cannot be regarded as supporting the ethical interpretation of the phrase in a historical narrative. The reference to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+32:20">Jeremiah 32:20</A>, etc., too, is considered irrelevant, the contrast in these passages being between Israel and other nations, not, as here, between men and God. Nor can a narrower signification (daughters of worldly men) be attached to "men" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:2">Genesis 6:2</A> than to "men" in 6:1, where the reference is to the human race in general. This passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+6:1-4">Genesis 6:1-4</A>), therefore, which is the only one of its kind, is considered to be out of its place and to have been inserted here by the compiler as an introduction to the story of the Flood (6:5-8). The intention of the original writer, however, was to account for the rise of the giant race of antiquity by the union of demigods with human wives. This interpretation accords with Enoch chapters 6-7, etc., and with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</A>, where the unnatural sin of the men of Sodom who went after "strange flesh" is compared with that of the angels (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:4">2&nbsp;Peter 2:4</A>).
