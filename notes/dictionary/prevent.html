<P> "Prevent" occurs in the King James Version in the literal but obsolete sense of "to come or go before," "to anticipate," not in the sense of "to hinder." It is the translation of qadham, "to be sharp," "to be in front," "to be beforehand" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+22:6,19">2&nbsp;Samuel 22:6,19</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "came upon" <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+3:12">Job 3:12</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "receive"; 30:27, "are come upon"; 41:11, "first given"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:5,18">Psalms 18:5,18</A>, "came upon"; 21:3, the American Standard Revised Version "meetest"; 59:10, the American Standard Revised Version "meet"; 79:8, the American Standard Revised Version "meet"; 88:13, "come before"; 119:147,148, the American Standard Revised Version "anticipated"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+21:14">Isaiah 21:14</A>, "did meet"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+9:10">Amos 9:10</A>, the American Standard Revised Version "meet"). In the New Testament prophthano, with same meaning, is translated "prevent" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:25">Matthew 17:25</A>, "Jesus prevented him," the Revised Version (British and American) "spake first to him"); phthano (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+4:15">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:15</A>, "shall not prevent," the Revised Version (British and American) "shall in no wise precede"). "Prevent" in the above sense occurs in The Wisdom of Solomon 6:13, the Revised Version (British and American) "forestalleth" (phthano); 16:28, "we must prevent the sun to give thee thanks," the Revised Version (British and American) "rise before."
