            <P><B>RAIMENT, SOFT</B><P> (malakos):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+11:8">Matthew 11:8</A> English Versions of the Bible, where Jesus, speaking of John the Baptist, asks "What went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment?" where "raiment," though implied, is not expressed in the best text, but was probably added from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+7:25">Luke 7:25</A> parallel. It is equivalent to "elegant clothing," such as courtiers wore, as shown by the words following, "Behold, they that wear soft raiment are in kings' houses." John had bravely refused to play courtier and had gone to prison for it. In the early days of Herod the Great some scribes who attached themselves to him laid aside their usual plain clothing and wore the gorgeous raiment of courtiers (Jost, in Plumptre).
