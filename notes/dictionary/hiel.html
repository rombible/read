            <P><B>HIEL</B><P> hi'-el (chi'el; Achiel):
<P> A Bethelite who according to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+16:34">1&nbsp;Kings 16:34</A> rebuilt Jericho, and in fulfillment of a curse pronounced by Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+6:26">Joshua 6:26</A>) sacrificed his two sons. This seems to have been a custom prevalent among primitive peoples, the purpose being to ward off ill luck from the inhabitants, especially in a case where the destroyer had invoked a curse on him who presumed to rebuild. Numerous instances are brought to light in the excavations of Gezer (Macalister, Bible Side-Lights from the Mound of Gezer, chapter x). At first the very best was claimed as a gift to the deity, e.g. one's own sons; then some less valuable member of the community. When civilization prevented human sacrifice, animals were offered instead. The story of Abraham offering Isaac may be a trace of this old custom, the tenor of the story implying that at the time of the writing of the record, the custom was coming to be in disrepute. A similar instance is the offering of his eldest son by the king of Edom to appease the deity and win success in battle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+3:27">2&nbsp;Kings 3:27</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+6:7">Micah 6:7</A>). Various conjectures have been made as to the identity of this king. Ewald regarded him as a man of wealth and enterprise (unternehmender reicher Mann); Cheyne following Niebuhr makes it Jehu in disguise, putting <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+16:34">1&nbsp;Kings 16:34</A> after <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+10:33">2&nbsp;Kings 10:33</A>; Winckler explains as folklore.
