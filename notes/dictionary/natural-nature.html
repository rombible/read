            <P><B>NATURAL; NATURE</B><P> nat'-u-ral, na'-tur (leach; psuchikos, phusikos, phusis) :
<P> 1. As Used in the Old Testament:
<P> "Natural" is the translation of leach, "freshness or vigor" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+34:7">Deuteronomy 34:7</A>). Of Moses it is said, "His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated."
<P> "Nature" in the sense of a system or constitution does not occur in the Old Testament. The world and men, each individual, were conceived as being the direct creation of a supra-mundane God, and conserved by His power and Spirit. The later conception of "nature" came in through Greek influences.
<P> In the Apocrypha, we find "nature" in the sense of innate character or constitution (The Wisdom of Solomon 7:20, "the natures (phuseis) of living creatures"; The Wisdom of Solomon 13:1, "Surely vain are all men by nature" (phusei), 3 Macc 3:29, "mortal nature" (phusis)).
<P> 2. As Used in the New Testament:
<P> In the New Testament "nature" (phusis) is frequently found in the latter sense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</A>, "against nature"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</A>, "by nature"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:24">11:24</A>, also "contrary to nature"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+11:14">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:14</A>, "Doth not even nature itself teach you?"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+2:15">Galatians 2:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+4:8">4:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</A>; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+1:4">2&nbsp;Peter 1:4</A>, we have "that ye might be partakers of the divine nature," the Revised Version margin "or, a") ; phusis occurs also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:7">James 3:7</A>, "every kind of beasts," the Revised Version margin "Greek:
<P> nature," also "mankind" (3:7), the Revised Version margin "Greek: the human nature." "Natural" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:21,24">Romans 11:21,24</A>) is the translation of kata phusin, "according to nature." Paul in 1 Corinthians speaks of "the natural man" (2:14, the American Revised Version margin "or unspiritual, Greek: physical") and of a "natural body" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:44">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:44</A> twice), the Greek word being psuchikos, "of the soul" (psuche), the animal, natural, principle, as contrasted with what pertains to the higher principle of the spirit (pneuma). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:46">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:46</A> the contrast is expressed, "Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural," the American Revised Version margin "Greek: physical." The "natural man" is the man in whom the spirit is unquickened, the "natural body" is that corresponding to the psychical or soul-nature, the "spiritual body" that corresponding to the Spirit as the dominant principle of the life. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:10">Jude 1:10</A>, we have phusikos, "naturally" "naturally, as brute beasts," the Revised Version (British and American) "naturally, like the creatures without reason"; genesis, "origin," "birth," is translated "natural" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:23">James 1:23</A>, "his natural face," the Revised Version margin "Greek: the face of his birth"); and "nature" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:6">James 3:6</A>, "the course of nature" the Revised Version (British and American) "the wheel of nature" margin "or birth") ("wheel" probably means "circle of nature" (the whole creation; see COURSE)); gnesios, "genuine" ("true to right nature") "legitimate," "sincere," is translated "naturally" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:20">Philippians 2:20</A>, "who will naturally care for your state," the Revised Version (British and American) "truly," margin "Greek: genuinely").
