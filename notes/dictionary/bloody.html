            <P><B>BLOODY</B><P> blud'-i (dam = "blood" of man or an animal; and where the King James translators have rendered with the adjective "bloody," the Hebrew employs the noun in the construct case, "of blood"):
<P> "A bridegroom of blood" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+4:25,26">Exodus 4:25,26</A>, the King James Version bloody husband). Zipporah, not being an Israelite, probably objected to the circumcision of infants, if not to the rite altogether; apprehending, however, that her husband's life was imperiled possibly through some grievous sickness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+4:24">Exodus 4:24</A>) because of their disobedience in this particular, she performed the ceremony herself upon her son, saying, "A bridegroom of blood art thou to me."
<P> In the Revised Version (British and American) the expression (the King James Version "bloody") is variously rendered, "man of blood" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+16:7,8">2&nbsp;Samuel 16:7,8</A>); "men of blood" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+26:9">Psalms 26:9</A>); "bloodthirsty" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+5:6">Psalms 5:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+59:2">59:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+139:19">139:19</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:1">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:1</A>, "It is for Saul, and for his bloody house," might be rendered "Upon Saul and his house rests bloodshed."
<P> Ezekiel calls Jerusalem "the bloody city" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+22:2">Ezekiel 22:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+24:6">24:6</A>; compare
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+7:23">Ezekiel 7:23</A>), referring to those unjustly put to death by the wicked rulers of Jerusalem. Nineveh also is called "the bloody city" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=na+3:1">Nahum 3:1</A>). The capital here virtually stands for the kingdom, and history bears witness to the enormous cruelties perpetrated by the Assyrian rulers. It is siege on siege, pools of blood everywhere, the flaying of men alive, "great baskets stuffed with the salted heads of their foes." For two hundred years it is th e story of brute force and ruthless cruelty. "The prey departeth not." And now every cruelty which they have visited upon others is to be turned upon themselves (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=na+3:19">Nahum 3:19</A>).
