            <P><B>ELEALEH</B><P> e-le-a'-le ('el`aleh, "God has ascended"):
<P> Lay in the country taken from Sihon and within the lot given to Reuben (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:3,17">Numbers 32:3,17</A>). "Their names being changed" seems to apply to all the towns mentioned. There is no indication of the other names. Elealeh is noticed with Heshbon in the oracles against Moab in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:4">Isaiah 15:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+16:9">16:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:34">Jeremiah 48:34</A>. Eusebius (Onomasticon) locates it one Roman mile from Heshbon. It is represented today by el'Al, a mound crowned with ruins, about a mile North of Chesban.
