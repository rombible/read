            <P><B>KENEZITE</B><P> ke'-nez-it (qenizzi; Kenezaios):
<P> the King James Version in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+15:19">Genesis 15:19</A> and the Revised Version (British and American) uniformly, spell "Kenizzite." The Kenezites were the clan whose name-father was KENAZ (which see). Their land, along with that of their Canaanite tribes, was promised to Abram (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+15:19">Genesis 15:19</A>). To this clan belonged Jephunneh, the father of Caleb (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:12">Numbers 32:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+14:6,14">Joshua 14:6,14</A>). It had evidently been absorbed by the tribe of Judah. If the Kenezites went down with Jacob into Egypt, they may have become identified with his family there.
