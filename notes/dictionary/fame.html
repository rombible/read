<P> "Fame" has the twofold meaning, (1) of report or rumor, (2) of renown or reputation (in the Old Testament it is not always easy to distinguish the two senses). "Fame," shema`, "fame," "rumor," "reports" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+14:15">Numbers 14:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+28:22">Job 28:22</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "rumor") probably means "report"; but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:1">1&nbsp;Kings 10:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:1">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+66:19">Isaiah 66:19</A>, it is most probably "renown," or "reputation"; shemu`ah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:7">1&nbsp;Kings 10:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:6">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:6</A>) may have either meaning; shoma` (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+6:27">Joshua 6:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+9:9">9:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+9:4">Esther 9:4</A>) seems to mean "fame" in the sense of reputation; but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+6:24">Jeremiah 6:24</A> (as the American Standard Revised Version) "report"; shem, "name," has the sense of reputation (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:31">1&nbsp;Kings 4:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+14:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 14:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+22:5">22:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+3:19">Zechariah 3:19</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "name"); qol, "voice," is report (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+45:16">Genesis 45:16</A>, the American Standard Revised Version "report"). In the New Testament akoe, "hearing," is "report," so the Revised Version (British and American) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+14:1">14:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:28">Mark 1:28</A>); pheme, "word," "rumor," is report, fame in this sense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+9:26">Matthew 9:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+4:14">Luke 4:14</A>); echos, "a sound," "noise" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+4:37">Luke 4:37</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "rumor"), and logos, "word" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+5:15">Luke 5:15</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "report") have the same meaning; diaphemizo, "to say throughout," "to report publicly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+9:31">Matthew 9:31</A>, "they .... spread abroad his fame"), seems to imply fame in the sense of reputation.
<P> In 1 Macc 3:26, we have "fame" in the sense of reputation, "His fame (onoma, the Revised Version (British and American) "name") came near even to the king"; so 3:41, "heard the fame of them."
<P> ERV has "fame" for "report" (shema`), <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+50:43">Jeremiah 50:43</A>.
