            <P><B>REVIVE; REVIVING</B><P> re-viv', reviv'-ing:
<P> revive is the translation of chayah, "to live," "cause to live," used of restoration to life (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+45:27">Genesis 45:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+15:19">Judges 15:19</A>, etc.); of rebuilding (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+4:2">Nehemiah 4:2</A>); of restoration to well-being (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+85:6">Psalms 85:6</A> (the Revised Version (British and American) "quicken"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+138:7">Psalms 138:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+57:15">Isaiah 57:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+6:2">Hosea 6:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+14:7">14:7</A>); of Yahweh's gracious work for His people (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+3:2">Habakkuk 3:2</A>, "revive thy work in the midst of the years," etc.); "reviving" is the translation of michydh "preservation" or "means of life" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+9:8,9">Ezra 9:8,9</A>). "Revive" occurs in the New Testament as the translation of anazao, "to live again" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+7:9">Romans 7:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+14:9">14:9</A>, the King James Version "Christ both died, and rose, and revived," the Revised Version (British and American) (omitting "and rose") "Christ died and lived again" zao).
<P> In 1 Macc 13:7 the Revised Version (British and American) we have "And the spirit of the people revived," anazopureo, "to stir or kindle up as a fire," the same word as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:6">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:6</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "stir up the gift of God, which is in thee," margin "Greek:
<P> `stir into flame.'"
<P> In view of the frequent modern use of "revive" and "revival," it is worthy of notice that it is to Timothy himself the exhortation is addressed. We too often merely pray for "revivals," forgetting that it is for us to "stir into flame" the gift of the Spirit which we have already received of God. It is ours from Him, but we let it lie dormant, as a slumbering ember merely.
