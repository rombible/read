            <P><B>MASH</B><P> (mash):
<P> Named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:23">Genesis 10:23</A> as one of the sons of Aramaic In the parallel passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:17</A> the name is given as "Meshech" (meshekh), and the Septuagint (Mosoch) supports this form in both passages. "Meshech," however, is a Japhetic name (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:2">Genesis 10:2</A>), and "Mash" would seem to be the original reading. It is probably to be identified with the Mons Masius of classical writers (Strabo, etc.), on the northern boundary of Mesopotamia.
