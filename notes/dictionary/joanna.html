            <P><B>JOANNA</B><P> jo-an'-a (Ioana, or Ioanna):
<P> The wife of Chuzas, Herod's steward. She was one of the "women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities" which "ministered unto him (King James Version, i.e. Jesus, or "them" the Revised Version (British and American), i.e. Jesus and His disciples) of their substance," on the occasion of Jesus' tour through Galilee (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+8:2,3">Luke 8:2,3</A>). Along with other women she accompanied Jesus on His last journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, and was present when His body was laid in the sepulcher (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:55">Luke 23:55</A>). She was thus among those who prepared spices and ointments, who found the grave empty, and who "told these things unto the apostles" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:56-24:10">Luke 23:56-24:10</A>).
