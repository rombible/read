            <P><B>FREEWOMAN</B><P> fre'-woom-an (eleuthera):
<P> Found but 4 times in the King James Version (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+4:22,23,10,31">Galatians 4:22,23,10,31</A>). In the first three passages it refers to Sarah, the freewoman and true wife of Abraham as in contrast with Hagar, the Egyptian slave girl who became his concubine (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+16:1">Genesis 16:1</A>). In the last passage a metaphorical application of the term is made to the Christians who are the children of promise, of freedom, of the spirit, the children of the freewoman, in contrast with the Jews who are the children of the letter, of bondage, of the bondwoman.
