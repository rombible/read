            <P><B>PARE, (THE NAILS)</B><P> par (`asah, "to fix," "manipulate"):
<P> The word, which in Hebrew has a very wide range of application, and which is of very frequent occurrence in the Hebrew Bible, is found in the above meaning in but one passage of English Versions of the Bible (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+21:12">Deuteronomy 21:12</A>; see NAIL). In a similar sense it is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+19:24">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:24</A>, where it is used to express the dressing of the feet anti the trimming of the beard.
