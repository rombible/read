            <P><B>PIECE OF SILVER</B><P> Two words are thus rendered in the Old Testament (ratstse-khaceph, and qesiTah) and two in the New Testament argurion, and drachme). The first expression means pieces of silver broken off from bars or larger pieces (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+68:30" target="_blank">Psalms 68:30</A>). The second is used for money in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+24:32">Joshua 24:32</A>, and is so rendered in the Revised Version (British and American). The pieces were not coins, but perhaps bore a stamp. See <a href="money.html">MONEY</a>. In other passages of the Old Testament where pieces of silver are mentioned, the Hebrew has simply a numeral joined with keTeph, "silver," as in the account of the selling of Joseph (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+37:28">Genesis 37:28</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:23">Isaiah 7:23</A> the word silverlings means small pieces of silver, and they were no doubt shekels. In the New Testament the Greek arguria (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:15">Matthew 26:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:3-9">27:3-9</A>), is translated as pieces of silver, but probably means shekels. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</A> the same word occurs, but in this case the reference is probably to the denarius or drachma (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+15:8">Luke 15:8</A> f). Thus, the 30 pieces of Matthew would be equal to about 4 British pounds or  (in 1915), and the 50,000 of Ac to about 2,000 British pounds or ,000 (in 1915).
