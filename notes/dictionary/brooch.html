            <P><B>BROOCH</B><P> broch (chach):
<P> Used in plural by the Revised Version (British and American) (the King James Version "bracelets") for a class of "jewels of gold" brought as offerings by both men and women of Israel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+35:22">Exodus 35:22</A>). "Brooches," as Mackie says, is unoriental. The Hebrew word means most likely nose-rings.
