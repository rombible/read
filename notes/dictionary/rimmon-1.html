            <P><B>RIMMON (1)</B><P> rim'-on:
<P> (1) The rock Rimmon (cela` rimmon; he petra Rhemmon):
<P> The place of refuge of the 600 surviving Benjamites of Gibeah (Jeba`) who "turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:45,47">Judges 20:45,47</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+21:13">21:13</A>). Robinson's identification (RB, I, 440) has been very generally accepted. He found a conical and very prominent hill some 6 miles North-Northeast of Jeba` upon which stands a village called Rummon. This site was known to Eusebius and Jerome (OS 146 6; 287 98), who describe it as 15 Roman miles from Jerusalem. Another view, which would locate the place of refuge of the Benjamites in the Mugharet el jai, a large cavern on the south of the Wady Suweinit, near Jeba`, is strongly advocated by Rawnsley and Birch (see PEF, III, 137-48). The latter connects this again with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:2">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:2</A>, where Saul, accompanied by his 600, "abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah" under the pomegranate tree (Rimmon).
<P> (2) (rimmon; Eremmon, or Rhemmoth):
<P> A city in the Negeb, near the border of Edom, ascribed to Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:32">Joshua 15:32</A>) and to Simeon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:7">Joshua 19:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:32">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:32</A>, the King James Version "Remmon"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+14:10">Zechariah 14:10</A> it is mentioned as the extreme South of Judah--"from Geba to Rimmon, South of Jerusalem." In the earlier references Rimmon occurs in close association with `Ain (a spring), and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:29">Nehemiah 11:29</A>, what is apparently the same place, `Ain Rimmon, is called En-rimmon (which see).
<P> (3) (rimmon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:13">Joshua 19:13</A>), rimmonah, in some Hebrew manuscripts dimah (see DIMNAH) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:35">Joshua 21:35</A>), and rimmono (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:77">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:77</A>)):
<P> In the King James Version we have "Remmon-methoar" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:13">Joshua 19:13</A>, but the Revised Version (British and American) translates the latter as "which stretcheth." This was a city on the border of Zebulun (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:13">Joshua 19:13</A>) allotted to the Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:35">Joshua 21:35</A>, "Dimnah"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:77">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:77</A>). The site is now the little village of Rummaneh on a low ridge South of the western end of the marshy plain el Battauf in Galilee; there are many rock-cut tombs and cisterns. It is about 4 miles North of el Mesh-hed, usually considered to be the site of Gath-hepher. See PEF, I, 363, Sh VI.
