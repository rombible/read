            <P><B>ANTIPATRIS</B><P> an-tip'-a-tris (Antipatris):
<P> Is mentioned in Scripture only once, in connection with the descent of Paul from Jerusalem to Caesarea (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+23:31">Acts 23:31</A>). References will be found in Ant, XIII, xv 1; XVI, v, 2; BJ, I, xxi, 9. It was a town built by Herod the Great, and called after his father Antipater. It is probably identical with the modern Ras el-`Ain, "fountain head," a large mound with ruins at the source of Nahr el`Aujeh, in the plain to the Northeast of Jaffa. There are remains of a crusading castle which may be the Mirabel of those times.
