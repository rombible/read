They were allowed to glean in the fields, and to gather whatever the land produced in the year in which it was not tilled ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/19-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/19-10.html">Leviticus 19:10</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/25-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/25-5.html">Leviticus 25:5</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/25-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/25-6.html">Leviticus 25:6</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/24-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/24-19.html"> 24:19</a> ) They were also invited to feasts.

His land was in alienable, except for a certain term, when it reverted to him or his posterity. And if this resource were insufficient, he could pledge the services of himself and family or a valuable sum. Those who were indigent through bodily infirmities were usually taken care of by their kindred. A beggar was sometimes seen, however, and was regarded and abhorred as a vagabond.
