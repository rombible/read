            <P><B>BIBLE, THE, V INSPIRATION</B><P> $ V. Unity and Spiritual Purpose--Inspiration.$
<P> 1. Scripture a Unity:
<P> Holy Scripture is not simply a collection of religious books:
<P> still less does it consist of mere fragments of Jewish and Christian literature. It belongs to the conception of Scripture that, though originating "by divers portions and in divers manners" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</A>), it should yet, in its completeness, constitute a unity, evincing, in the spirit and purpose that bind its parts together, the Divine source from which its revelation comes. The Bible is the record of God's revelations of Himself to men in successive ages and dispensations (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:8-10">Ephesians 1:8-10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+3:5-9">3:5-9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+1:25,26">Colossians 1:25,26</A>), till the revelation culminates in the advent and work of the Son, and the mission of the Spirit. It is this aspect of the Bible which constitutes its grand distinction from all collections of sacred writings--the so-called "Bibles" of heathen religions--in the world. These, as the slightest inspection of them shows, have no unity. They are accumulations of heterogeneous materials, presenting, in their collocation, no order, progress, or plan. The reason is, that they embody no historical revelation working out a purpose in consecutive stages from germinal beginnings to perfect close. The Bible, by contrast, is a single book because it embodies such a revelation, and exhibits such a purpose. The unity of the book, made up of so many parts, is the attestation of the reality of the revelation it contains.
<P> 2. The Purpose of Grace:
<P> This feature of spiritual purpose in the Bible is one of the most obvious things about it (compare POT, 30). It gives to the Bible what is sometimes termed its "organic unity." The Bible has a beginning, middle and end. The opening chapters of Ge have their counterpart in the "new heaven and new earth" and paradise restored of the closing chapters of Revelation (21; 22). Man's sin is made the starting-point for disclosures of God's grace. The patriarchal history, with its covenants and promises, is continued in the story of the Exodus and the events that follow, in fulfillment of these promises. De recapitulates the lawgiving at Sinai. Jos sees the people put in possession of the promised land. Backsliding, rebellion, failure, do not defeat God's purpose, but are overruled to carry it on to a surer completion. The monarchy is made the occasion of new promises to the house of David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+7">2&nbsp;Samuel 7</A>). The prophets root themselves in the past, but, at the very hour when the nation seems sinking in ruin; hold out bright hopes of a greater future in the extension of God's kingdom to the Gentiles, under Messiah's rule. A critical writer, Kautzsch, has justly said:
<P> "The abiding value of the Old Testament lies above all in this, that it guarantees to us with absolute certainty the fact and the process of a Divine plan and way of salvation, which found its conclusion and fulfillment in the new covenant, in the person and work of Jesus Christ" (Bleibende Bedeutung des Altes Testament, 22, 24, 28-29, 30-31).
<P> Fulfilment in Christ.
<P> How truly all that was imperfect, transitional, temporary, in the Old Testament was brought to realization and completion in the redemption and spiritual kingdom of Christ need not here be dwelt upon. Christ is the prophet, priest and king of the New Covenant. His perfect sacrifice, "once for all," supersedes and abolishes the typical sacrifices of the old economy (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9-10">Hebrews 9-10</A>). His gift of the Spirit realizes what the prophets had foretold of God's law being written in men's hearts (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+32:39,40">32:39,40</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+11:19,20">Ezekiel 11:19,20</A>, etc.). His kingdom is established on moveless foundations, and can have no end (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:9-11">Philippians 2:9-11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+12:28">Hebrews 12:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</A>, etc.). In tracing the lines of this redeeming purpose of God, brought to light in Christ, we gain the key which unlocks the inmost meaning of the whole Bible. It is the revelation of a "gospel."
<P> 3. Inspiration:
<P> "Inspiration" is a word round which many debates have gathered. If, however, what has been said is true of the Bible as the record of a progressive revelation, of its contents as the discovery of the will of God for man's salvation, of the prophetic and apostolic standing of its writers, of the unity of spirit and purpose that pervades it, it will be difficult to deny that a quite peculiar presence, operation, and guidance of the Spirit of God are manifest in its production. The belief in inspiration, it has been seen, is implied in the formation of these books into a sacred canon. The full discussion of the subject belongs to a special article. (see <a href="bible-the-v-inspiration.html" target="_blank">INSPIRATION</a>). Biblical Claim.
<P> Here it need only be said that the claim for inspiration in the Bible is one made in fullest measure by the Bible itself. It is not denied by any that Jesus and His apostles regarded the Old Testament Scriptures as in the fullest sense inspired. The appeal of Jesus was always to the Scriptures, and the word of Scripture was final with Him. "Have ye not read?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+19:4">Matthew 19:4</A>). "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+22:29">Matthew 22:29</A>). This because "God" speaks in them (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+19:4">Matthew 19:4</A>). Prophecies and psalms were fulfilled in Him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+18:31">Luke 18:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+22:37">22:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+24:27,44">24:27,44</A>). Paul esteemed the Scriptures "the oracles of God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</A>). They are "God-inspired" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+3:16">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:16</A>). That New Testament prophets and apostles were not placed on any lower level than those of the Old Testament is manifest from Paul's explicit words regarding himself and his fellow-apostles. Paul never faltered in his claim to be "an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</A>, etc.)--"separated unto the gospel of God " (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</A>)--who had received his message, not from man, but by "revelation" from heaven (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+1:11,22">Galatians 1:11,22</A>). The "mystery of Christ" had "now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit," in consequence of which the church is declared to be "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+3:5">3:5</A>).
<P> Marks of Inspiration.
<P> It might be shown that these claims made by New Testament writers for the Old Testament and for themselves are borne out by what the Old Testament itself teaches of prophetic inspiration, of wisdom as the gift of God's spirit, and of the light, holiness, saving virtue and sanctifying power continually ascribed to God's "law," "words," "statutes," "commandments," "judgments" (see above). This is the ultimate test of "inspiration"--that to which Paul likewise appeals--its power to "make wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+3:15">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:15</A>)--its profitableness "for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+3:16">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:16</A>)--all to the end "that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+3:17">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:17</A>). Nothing is here determined as to "inerrancy" in minor historical, geographical, chronological details, in which some would wrongly put the essence of inspiration; but it seems implied that at least there is no error which can interfere with or nullify the utility of Scripture for the ends specified. Who that brings Scripture to its own tests of inspiration, will deny that, judged as a whole, it fulfils them?
<P> 4. Historical Influence of the Bible:
<P> The claim of the Bible to a Divine origin is justified by its historical influence. Regarded even as literature, the Bible has an unexampled place in history. Ten or fifteen manuscripts are thought a goodly number for an ancient classic; the manuscripts of whole or parts of the New Testament are reckoned by thousands, the oldest going back to the 4th or 5th century. Another test is translation. The books of the New Testament had hardly begun to be put together before we find translations being made of them in Latin, Syriac, Egyptian, later into Gothic and other barbarous tongues (see VERSIONS). In the Middle Ages, before the invention of printing, translations were made into the vernacular of most of the countries of Europe. Today there is not a language in the civilized world, hardly a language among uncivilized tribes, wherever missions have gone, into which this word of God has not been rendered. Thanks to the labors of Bible Societies, the circulation of the Bible in the different countries of the world in recent years outstrips all previous records. No book has ever been so minutely studied, has had so many books written on it, has founded so vast a literature of hymns, liturgies, devotional writings, sermons, has been so keenly assailed, has evoked such splendid defenses, as the Bible. Its spiritual influence cannot be estimated. To tell all the Bible has been and done for the world would be to rewrite in large part the history of modern civilization. Without it, in heathen lands, the arm and tongue of the missionary would be paralyzed. With it, even in the absence of the missionary, wondrous results are often effected. In national life the Bible is the source of our highest social and national aspirations. Professor Huxley, though an agnostic, argued for the reading of the Bible in the schools on this very ground. "By the study of what other book," he asked, "could children be so much humanized, and made to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession fills, like themselves, but a momentary space in the interval between two eternities, and earns the blessings or the curses of all times, according to its effort to do good and to hate evil, even as they are also earning their payment for their work?" (Critiques and Addresses, 61).
<P><P> $ VI. Addenda.$
<P> A few notes may be added, in closing, on special points not touched in the preceding sections.
<P> 1. Chapters and Verses:
<P> Already in pre-Talmudic times, for purposes of reading in the synagogues, the Jews had larger divisions of the law into sections called Para-shahs, and of the prophets into similar sections called HaphTarahs. They had also smaller divisions into Pecuqim, corresponding nearly with our verses. The division into chapters is much later (13th century). It is ascribed to Cardinal Hugo de St Caro (died 1248); by others to Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury (died 1227). It was adopted into the Vulgate, and from this was transferred by R. Nathan (circa 1440) to the Hebrew Bible (Bleek, Keil). Verses are marked in the Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A. D.) as early as 1558. They first appear in the New Testament in Robert Stephens' edition of the Greek Testament in 1551. Henry Stephens, Robert's son, reports that they were devised by his father during a journey on horseback from Paris to Lyons.
<P> 2. The King James Version and Revised Version:
<P> The King James Version of 1611, based in part on earlier English Versions, especially Tyndale's, justly holds rank as one of the noblest monuments of the English language of its own, or any, age. Necessarily, however, the Greek text used by the translators ("Textus Receptus"), resting on a few late manuscripts, was very imperfect. With the discovery of more ancient manuscripts, and multiplication of appliances for criticism, the need and call for a revised text and translation became urgent. Finally, at the instance of the Convocation of the Province of Canterbury, the task of revision was undertaken by Committees representing the best English and American scholarship. Their labors resulted in the publication, in 1881, of the Revised New Testament, and in 1885, of the Revised Old Testament (a revised edition of the Apocrypha was published in 1896). The preferencest of the American Revisers were printed in an appendix, a pledge being given that no further changes should be made for 14 years. The English Companies were disbanded shortly after 1885, but the American Committee, adhering to its own renderings, and believing that further improvements on the English the Revised Version (British and American) were possible, continued its organization and work. This issued, in 1901, in the production of the American Standard Revised Version, which aims at greater consistency and accuracy in a number of important respects, and is supplied, also, with carefully selected marginal references (see <a href="american-revised-version.html" target="_blank">AMERICAN REVISED VERSION</a>). Little could be done, in either the English Revised V ersion or the American Standard Revised Version, in the absence of reliable data for comparison, with the text of the Old Testament, but certain obvious corrections have been made, or noted in the margin.
<P> 3. Helps to Study:
<P> In recent years abundant helps have been furnished, apart from Commentaries and Dictionaries, for the intelligent study of the English Bible. Among such works may be mentioned the Oxford Helps to the Study of the Bible; the valuable Aids to Bible Students (Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1898); Dr. Angus' Bible Handbook (revised by Green); A. S. Peake's Guide to Biblical Study (1897); W. F. Adeney's How to Read the Bible (1896); R. C. Moulton's The Modern Reader's Bible (1907); The Sunday School Teachers' Bible (1875); The Variorum Reference Bible and Variorum Teachers' Bible (1880); Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech (1909); The Twentieth Century New Testament (Westcott and Hort's text, 1904); S. Lloyd's The Corrected English New Testament (Bagster, 1905).
