The distance between the two towns was about 16 miles. St. Paul, with Barnabas, sailed from Seleucia at the beginning of his first missionary circuit. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-4.html">Acts 13:4</a> ) This strong fortress and convenient seaport was constructed by the first Seleucus, and here he was buried.
