He ran along the ridge, cursing and throwing stones at the king and is companions. The next meeting was very different. The king was now returning from his successful campaign. Just as he was crossing the Jordan, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/19-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-samuel/19-18.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:18</a> ) the first person to welcome him was Shimei who threw himself at Davids feet in abject penitence. But the kings suspicions were not set at rest by this submission; and on his death-bed he recalls the whole scene to the recollection of his son Solomon. Solomon gave Shimei notice that from henceforth he must consider himself confined to the walls of Jerusalem, on pain of death.
