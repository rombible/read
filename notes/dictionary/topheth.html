            <P><B>TOPHETH</B><P> to'-feth (ha-topheth, etymology uncertain; the most probable is its connection with a root meaning "burning"--the "place of burning"; the King James Version, Tophet, except in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:10">2&nbsp;Kings 23:10</A>):
<P> The references are to such a place: "They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+7:31">Jeremiah 7:31</A>). On account of this abomination Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom should be called "The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury," the Revised Version margin "because there shall be no place else" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+7:32">Jeremiah 7:32</A>); see also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+19:6,12,13,14">Jeremiah 19:6,12,13,14</A>. Josiah is said to have "defiled Topheth" as part of his great religious reforms (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:10">2&nbsp;Kings 23:10</A>). The site of this shameful place would seem to have been either at the lower end of the Valley of Hinnom (see HINNOM, VALLEY OF), near where Akeldama is now pointed out, or in the open ground where this valley joins the Kidron.
