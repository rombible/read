            <P><B>BAAL-TAMAR</B><P> ba-al-ta'-mar ba`al tamar; Baal Thamar, ("Baal of the palm tree"):
<P> Evidently a seat of heathen worship (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:33">Judges 20:33</A>) between Bethel and Gibeah (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:18,31">Judges 20:18,31</A>). The place was known to Eusebius (Onomasticon, which see), but trace of the name is now lost. Conder suggests that it may be connected with the palm tree of Deborah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+4:5">Judges 4:5</A>) which was between Bethel and Ramah (HDB, under the word).
