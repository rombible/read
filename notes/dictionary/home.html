<P> This term in Scripture does not stand for a single specific word of the original, but for a variety of phrases. Most commonly it is a translation of the Hebrew bayith, Greek oikos "house," which means either the building or the persons occupying it. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+43:26">Genesis 43:26</A> "home" and "into the house" represent the same phase, "to the house" (ha-bayethah). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+1:21">Ruth 1:21</A>, "hath brought me home again" means "has caused me to return." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+25:10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:10</A> "home again" means "to their place." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+12:5">Ecclesiastes 12:5</A> "long home," the Revised Version (British and American) "everlasting home," means "eternal house." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+19:27">John 19:27</A> "unto his own home" means "unto his own things" (so <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:11">John 1:11</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+5:6">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:6</A> (and the Revised Version (British and American) 5:8,9) "be at home" is a translation of endemeo, "to be among one's own people," as opposed to ekdemeo, "to be or live abroad."
