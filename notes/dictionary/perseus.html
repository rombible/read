            <P><B>PERSEUS</B><P> pur'-sus, pur'-se-us (Perseus):
<P> In 1 Macc 8:5 the conquest of "Perseus, king of the Citims" (the Revised Version (British and American) "king of Chittim") was part of the "fame of the Romans" which reached the ears of Judas. This Perseus, the son and successor of Philip III of Macedonia, came to the throne in 178 BC and was the last king of Maccedonia. In 171 BC began the war with Rome which ended in his disastrous defeat and capture at Pydna, 168 BC (to which 1 Macc 8:5 refers), by L. Aemilius Paulus. Macedonia soon became a Roman province. Perseus was led to Rome to grace the triumph of his conqueror, by whose clemency he was spared, and died in captivity at Rome (Polyb. xxix. 17; Livy xliv. 40).
<P> Kittim or Chittim, properly of the people of the town of Citium in Cyprus, then signifying Cyprians, and extended by Jewish writers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:4">Genesis 10:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+24:24">Numbers 24:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+23:1">Isaiah 23:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+2:10">Jeremiah 2:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:6">Ezekiel 27:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+11:30">Daniel 11:30</A>; Josephus, Ant, I, vi) to include the coasts of Greece generally, is here applied to Maccdonia. In 1 Macc 1:1 Macedonia (or Greece) is called "the land of Chittim."
