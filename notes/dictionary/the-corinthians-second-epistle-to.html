The epistle was occasioned by the information which the apostle had received form Titus, and also, as it would certainly seem probable, from Timothy, of the reception of the first epistle. This information, as it would seem from our present epistle, was mainly favorable; the better part of the church were returning to their spiritual allegiance to the founder, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/1-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/1-13.html">2 Corinthians 1:13</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/1-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/1-14.html">2 Corinthians 1:14</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/7-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/7-9.html">2 Corinthians 7:9</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/7-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/7-15.html">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/7-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/7-16.html">2 Corinthians 7:16</a> ) but there was still a faction who strenuously denied Pauls claim to apostleship. The contents of this epistle comprise, (1) the apostles account of the character of his spiritual labors, chs. 1-7; (2) directions about the collections, chs. 8,9; (3) defence of his own apostolical character, chs. 10-13:10. The words in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-corinthians/5-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-corinthians/5-9.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 5:9</a> ) seem to point to further epistles to the church by Paul, but we have no positive evidence of any. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
