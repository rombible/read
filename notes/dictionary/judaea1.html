The word first occurs ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/daniel/5-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/daniel/5-13.html">Daniel 5:13</a> ) Authorized Version "Jewry," and the first mention of the "province of Judea" is in the book of Ezra, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/5-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/5-8.html">Ezra 5:8</a> ) It is alluded to in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/nehemiah/11-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/nehemiah/11-3.html">Nehemiah 11:3</a> ) (Authorized Version "Judah"). In the apocryphal books the word "province" is dropped, and throughout them and the New Testament the expressions are "the land of Judea," "Judea." In a wide and more improper sense, the term Judea was sometimes extended to the whole country of the Canaanites, its ancient inhabitants; and even in the Gospels we read of the coasts of Judea "beyond Jordan." ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/19-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/19-1.html">Matthew 19:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/10-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/10-1.html">Mark 10:1</a> ) Judea was, in strict language, the name of the third district, west of the Jordan and south of Samaria. It was made a portion of the Roman province of Syria upon the deposition of Archelaus, the ethnarch of Judea, in A.D. 6, and was governed by a procurator, who was subject to the governor of Syria. </FONT></body></html>
