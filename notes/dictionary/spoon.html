<P> A hollow vessel, a censer; a small vessel in which incense was to be burnt, as is seen from the account given in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+7">Numbers 7</A> of the oblations of the princes of the tribes after the setting-up of the tabernacle. Beginning with 7:14, we meet at every succeeding 6th verse the statement, "one golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense," till at 7:86 the summary statement is made, "the twelve golden spoons, full of incense."
