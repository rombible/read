<P> The translation of `elyon, used frequently of God and commonly translated "Most High" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:13">Psalms 18:13</A>, "The Highest gave his voice," the Revised Version (British and American) "Most High"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+87:5">Psalms 87:5</A>, "the highest himself," the Revised Version (British and American) "Most High"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:7">Ezekiel 41:7</A>, "the lowest (chamber) to the highest"); of tsammereth, the foliage of a tree (as if the wool or hair of trees), "the highest branch" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+17:3,12">Ezekiel 17:3,12</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "top," "lofty top"); of ro'sh, "head," "top" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+8:26">Proverbs 8:26</A>, "the highest part of the dust of the world," the King James Version margin "the chief part," the Revised Version (British and American) "the beginning of," margin "sum"); gappe marom, "on the ridges of the heights" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+9:3">Proverbs 9:3</A>, "the highest places of the city"); ghabhoah me`al gabhoah, literally, "one high (powerful) who is above the high (oppressor)," is translated "he that is higher than the highest" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+5:8">Ecclesiastes 5:8</A>), the Revised Version (British and American) "one higher than the high (regardeth)." In the New Testament, hupsistos (like `elyon) is used of God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:32">Luke 1:32</A>, "the Son of the Highest," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</A>, "the power of the Highest," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:76">Luke 1:76</A>, "the prophet of the Highest"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:35">Luke 6:35</A>, "the children of the Highest," in these places the Revised Version (British and American) has "Most High"); we have also "Hosanna in the highest" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:10">Mark 11:10</A>; see HOSANNA), "Glory to God in the highest" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</A>), "Glory in the highest" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:38">Luke 19:38</A>); protoklisia, "the first reclining-place" (at table), the chief place at meals, the middle place in each couch of the triclinium (Robinson), is rendered (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+14:8">Luke 14:8</A>), "the highest room," the Revised Version (British and American) "chief seat"; "room" was introduced by Tyndale; Wycliff had "the first place"; protokathedria (protos, "first," kathedra, "seat"), "the first or chief seat," is rendered (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+20:46">Luke 20:46</A>) "the highest seats," the Revised Version (British and American) "chief seats" Wycliff "the first chairs."
<P> "The Highest" as a term for God appears (2 Esdras 4:11,34, the Revised Version (British and American) "Most High"; The Wisdom of Solomon 6:3, hupsistos; Ecclesiasticus 28:7, the Revised Version (British and American) "Most High").
