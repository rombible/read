( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/2-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/2-1.html">Joshua 2:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/1-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/1-5.html">Matthew 1:5</a> ) (B.C. 1450.)
