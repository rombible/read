            <P><B>SELF-WILL</B><P> self-wil' (ratson; authades):
<P> Found once in the Old Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+49:6">Genesis 49:6</A>, "In their self-will they hocked an ox") in the death song of Jacob (see HOCK). The idea is found twice in the New Testament in the sense of "pleasing oneself": "not self-willed, not soon angry" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</A>); and "daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:10">2&nbsp;Peter 2:10</A>). In all these texts it stands for a false pride, for obstinacy, for "a pertinacious adherence to one's will or wish, especially in opposition to the dictates of wisdom or propriety or the wishes of others."elfare of his neighbor, just as Christ pleased not Himself (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+15:3">Romans 15:3</A>); also to leaders (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:16">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:16</A>), and to earthly rulers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</A>).
