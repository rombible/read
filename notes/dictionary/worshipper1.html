The <I>neocoros</I> was originally an attendant in a temple probably intrusted with its charge. The term <I>neocoros</I> became thus applied to cities or communities which undertook the worship of particular emperors even during their lives. The first occurrence of the term in connection with Ephesus is on coins of the age of Nero, A.D. 54-68. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
