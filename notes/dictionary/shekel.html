            <P><B>SHEKEL</B><P> shek'-'-l, shek'-el, she'-kel, she'-kul (sheqel):
<P> A weight and a coin. The Hebrew shekel was the 50th part of a mina, and as a weight about 224 grains, and as money (silver) was worth about 2 shillings 9d., or 66 cents (in 1915). No gold shekel has been found, and hence, it is inferred that such a coin was not used; but as a certain amount of gold, by weight, it is mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+3:9" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Chronicles 3:9</A> and is probably intended to be supplied in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+5:5">2&nbsp;Kings 5:5</A>. The gold shekel was 1/60 of the heavy Babylonian mina and weighed about 252 grains. In value it was about equal to 2 British pounds and 1 shilling, or about .00 (in 1915). See <a href="money.html">MONEY</a>; <a href="weights-and-measures.html" target="_blank">WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</a>. In the Revised Version (British and American) of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:27">Matthew 17:27</A> "shekel" replaces "piece of money" of the King James Version, the translation of stater.
