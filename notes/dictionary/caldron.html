            <P><B>CALDRON</B><P> kol'-drun (the rendering of qallachath, cir, dudh 'aghmon) :
<P> Qallachath is found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+2:14">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+3:3">Micah 3:3</A>. It is a pot for cooking, of undefined size and characteristics, in the former passage for sanctuary use, in the latter for domestic. Cir is translated caldron in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+1:13">Jeremiah 1:13</A> (Revised Versions); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+52:18">Jeremiah 52:18</A> f(the King James Version); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+11:3,7,11">Ezekiel 11:3,7,11</A>. It was distinctly a large pot, employed both for domestic use and in the sanctuary. Dudh is translated caldron only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+35:13">2&nbsp;Chronicles 35:13</A>. It was also a pot for cooking. 'Aghmon is translated caldron by the King James Version in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:20">Job 41:20</A>, but it is a mistranslation; the Revised Version (British and American) correctly has "rushes."
