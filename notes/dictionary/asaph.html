            <P><B>ASAPH</B><P> a'-saf ('acaph):
<P> Is the name of three men in the Old Testament, of whom one is the reputed author of Psalms 50 and 73-83. He was one of David's three chief musicians, the other two being Heman, and Ethan or Jeduthun, and we first hear of him when the ark was taken to Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:16-19" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:16-19</A>). He conducted with cymbals the music performed in the tent where the ark was housed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+16:4,5,7,37">1&nbsp;Chronicles 16:4,5,7,37</A>), while his two coadjutors discharged the same office at Gibeon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+16:41,42">1&nbsp;Chronicles 16:41,42</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25:1">1&nbsp;Chronicles 25:1</A> we are told that four of his sons were appointed to conduct under him detachments of the great chorus, the families of Heman and Jeduthun also furnishing leaders, and all took part at the dedication of the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+5:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 5:12</A>). A., H., and J. were called the king's seers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25">1&nbsp;Chronicles 25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+35:15">2&nbsp;Chronicles 35:15</A>), no doubt an official title of rank or dignity. The "Sons of Asaph" are mentioned in later times. They formed a guild, and played a prominent part at each revival of the national religion.
