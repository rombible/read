<P> These are undoubtedly identical with the Arabic `adas, a small, reddish bean, the product of Ervum lens, a dwarf leguminous plant, half a foot high, which is extensively cultivated in Palestine as a summer crop. The flour is highly nutritious, and the well-known food, Revalenta arabica, is simply one form, specially prepared; `adas are highly esteemed in Palestine, and are used in soup and as a "pottage" known as mujedderah. This last is of a reddish-brown color and is without doubt the "pottage" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:34">Genesis 25:34</A>. Lentils were part of the provisions brought to David when fleeing from Absalom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+17:28">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:28</A>) and were used in the making of the bread for the prophet Ezekiel (4:9). In a "plot of ground full of lentils," Shammah, one of David's "mighty men," stood and defended it and slew the marauding Philistines (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:11,12">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:11,12</A>).
