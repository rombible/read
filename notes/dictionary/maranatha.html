            <P><B>MARANATHA</B><P> mar-a-nath'-a, mar-an-a'-tha (from Aramaic words, marana' 'athah, "Our Lord cometh, or will come"; according to some, "has come"; to others, "Come!" an invitation for his speedy reappearance (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</A>); maranatha, or maran atha):
<P> Used in connection with anathema, "accursed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:22">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:22</A>), but has no necessary connection therewith. It was used by early Christians to add solemn emphasis to previous statement, injunction or adjuration, and seems to have become a sort of watchword; possibly forming part of an early liturgy.
