            <P><B>SHUAL, LAND OF</B><P> ('erets shu`al; he Sogal):
<P> From their encampment at Michmash the Philistines sent out marauding bands, one going westward toward Beth-horon, another eastward, "the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim." The pass to the South was held against them by Israel. The third party therefore went northward, turning "unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+13:17">1&nbsp;Samuel 13:17</A>). Ophrah is probably identical with et-taiyibeh, a village which lies some 5 miles East of Beitin (Bethel). It is in this district therefore that the land of Shual must be sought, but no definite identification is possible.
