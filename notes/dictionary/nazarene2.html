This appellative is applied to,Jesus in many passages in the New Testament. This name, made striking in so many ways, and which, if first given in scorn, was adopted and gloried in by the disciples, we are told in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/2-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/2-23.html">Matthew 2:23</a> ) possesses a prophetic significance. Its application to Jesus, in consequence of the providential arrangements by which his Parents were led to take up their abode in Nazareth, was the filling out of the predictions in which the promised Messiah is described as a <I>netser</I> i.e. a <I>shoot, sprout</I> , of Jesse, a humble and despised descendant of the decayed royal family. Once, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/24-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/24-5.html">Acts 24:5</a> ) the term Nazarenes is applied to the followers of Jesus by way of contempt. The name still exists in Arabic as the ordinary designation of Christians. </FONT></body></html>
