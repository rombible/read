            <P><B>GERUTH CHIMHAM</B><P> ge'-rooth kim'-ham (geruth kimham):
<P> If the reading geruth is correct, a "lodging-place" or "khan" on the highway to Egypt, may be meant (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+41:17">Jeremiah 41:17</A>). It may have been built by Chimham son of Barzillai; or it may have been named from him as owner of the land on which it stood. But probably with Josephus we should read gidhroth, "hurdles" or "sheep pens" (Ant., X, ix, 5).
