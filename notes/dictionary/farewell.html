            <P><B>FAREWELL</B><P> far-wel' (chairo), Fare ye, or thou, well:
<P> Originally a wish at parting for those faring forth (traveling):
<P> (1) As a parting wish at the close of a letter it represents the Greek err(h)oso, "Be strong," imperative of rhonnumi, "to make strong" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+23:30">23:30</A> the King James Version; see the Revised Version, margin; 2 Macc 11:21); once chairete (imperative of chairo), "Rejoice!" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+13:11">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:11</A>, the Revised Version, margin "Rejoice:
<P> be perfected").
<P> (2) As equivalent to our saying "good-bye," it represents the Greek apotassomai, "to separate one's self," "to take leave," "to bid farewell" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+9:61">Luke 9:61</A>, "to bid farewell to them that are at my house"; Ac 18:21, "bade them farewell," the Revised Version (British and American) "taking his leave of them").
<P> See FARE; GREETING.
