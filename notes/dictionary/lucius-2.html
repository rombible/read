            <P><B>LUCIUS (2)</B><P> (Loukios):
<P> This name is mentioned twice:
<P> (1) In the church at Antioch which sent out Barnabas and Saul as its missionaries were several prophets and teachers, among whom was Lucius of Cyrene (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</A>). He was probably one of those "men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+11:20">Acts 11:20</A>). It has been suggested that he is the same as Luke, but this is merely conjecture.
<P> (2) "Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen" were among those who joined Paul in saluting the Christians in Rome (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:21">Romans 16:21</A>). By "kinsmen" Paul means "Jews" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:11,21">16:11,21</A>). This Lucius may have been the same person as (1), but, as we have no more information about either, we cannot determine this.
