            <P><B>TRYPHAENA</B><P> tri-fe'-na (Truphaina; the King James Version, Tryphena):
<P> Tryphaena is coupled with "Tryphosa"--among those members of the Christian community at Rome to whom Paul sends greetings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:12">Romans 16:12</A>). He describes them as those "who labor in the Lord." "The names, which might be rendered `Dainty' and `Disdain' (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+5:5">James 5:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+66:11">Isaiah 66:11</A>), are characteristically pagan, and unlike the description" (Denney). They were probably sisters or near relatives, for "it was usual to designate members of the same family by derivatives of the same root" (Lightfoot, Phil, 175). Both names are found in inscriptions connected with the imperial household, "Tryphosa" occurring more frequently than "Tryphaena."
