            <P><B>ANEM</B><P> a'-nem (`anem, "two springs"; Anam):
<P> Anem is mentioned with Ramoth among the cities of Issachar assigned to the priests, the sons of Gershom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:73">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:73</A>). In the parallel list (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:29">Joshua 21:29</A>), there are mentioned Jarmuth and En- gannim, corresponding to Ramoth and Anim, therefore Anim and En-gannim (Jenin) are identical. As the name denotes (Anem = "two springs"; En-gannim = "the spring of gardens"), it was well watered. Anem is identified by Eusebius with Aner, but Conder suggests the village of "Anim," on the hills West of the plain of Esdraelon which represents the Anea of the 4th century AD (Onom under the word "Aniel" and "Bethara"), a city lying 15 Roman miles from Caesarea, which had good baths.
