<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+32:10,11,12,14,16,44">Jeremiah 32:10,11,12,14,16,44</A>, cepher, "a writing," is translated (the King James Version) "evidence" (of the purchase of the field in Anathoth), the Revised Version (British and American) "deed"; "evidence" is also the translation of elegchos, "conviction," in the King James Version of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</A>, "Now faith is .... the evidence of things not seen," the English Revised Version "proving," margin, "or test," better, as the American Standard Revised Version, "conviction," margin, "or test." The Greek word denotes "putting to the test," examining for the purpose of proof, bringing to conviction (Dr. W. F. Moulton). Thus if "test" or "proving" be adopted, a firm conviction of the reality of things not seen is implied as the result of putting to the proof. Trench remarks (New Testament Synonyms), "in juristic Greek elegchein is not merely to reply to, but to refute, an opponent." Hence, the Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.) translation argumentum, followed by Wyclif and Rheims version; Tyndale and Cranmer have "certayntie." (The sense of "conviction" appears in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+8:46">John 8:46</A>, "Which of you convinceth (elegchei, the Revised Version (British and American) "convicteth") me of sin?"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+3:20">John 3:20</A>, "reproved," the Revised Version, margin "convicted"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+16:8">John 16:8</A> the King James Version "He will reprove the world of sin," the Revised Version (British and American) "convict." Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:24">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:24</A>.) "Evident" is the translation of `al panim ("on the face") in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+6:28">Job 6:28</A>, the King James Version "Look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie," margin, "Hebrew before your face," the Revised Version (British and American) "to your face," margin, "And it will be evident unto you if I lie," which is, perhaps, to be preferred to the text; delos, "manifest," is translated "evident" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</A>); katadelos, "very manifest," is in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+7:15">Hebrews 7:15</A>, the King James Version "far more evident," the Revised Version (British and American) "more abundantly evident"; prodelos, "manifest before-hand" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+7:14">Hebrews 7:14</A>), "evident." "Evidently" occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</A>, as the translation of phaneros, "openly," "manifestly," the Revised Version (British and American) "openly."
<P> It is important to note the true nature of faith according to the correct translation of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</A>, as being the well- grounded and assured conviction of things not seen.
<P> W. L. Walker
