<P> In modern English means "a tiny flask." The word appears in English Versions of the Bible <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+10:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:1</A> and the Revised Version (British and American) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+9:1,3">2&nbsp;Kings 9:1,3</A> (the King James Version "box") for pakh, a word found nowhere else and from a root meaning "to pour." The shape and size of the pakh are quite uncertain. In 1 Esdras 2:13; and the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</A>, etc., "vial" translates phiale. The phiale was a flat, shallow bowl (Latin, patera), shaped much like a saucer. Hence, the Revised Version's change to "bowl" in Revelation, a change that should have been made in 1 Esdras also.
