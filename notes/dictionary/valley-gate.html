            <P><B>VALLEY GATE</B><P> (sha`ar ha-gay', "Gate of the Gai"):
<P> Is placed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:13">Nehemiah 3:13</A>) between the "tower of the furnaces" and the "dung gate"; from here Nehemiah (2:13) set out on his ride down the "Gai" (Hinnom) to Siloam, and, too (12:31,38), from here the Levites commenced their compass of the city in two directions. It must have been an ancient gate, for Uzziah added towers to it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+26:9">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:9</A>). It was probably near the Southwest corner of the city and near to, if not identical with, the gate found by Bliss near (now in) the Protestant Cemetery.
<P> See JERUSALEM, VI, 13.
