            <P><B>AEDIAS</B><P> a-e-di'-as (Aedeias). Mentioned in 1 Esdras 9:27, being one of those who agreed to divorce their alien wives. This name is supposed to be a corruption of the Greek Helia, there being no Hebrew equivalent for it, and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:26">Ezra 10:26</A>, the name occurs in the correct form as Elijah ('eliyah = "God is Yahweh").
