It is the translation of hupselophroneo, "to be highminded," "proud," "haughty" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:20">Romans 11:20</A>, "Be not highminded, but fear"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:17">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:17</A>, "Charge them that are rich .... that they be not highminded"); of tuphoo "to wrap in mist or smoke," trop., to wrap in conceit, to make proud, etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+3:4">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:4</A>, "Traitors, heady, highminded," the Revised Version (British and American) "puffed up"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+3:6">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:4">6:4</A>). "No one can be highminded without thinking better of himself, and worse of others, than he ought to think" (Crabb, English Synonyms).
