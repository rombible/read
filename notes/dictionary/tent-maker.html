<P> Mentioned only once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</A>). Paul's native province of Cilicia was noted for its goats' hair cloth which was exported under the name of cilicium and was used largely for tentmaking. We are told in the passage mentioned that Paul dwelt with Aquila and Priscilla, and worked with them at tent-making (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</A>).
