            <P><B>JAHZEIAH</B><P> ja-ze'-ya, ja'-ze-ya (yachzeyah, "Yah sees"):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:15">Ezra 10:15</A>, son of Tikvah, and a contemporary of Ezra. It is disputed whether he and Jonathan opposed or supported Ezra in the matter of prosecuting those who had married foreign wives = Ezekias, 1 Esdras 9:14, or Ezias.
<P> See JONATHAN, 9.
<P> Two translations of the Hebrew phrase (`amadh `al-zo'th) are given:
<P> (1) "stood over this matter," i.e. supported Ezra; so the King James Version ("were employed in this matter"), and so Septuagint, 1 Esdras 9:14, the Revised Version margin. This is supported by 9:4, "Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly," where the same phrase is found.
<P> (2) the Revised Version (British and American) "stood up against this matter," so BDB, Gesenius, Bertheau, Stade.
<P> Both translations can be supported by parallels in Hebrew. The context is better suited by the former rendering.
<P> David Francis Roberts
