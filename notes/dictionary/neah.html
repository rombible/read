            <P><B>NEAH</B><P> ne'-a (ha-ne`ah, "the neah"; Annoua):
<P> A town in the lot of Zebulun (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:13">Joshua 19:13</A>), mentioned along with Gath-hepher and Rimmon. It is possibly identical with "Neiel" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:27">Joshua 19:27</A>). No name resembling either of these has yet been recovered, although the district in which the place must be sought is pretty definitely indicated. It may probably have lain to the North of Rimmon (Rummaneh), about 4 miles Northeast of Seffuriyeh.
