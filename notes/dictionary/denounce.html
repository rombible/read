<P> Occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+30:18">Deuteronomy 30:18</A>: "I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish." It is used here in the obsolete sense of "to declare," to make known in a solemn manner. It is not found in the Bible with the regular meaning of "to censure," "arraign," etc.
