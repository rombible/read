            <P><B>PILGRIM; PILGRIMAGE</B><P> pil'-grim, pil'-grimaj:
<P> "Pilgrim" in English Versions of the Bible for parepidemos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:11">1&nbsp;Peter 2:11</A>). "Pilgrimage" for maghor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+47:9">Genesis 47:9</A> (the Revised Version margin "sojournings"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+119:54">Psalms 119:54</A>; and (the King James Version) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+6:4">Exodus 6:4</A> (the Revised Version (British and American) "sojournings")). Both the Hebrew (see GER) and Greek words contain the idea of foreign residence, but it is the residence and not travel that is implied. Consequently "pilgrim" is a poor translation, and "sojourner," "sojourning" should have been used throughout. In the New Testament passages heaven is thought of as the contrasted permanent dwelling-place, while the Old Testament usages seem to be without a contrast definitely in mind.
