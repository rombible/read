            <P><B>EXPEDIENT</B><P> eks-pe'-di-ent (sumphero):
<P> The Greek word translated "expedient" (sumphero) means literally, "to bear or bring together"; with a personal reference, "to be well or profitable." In the New Testament it never means "profitable" or "convenient" as opposed to what is strictly right. It is translated "expedient" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+11:50">John 11:50</A>, "it is expedient for us," the Revised Version (British and American) "for you"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+16:7">John 16:7</A>, "It is expedient for you that I go away," i.e. "profitable," "for your good," 18:14;
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+6:12">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+10:23">10:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+8:10">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+12:1">12:1</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+19:10">Matthew 19:10</A>, instead of "not good to marry," the Revised Version (British and American) has "not expedient." The modern sense of "expediency" as "hastening" or "acceleration," is not found in the New Testament, any more than its bad sense of "mere convenience." "Nothing but the right can ever be expedient" (Whately).
