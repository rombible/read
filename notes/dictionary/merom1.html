It is a place memorable in the history of the conquest of Palestine. Here Joshua completely routed the confederacy of the northern chiefs under Jabin. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/11-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/11-5.html">Joshua 11:5</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/11-7.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/11-7.html">Joshua 11:7</a> ) It is a remarkable fact that though by common consent "the waters of Merom" are identified with the lake thorough which the Jordan runs between Banias and the Sea of Galilee --the <I>Bahr el-Huleh</I> of the modern Arabs-- Yet that identity cannot be proved by any ancient record. In form the lake is not far from a triangle, base being at the north and the apex at the south. It measures about three miles in each direction, and eleven feet deep. The water is clear and sweet; it is covered in parts by a broad-leaved plant, and abounds in water-fowl. (The northern part is a dense swamp of papyrus reeds, as large as the lake itself. See "Rob Roy on the Jordan." --ED.) </FONT></body></html>
