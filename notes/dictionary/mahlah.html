            <P><B>MAHLAH</B><P> ma'-la (machlah "sickness" or "song," etymology doubtful):
<P> (1) Eldest of Zelophehad's 5 daughters (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+26:33">Numbers 26:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+27:1">27:1</A>). As Zelophehad, grandson of Manasseh, had no sons, the daughters successfully claimed their father's inheritance. The law was altered in their favor on condition that they married into their father's tribe. They agreed and married their cousins (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+36:11">Numbers 36:11</A>). The whole chapter should be read and compared with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+17:3">Joshua 17:3</A>, because the decision became a precedent.
<P> (2) Another (the King James Version "Mahalah"), same Hebrew name as above, daughter of Hammoleketh, grand-daughter of Manasseh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:18">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:18</A>).
<P> Henry Wallace
