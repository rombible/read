( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/3-24.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/3-24.html">Genesis 3:24</a> ) Figures of Cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark.

Their wings were to be stretched upwards, and their faces "towards each other and towards the mercy-seat." It is remarkable that with such precise directions as to their position, attitude and material, nothing, save that they were winged, is said concerning their shape. On the whole it seems likely that the word "cherub" meant not only the composite creature-form, of which the man, lion, ox and eagle were the elements, but, further, some peculiar and mystical form. (Some suppose that the cherubim represented <I>Gods providence</I> among men, the four faces expressing the characters of that providence: its wisdom and intelligence (man), its strength (ox), its kingly authority (lion), its swiftness, far-sighted (eagle). Others, combining all the other references with the description of the living creatures in Revelation, make the cherubim to represent <I>Gods redeemed people.</I> The qualities of the four faces are those which belong to Gods people. Their facing four ways, towards all quarters of the globe, represents their duty of extending the truth. The wings show swiftness of obedience; and only the redeemed can sing the song put in their mouths in ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Revelation+5:8-14" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+5:8-14&amp;t=niv">Revelation 5:8-14</a> ) --ED). </FONT></body></html>
