<P> LITERATURE
<P> Several words are rendered by "cistern," "well," "pool," the relations of which in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) are as follows:
<P> Use of Terms:
<P> "Cistern," bo'r (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</A>, etc.), or bor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:31">2&nbsp;Kings 18:31</A>). The latter word is frequently in the King James Version translated "well." the Revised Version (British and American) in these cases changes to "cistern" in text (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+6:11">Deuteronomy 6:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+26:10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+9:25">Nehemiah 9:25</A>) margin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+14:3">Jeremiah 14:3</A>), rendered "pit" in the King James Version are changed to "cistern" the Revised Version (British and American) (the latter in the American Standard Revised Version only).
<P> The proper Hebrew word for "well" is be'er (seen in Beer-sheba, "well of the oath," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+21:31">Genesis 21:31</A>), but other terms are thus rendered in the King James Version, as `ayin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+24:13,16">Genesis 24:13,16</A>, etc., and frequently), ma`yan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:15">Joshua 18:15</A>), maqor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+10:11">Proverbs 10:11</A>). ally changes to "fountain"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+15:27">Exodus 15:27</A>, however, it renders `ayin by "springs," and in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+84:6">Psalms 84:6</A>, ma`yan by, "place of springs." "Pool," 'agham (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+14:23">Isaiah 14:23</A>, etc.; in the King James Version, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+7:19">Exodus 7:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+8:5">8:5</A>, rendered "ponds"); more frequently berekhah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+2:13">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+4:12">4:12</A>, etc.). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+84:6">Psalms 84:6</A> the cognate berakhah, is changed to "blessing."
<P> In the New Testament "well" represents the two words:
<P> pege (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+4:6,14">John 4:6,14</A>; in the Revised Version, margin "spring"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:17">2&nbsp;Peter 2:17</A>; the Revised Version (British and American) renders "springs"), and phrear (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+4:11,12">John 4:11,12</A>). "Pool" is kolumbethra, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+5:2,4,7">John 5:2,4,7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+9:7,11">9:7,11</A>.
<P> 1. General:
<P> The efforts made to supplement the natural water supply, both in agricultural and in populated areas, before as well as after the Conquest, are clearly seen in the innumerable cisterns, wells and pools which abound throughout Palestine The rainy season, upon which the various storage systems depend, commences at the end of October and ends in the beginning of May. In Jerusalem, the mean rainfall in 41 years up to 1901 was 25,81 inches, falling in a mean number of 56 days (see Glaisher, Meteorological Observations, 24). Toward the end of summer, springs and wells, where they have not actually dried up, diminish very considerably, and cisterns and open reservoirs become at times the only sources of supply. Cisterns are fed from surface and roof drainage. Except in the rare instances where springs occur, wells depend upon percolation. The' great open reservoirs or pools are fed from surface drainage and, in some cases, by aqueducts from springs or from more distant collecting pools. In the case of private cisterns, it is the custom of the country today to close up the inlets during the early days of the rain, so as to permit of a general wash down of gathering surfaces, before admitting the water. Cisterns, belonging to the common natives, are rarely cleansed, and the inevitable scum which collects is dispersed by plunging the pitcher several times before drawing water. When the water is considered to be bad, a somewhat primitive cure is applied by dropping earth into the cistern, so as to sink all impurities with it, to the bottom. The accumulation often found in ancient cisterns probably owes some of its presence to this same habit.
<P> 2. Wells or Cylindrical Cisterns:
<P> It is necessary to include wells under the head of cisterns, as there appears to be some confusion in the use of the two terms. Wells, so called, were more often deep cylindrical reservoirs, the lower part of which was sunk in the rock and cemented, the upper part being built with open joints, to receive the surface percolation. They were often of great depth. Job's well at Jerusalem, which is certainly of great antiquity, is 125 ft. deep (see Palestine Exploration Fund, "Jerus," 371).
<P> The discovery of "living water" when digging a well, recorded in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+26:19">Genesis 26:19</A> margin, appears to have been an unusual incident. Uzziah hewed out many cisterns in the valley for his cattle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+26:9,10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:9,10</A> the Revised Version (British and American)), and he built towers, presumably to keep watch over both cattle and cisterns. Isaac "digged again the wells" which had been filled in by the Philistines (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+26:18">Genesis 26:18</A>). Wells were frequently dug in the plain, far from villages, for flocks and herds, and rude stone troughs were provided nearby. The well was usually covered with a stone, through which a hole was pierced sufficiently large to allow of free access for the pitchers. A stone was placed over this hole (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+29:10">Genesis 29:10</A>) when the well was not in use. The great amount of pottery found in ancient cisterns suggests that clay pots were used for drawing water (see Bible Sidelights, 88). Josephus (Ant., IV, viii, 37) elucidates the passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:33">Exodus 21:33</A> requiring the mouth of a "pit" or "well" to be covered with planks against accidents. This would seem to apply to wide-mouthed wells which had not been narrowed over to receive a stone cover. It may have been a well or cistern similar to these into which Joseph was cast (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+37:24">Genesis 37:24</A>). In fact, dry-wells and cisterns formed such effective dungeons, that it is very probable they were often used for purposes of detention. From earliest times, wells have been the cause of much strife. The covenant between Abimelech and Abraham at Beersheba (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+32">Genesis 32</A>) was a necessity, no less pressing then than it is now. The well, today, is a center of life in the East. Women gather around it in pursuit of their daily duties, and travelers, man and beast, divert their course thereto, if needs be, for refreshment; and news of the outer world is carried to and from the well. It is, in fact, an all-important center, and daily presents a series of characteristic Bible scenes. The scene between Rebekah and the servant of Abraham (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+24:11">Genesis 24:11</A>) is one with frequent parallels. The well lies usually at some little distance from the village or city. Abraham's servant made his "camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of the evening, the time that women go out to draw water." Saul and his servant found young maidens going out of the city to draw water (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+9:11">1&nbsp;Samuel 9:11</A>). Moses helped the daughters of the priest of Midian at the well, which was evidently at some distance from habitation (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:16">Exodus 2:16</A>).
<P> 3. Private Cisterns:
<P> Private cisterns must be distinguished from public cisterns or wells. They were smaller and were sunk in the rocks within private boundaries, each owner having his own cistern (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:31">2&nbsp;Kings 18:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+5:15">Proverbs 5:15</A>). Ancient sites are honeycombed with these cisterns. A common type in Jerusalem seems to have been bottle-shaped in section, the extended bottom part being in the softer rock, and the narrow neck in the hard upper stratum. Many irregularly shaped cisterns occur with rock vaults supported by rock or masonry piers. Macalister tells of the discovery at Gezer of a small silt catchpit attached to a private cistern, and provided with an overflow channel leading to the cistern. It is an early instance of a now well-known method of purification. The universal use of cement rendering to the walls of the cisterns was most necessary to seal up the fissures of the rock. The "broken cisterns" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</A>) probably refer to insufficiently sealed cisterns.
<P> 4. Public Cisterns:
<P> Besides private cisterns there were huge public rock-cut cisterns within the city walls. The great water caverns under the Temple area at Jerusalem show a most extensive system of water storage (see Recovery of Jerusalem, chapter vii). There are 37 of these described in Palestine Exploration Fund, "Jerus," 217, and the greatest is an immense rock-cut cavern the roof of which is partly rock and partly stone, supported by rock piers (see Fig. 1, Palestine Exploration Fund). It is 43 ft. deep with a storage capacity of over two million gallons and there are numerous access manholes. This cistern is fed by an aqueduct from Solomon's Pools about 10 miles distant by road, and is locally known as Bahar el Kebir, the "Great Sea." One of the most recent and one of the most interesting rock-cut reservoirs yet discovered is that at Gezer. (See Palestine Exploration Fund Statement, 1908, 96.) In this example, the pool of spring water is reached by a great rock-tunnel staircase which descends 94 ft. 6 inches from the surface. The staircase diminishes in size as it descends, and at its greatest, it is 23 ft. high and 12 ft. 10 inches wide. These proportions may seem unnecessarily large, but may be accounted for by the necessity for providing light at the water level. As a matter of fact, the brink of the pool receives the light from above. The work dates back to pre-Israelite times.
<P> 5. Pools and Aqueducts:
<P> Open pools were common in every city. They were cut out of the rock and were built and cemented at points where occasion demanded. They were often of great size. The pool outside Jerusalem known as Birket es Sultan measures 555 ft. x 220 ft. x 36 ft. deep, and the so-called Hezekiah's Pool within the walls, is 240 ft. x 144 ft. x about 20 ft. deep. The latter probably owes its origin to the rock-cut fosse of early Jewish date. The Birket es Sultan, on the other hand, probably dates from the time of the Turkish occupation. They may, however, be taken as examples, which, if somewhat larger, are still in accord with the pool system of earlier history. Pools were usually fed by surface drainage, and in some cases by aqueducts from springs at some distance away. They seem to have been at the public service, freely accessible to both man and beast. Pools situated outside the city walls were sometimes connected by aqueducts with pools within the city, so that the water could be drawn within the walls in time of siege. The so-called Pools of Solomon, three in number (see Fig. 3), situated about 10 miles by road from Jerusalem, are of large proportions and are fed by surface water and by aqueducts from springs. The water from these pools is conveyed in a wonderfully engineered course, known as the lower-level aqueduct, which searches the winding contours of the Judean hills for a distance of about 15 miles, before reaching its destination in "the great sea" under the Temple area. This aqueduct is still in use, but its date is uncertain (see G. A. Smith, Jerusalem, 131, where the author finds reason for ascribing it to the period of Herod). The course and destination of another aqueduct known as the high-level aqueduct is less definite. These aqueducts are of varying dimensions. The low-level aqueduct at a point just before it enters the Temple area was found to measure 3 ft. high x 2 ft. 3 inches wide, partly rock-cut and partly built, and rendered in smooth-troweled cement, with well-squared stone covers (see Palestine Exploration Fund, Excavations at Jerusalem, 53). There are many remains of rock-cut aqueducts throughout Palestine (see Fig. 4) which seem to indicate their use in early Hebrew times, but the lack of Old Testament references to these works is difficult to account for, unless it is argued that in some cases they date back to pre-Israelite times. The great tunnel and pool at Gezer lends a measure of support to this hypothesis. On the other hand, a plea for a Hebrew origin is also in a measure strengthened by the very slight reference in the Old Testament to such a great engineering feat as the cutting of the Siloam tunnel, which is doubtless the work of Hezekiah. The pool of Siloam was originally a simple rock-cut reservoir within the walls, and was constructed by Hezekiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+32:30">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:30</A>). It measures 75 ft. x 71 ft. It is the upper pool of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:3">Isaiah 7:3</A>. A lower overflow pool existed immediately beyond, contained by the city wall across the Tyropoeon valley. The aqueduct which supplies the upper pool takes a tortuous course of about 1,700 ft. through the solid rock from the Virgin's fountain, an intermittent spring on the East slope of the hill. The water reaches the pool on the Southwest of the spur of Ophel, and it was in the rock walls of this aqueduct that the famous Siloam inscription recording the completion of the work was discovered.
<P> Herod embellished the upper pool, lining it with stone and building arches around its four sides (see Palestine Exploration Fund, Excavations at Jerusalem, 154), and the pool was most likely in this condition in the time of Christ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+9:6,7">John 9:6,7</A>). There are numerous other pools, cisterns and aqueducts in and around Jerusalem, which provide abundant evidence of the continual struggle after water, made by its occupants of all times (see G. A. Smith, Jerusalem, chapter v, volume I).

<P> 6. Figurative Uses:
<P> Good wives are described as cisterns (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+5:15">Proverbs 5:15</A>). "The left ventricle of the heart, which retains the blood till it be redispersed through the body, is called a cistern" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+12:6">Ecclesiastes 12:6</A>). Idols, armies and material objects in which Israel trusted were "broken cisterns" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</A>, see above) "soon emptied of all the aid and comfort which they possess, and cannot fill themselves again."
