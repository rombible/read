            <P><B>CAST</B><P> In general "to throw," with various degrees of violence; usually, with force, but not so necessarily, as e.g. in "cast a net," "cast lots." When applied to molten metal, as in English, first, "to let run. into molds," with reference to their descent by gravity, and, then, "to form," as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+25:12">Exodus 25:12</A>, etc. Usually in the New Testament for ballo, but not always. Thus, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:29">Luke 1:29</A> "cast in her mind" means "considered" (dielogizeto); "cast reproach" for Greek oneidizon, "reproached" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:44">Matthew 27:44</A>); "casting down" for kathaireo, "demolishing" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+10:4">2&nbsp;Corinthians 10:4</A>); "casting all anxiety upon" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+5:7">1&nbsp;Peter 5:7</A>), a still stronger term, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+17:2">Luke 17:2</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:19">Acts 27:19</A>. As a fundamental Greek word, it is compounded with many prepositions, "about," "away," "down," "forth," "in," "into," "off," "out," "up," "upon." "Cast down" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+4:9">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:9</A> the King James Version is used in a military sense of one prostrated, but not killed in battle. Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+42:5">Psalms 42:5</A> with the Revised Version, margin. "Castaway" of the King James Version in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+9:27">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:27</A>, is in the Revised Version (British and American) "rejected" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+6:8">Hebrews 6:8</A>), adokimos, i.e. what the application of a test shows to be counterfeit, or unfit; translated "reprobate" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+13:5,6,7">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:5,6,7</A>, etc.
