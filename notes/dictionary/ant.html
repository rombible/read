            <P><B>ANT</B><P> (nemalah = Arabic namalah):
<P> The word occurs only twice in the Bible, in the familiar passages in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+6:6">Proverbs 6:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:25">30:25</A> in both of which this insect is made an example of the wisdom of providing in the summer for the wants of the winter. Not all ants store up seeds for winter use, but among the ants of Palestine there are several species that do so, and their well-marked paths are often seen about Palestinian threshing-floors and in other places where seeds are to be obtained. The path sometimes extends for a great distance from the nest.
<P> Alfred Ely Day
