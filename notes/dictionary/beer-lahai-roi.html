<P> "A fountain of water in the wilderness," "the fountain in the way to Shur" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+16:7-14">Genesis 16:7-14</A>). It was the scene of Hagar's theophany, and here Isaac dwelt for some time (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+16:7">Genesis 16:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+24:62">24:62</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:11">25:11</A>). The site is in The Negeb between Kadesh and Bered (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+16:14">Genesis 16:14</A>). Rowland identifies the well with the modern `Ain Moilaihhi, circa 50 miles South of Beersheba and 12 miles West of `Ain Kadis. Cheyne thinks that Hagar's native country, to which she was fleeing and from which she took a wife for Ishmael, was not Egypt (mitsrayim), but a north Arabian district called by the Assyrians Mucri (Encyclopedia Biblica).
