<P> This proper name in the Revised Version (British and American) takes the place of the translation "that sat in the seat" in the King James Version (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:8">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:8</A>). The phrase so rendered is meaningless. The text has evidently suffered corruption. There can be no doubt that a proper name is intended. This, according to the parallel passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:11</A>, should be Jashobeam. Some scholars think that this also is a corruption, and by a process of emendation arrive at "Eshbaal" as the correct name (Driver, Hebrew Text of S; SBOT, at the place).
