            <P><B>ENDOW; ENDUE</B><P> en-dou', en-du':
<P> "Endow" meant originally "to provide with a dowry"; "indue" took the meaning "clothe"; the likeness between the literal meanings has confused the metaphorical use of the words in spite of their difference in origin. Thus we find in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+30:20">Genesis 30:20</A>, the King James Version "endued me with a good dowry" the Revised Version (British and American) "endowed" (zabhadh, "bestow upon," "endow"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:16">Exodus 22:16</A>, the King James Version "endow her to be his wife" the Revised Version (British and American) "pay a dowry for her" mahar, "purchase" "endow"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+22:29">Deuteronomy 22:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+2:12,13">2&nbsp;Chronicles 2:12,13</A>, the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) "endued" with understanding (from yadha`, "know"); and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</A>, the King James Version "endued with power," the Revised Version (British and American) "clothed" (enduo, "clothe").
