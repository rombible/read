            <P><B>ABOLISH</B><P> a-bol'-ish (chathath, "to be broken down," "made void," "My righteousness shall not be abolished" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+51:6">Isaiah 51:6</A>), i.e. as shown in God's faithfulness to His promises; machah, "to erase," "blot out," "that your works may be abolished" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+6:6">Ezekiel 6:6</A>) katargeo, "to render inoperative," "bring to nought," "make of no effect," "when he shall have abolished all rule" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:24">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:24</A>), every power opposed to God's kingdom; "having abolished in his flesh the enmity" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</A>)):
<P> By His death, Christ did away with the race separation due to historic ordinances and ceremonial laws (as of circumcision and uncircumcision); through the cross He wrought the reconciliation, and secured that common access to the Father by which the union is maintained.
<P> "Our Saviour Christ Jesus .... abolished death" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:10">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:10</A>). Men still die, "it is appointed unto men" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9:27">Hebrews 9:27</A>), but the fear of death as having power to terminate or affect our personal existence and our union with God, as a dreadful stepping out into the unknown and unknowable (into Sheol of the impenetrable gloom), and as introducing us to a final and irreversible judgment, has been removed. Christ has taken out of it its sting (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:55">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:55</A> f) and all its hurtful power (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</A>); has shown it to be under His control (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</A>), brought to light the incorruptible life beyond, and declared the ultimate destruction of death (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:26">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:26</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</A>). The Greek (katargeitai) indicates that the process of destruction was then going on.
