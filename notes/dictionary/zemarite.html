            <P><B>ZEMARITE</B><P> zem'-a-rit (ha-tsemari; ho Samaraios):
<P> A Canaanite people named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:18">Genesis 10:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:16">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:16</A>. The occurrence of the name between Arvadite and Hamathite gives a hint as to locality. A place called Cumur is mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Letters along with Arvad. The name probably survives in that of Sumra, a village on the seacoast between Tripolis and Ruwad, about 1 1/2 miles North of Nahr el-Kebir. We may with some certainty identify this modern village with the site of the town from which the inhabitants were named "Zemarites."
