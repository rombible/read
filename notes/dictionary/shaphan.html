            <P><B>SHAPHAN</B><P> sha'-fan (shaphan, "rockbadger," English Versions of the Bible "coney"; Saphphan):
<P> An old totem clan name (so W.R. Smith; compare, however, the article TOTEMISM; Gray, Gray, Studies in Hebrew Proper Names, 103, and Jacob's Studies in Biblical Archaeology, 84).
<P> (1) Son of Azaliah and scribe of King Josiah. He received from Hilkiah the Book of the Law which had been found in the Temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+22:3">2&nbsp;Kings 22:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:8-28">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:8-28</A>). It was from Shaphan's lips that Josiah heard the Law read. Shaphan was also one of those sent by the king to the prophetess Huldah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+22">2&nbsp;Kings 22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34</A>). He was undoubtedly one of the staunchest supporters of Josiah in his work of reform. He was the father of Ahikam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+22:12">2&nbsp;Kings 22:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:20">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+26:24">Jeremiah 26:24</A>), who befriended and protected the prophet Jeremiah. Another son, Elasah, was one of the two men entrusted by Jeremiah with his letter to the captives in Babylon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+29:3">Jeremiah 29:3</A>). A third son, Gemariah, vainly tried to prevent King Jehoiakim from burning "the roll" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+36:10,11,12,25">Jeremiah 36:10,11,12,25</A>). The Micaiah of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+36:11,12">Jeremiah 36:11,12</A>, and Gedaliah, the governor of Judea after the captivity of 586 BC, were his grandsons (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+39:14">Jeremiah 39:14</A>).
<P> (2) Perhaps the father of Jaazaniah, one of the 70 men whom Ezekiel saw, in his vision of the Temple, sacrificing to idols (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+8:11">Ezekiel 8:11</A>).
