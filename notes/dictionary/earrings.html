They were worn by women and by youth of both sexes. These ornaments appear to have been regarded with superstitious reverence as an amulet. On this account they were surrendered along with the idols by Jacobs household. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/35-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/35-4.html">Genesis 35:4</a> ) Chardin describes earrings with talismanic figures and characters on them as still existing in the East. Jewels were sometimes attached to the rings. The size of the earrings still worn in eastern countries far exceeds what is usual among ourselves; hence they formed a handsome present, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/job/42-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/job/42-11.html">Job 42:11</a> ) or offering to the service of God.
