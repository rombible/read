            <P><B>COVENANT OF SALT</B><P> solt (berith melach; halas, classical Greek hals):
<P> As salt was regarded as a necessary ingredient of the daily food, and so of all sacrifices offered to Yahweh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+2:13">Leviticus 2:13</A>), it became an easy step to the very close connection between salt and covenant-making. When men ate together they became friends. Compare the Arabic expression, "There is salt between us"; "He has eaten of my salt," which means partaking of hospitality which cemented friendship; compare "eat the salt of the palace" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:14">Ezra 4:14</A>). Covenants were generally confirmed by sacrificial meals and salt was always present. Since, too, salt is a preservative, it would easily become symbolic of an enduring covenant. So offerings to Yahweh were to be by a statute forever, "a covenant of salt for ever before Yahweh" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+18:19">Numbers 18:19</A>). David received his kingdom forever from Yahweh by a "covenant of salt" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+13:5">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13:5</A>). In the light of these conceptions the remark of our Lord becomes the more significant: "Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</A>).
