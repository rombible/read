Its wanton destruction by that conqueror is well known. Its site is now called the <I>Chehl-Minar</I> , or Forty Pillars. Here, on a platform hewn out of the solid rock the sides of which face the four cardinal points, are the remains of two great palaces, built respectively by Darius Hytaspes and his son Xerxes, besides a number of other edifices, chiefly temples. They are of great extent and magnificence, covering an area of many acres. </FONT></body></html>
