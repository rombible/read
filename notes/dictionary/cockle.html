            <P><B>COCKLE</B><P> kok'-'-l (King James Version margin "stinking weeds," the Revised Version, margin "noisome weeds"; bo'shah, from Hebrew root ba'ash, "to stink"; batos):
<P> "Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+31:40">Job 31:40</A>). On account of the meaning of the Hebrew root we should expect that the reference was rather to repulsive, offensive weeds than to the pretty corn cockle. It is very possible that no particular plant is here intended, though the common Palestinian "stinking" arums have been suggested by Hooker.
