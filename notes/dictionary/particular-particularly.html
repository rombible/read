<P> The adverbial phrase "in particular" occurs twice in the King James Version (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+12:27">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:27</A>, ek merous, the Revised Version (British and American) "severally," the Revised Version margin "each in his part"; and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:33">Ephesians 5:33</A>, hoi kath' hena, the Revised Version (British and American) "severally"); in both cases it has the obsolete meaning of "severally," "individually." The adverb "particularly" occurs in the same sense in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:19">Acts 21:19</A> the King James Version, kath' hen hekaston, the Revised Version (British and American) "one by one," and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9:5">Hebrews 9:5</A> the King James Version, kata meros, the Revised Version (British and American) "severally." We have the plural noun in the sense of "details" in 2 Macc 2:30: "to be curious in particulars"; 11:20, (the King James Version "Of the particulars I have given order," the Revised Version (British and American) I have given order in detail); and the adjective "particular" in the sense of "special" in the first Prologue to Sirach (King James Version, Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) peculiares; the whole section was omitted in the Revised Version (British and American)).
