            <P><B>DEADLY</B><P> ded'-li:
<P> In the Old Testament two words are used in the sense of a "mortal (Hebrew nephesh, "hateful," "foul") enemy" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+17:9">Psalms 17:9</A>), and in the sense of "fatal disease," the destructiveness of which causes a general panic (Hebrew maweth, "death," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+5:11">1&nbsp;Samuel 5:11</A>).
<P> In the New Testament we have in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+13:3,12">Revelation 13:3,12</A> the expression "deadly wound" (Greek thanatos), better "death-stroke," as in the Revised Version (British and American), and the phrases "deadly thing," i.e. poison (thanasimon ti, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</A>), and "full of deadly poison" (meste iou thanatephorou, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:8">James 3:8</A>), said of an unruly tongue. Both Greek words convey the idea of "causing or bringing death" and occur in classical literature in a variety of uses in combination with the bite of venomous reptiles, deadly potions, mortal wounds and fatal contagion.
