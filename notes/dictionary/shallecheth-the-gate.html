            <P><B>SHALLECHETH, THE GATE</B><P> shal'-e-keth, sha-le'-keth (sha`ar shallekheth, i.e. as in margin, "Casting forth"):
<P> A gate of the temple "at the causeway that goeth up" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:16">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:16</A>)--probably an ascent from the Tyropoeon Valley to the West of the temple. It has been supposed on account of the meaning of the name that the ashes and offal of the temple were cast forth there, but this is very unlikely--they were thrown into the Kidron valley to the East or Southeast. The Septuagint has pastophorion, which seems to point to a building with chambers; in consonance with this Cheyne reads in the Hebrew lishkoth, "(of) the chambers."
