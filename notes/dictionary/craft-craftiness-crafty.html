            <P><B>CRAFT; CRAFTINESS; CRAFTY</B><P> kraft, kraf'-ti-nes, kraf'-ti, (panourgia), (panourgos):
<P> The original meaning is that of "ability to do anything," universally applied in a bad sense to unscrupulous wickedness, that stops short of no measure, however reprehensible, in order to attain its purposes; then, in a modified form, to resourcefulness in wrong, cunning (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+8:25">Daniel 8:25</A>; 2 Macc 12:24; the Revised Version, margin "jugglery"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+20:23">Luke 20:23</A>, Jesus perceives "the craftiness" of His adversaries, i.e. the complicated network which they have laid to ensnare Him. The art with which a plot is concealed, and its direction to the ruin of others, are elements that enter into the meaning. Heinrici on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+3:19">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:19</A> illustrates from Plato the distinction between craftiness and wisdom. There is a touch of humor in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+12:16">2&nbsp;Corinthians 12:16</A>, when Paul speaks of his conduct toward the Corinthians as having been "crafty."
