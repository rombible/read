            <P><B>MALEFACTOR</B><P> mal-e-fak'-ter (kakopoios, "a bad doer," i.e. "evildoer," "criminal"; kakourgos, "a wrongdoer"):
<P> The former occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+18:30">John 18:30</A> the King James Version, the latter, which is the stronger term, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:32,39">Luke 23:32,39</A>. The former describes the subject as doing or making evil, the latter as creating or originating the bad, and hence, designates the more energetic, aggressive, initiating type of criminality.
