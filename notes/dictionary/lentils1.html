The red pottage which Jacob prepared and for which Esau sold his birthright was made from them. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/25-34.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/25-34.html">Genesis 25:34</a> ) There are three of four kinds of lentils, all of which are much esteemed in those countries where they are grown, viz., the south of Europe, Asia and north Africa. The red lentil is still a favorite article of food in the East. Lentil bread is eaten by the poor of Egypt. The lentil is much used with other pulse in Roman Catholic countries during Lent; and some are of opinion that from this usage the season derives its name. </FONT></body></html>
