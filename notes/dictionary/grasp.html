            <P><B>GRASP</B><P> grasp:
<P> The word harpagmos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</A>), is rendered by the King James Version "robbery," by the Revised Version (British and American) "a prize," and by the American Standard Revised Version "a thing to be grasped." By derivation the term may denote either an act of seizing or the aim or result of the action. In the context Paul is discussing, not Christ's opinion of His equality with God, but His amazing self-sacrifice in laying aside His equally for our sakes. He but laid it aside for us. It is better to render with the Revised Version (British and American) "a prize."
