            <P><B>AHAB AND ZEDEKIAH</B><P> a'-hab, zed-e-ki'-a ('ach'abh, "uncle"; tsidhqiyahu, "Yahweh is my righteousness"):
<P> Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah, were two prophets against whom Jeremiah uttered an oracle for prophesying falsely in the name of Yahweh, and for immoral conduct. They should be delivered over to Nebuchadrezzar and be slain, and the captives of Judah that were in Babylon should take up the curse concerning them. "Yahweh make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the King of Babylon roasted in the fire" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+29:21">Jeremiah 29:21</A>).
<P> S. F. Hunter
