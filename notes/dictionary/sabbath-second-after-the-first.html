            <P><B>SABBATH, SECOND AFTER THE FIRST</B><P> (sabbaton deuteroproton (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:1">Luke 6:1</A>), literally, "the second-first sabbath," of the Revised Version margin):
<P> We will mention only a few of the explanations elicited by this expression.
<P> (1) It was the first Sabbath in the second year of a 7-year cycle comprising the period from one Sabbatic year to the other;
<P> (2) the first Sabbath after the second day of Passover, i.e. the first of the seven Sabbaths the Hebrews were to "count unto" themselves from "the morrow after the sabbath" (the day after Easter) until Pentecost (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+23:15">Leviticus 23:15</A>);
<P> (3) the first Sabbath in the Jewish ecclesiastical year (about the middle of March), the first Sabbath in the civil year (about the middle of September) being counted as the "first-first" Sabbath;
<P> (4) the term deuteroprotos, is a monstrous combination of the words deuteros, "second," and protos, "first," attributable to unskillful attempts at textual emendation on the part of copyists. This supposition would, of course, render unnecessary all other efforts to unravel the knotty problem, and, as a matter of fact, deuteroprotos is omitted by many manuscripts (including Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus). To those not feeling inclined to accept this solution we would suggest the first of the above-named explanations as the most natural and probable one.
