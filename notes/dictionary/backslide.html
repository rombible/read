            <P><B>BACKSLIDE</B><P> bak'-slid' (meshubhah; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+11:7">Hosea 11:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+14:4">14:4</A> and often in Ho and Jer, shobhabh; shobhebh, in Jer, 4 times:
<P> all meaning "turning back or away," "apostate," "rebellious." carar, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+4:16" target="_blank">Hosea 4:16</A> = "stubborn," "rebellious"; the Revised Version (British and American) "stubborn"): In all places the word is used of Israel forsaking Yahweh, and with a reference to the covenant relation between Yahweh and the nation, conceived as a marriage tie which Israel had violated. Yahweh was Israel's husband, and by her idolatries with other gods she had proved unfaithful (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+3:8,14">Jeremiah 3:8,14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+14:7">14:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+14:4">Hosea 14:4</A>). It may be questioned whether Israel was guilty so much of apostasy and defection, as of failure to grow with the growing revelation of God. The prophets saw that their contemporaries fell far short of their own ideal, but they did not realize how far their predecessors also had fallen short of the rising prophetic standard in ideal and action. See <a href="apostasy-apostate.html">APOSTASY</a>.
<P> Backslider bak'-slid-er cugh lebh:
<P> "The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+14:14">Proverbs 14:14</A>). But the Revised Version (British and American) "backslider" conveys the wrong impression of an apostate. The Hebrew expression here implies simply non-adherence to the right, "The bad man reaps the fruits of his act" (Toy, Prov, in loc.).
