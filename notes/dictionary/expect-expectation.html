            <P><B>EXPECT; EXPECTATION</B><P> eks-pekt', eks-pek-ta'-shun:
<P> Of the three Greek words, translated in the New Testament by "expect," prosdokao, meaning to look forward toward what will probably occur, whether in hope or dread (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:5">Acts 3:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</A>), is not as intense as ekdechomai (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+10:13">Hebrews 10:13</A>), meaning to wait for that of the realization of which one is assured ("as the husbandman waits for the processes of Nature (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+5:7">James 5:7</A>), and the patriarchs for the Divine promise," Westcott), or as vivid as the noun apokaradokia (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</A>, "earnest expectation"), which describes the stretching forth of the head toward an object that is anticipated (see Ellicott on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</A>). In the Old Testament "expectation" always means that which is expected, as
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+10:28">Proverbs 10:28</A>, "The expectation of the wicked shall perish."
