            <P><B>ELECT</B><P> e-lekt':
<P> That is, "chosen," "selected."
<P> In the Old Testament the word represents derivatives of bachar, elegit;
<P> In the New Testament eklektos. It means properly an object or objects of selection.
<P> This primary meaning sometimes passes into that of "eminent," "valuable," "choice"; often thus as a fact, in places where the King James Version uses "chosen" (or "elect") to translate the original (eg. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:6">1&nbsp;Peter 2:6</A>). In the King James Version "elect" (or "chosen") is used of Israel as the race selected for special favor and to be the special vehicle of Divine purposes (so 4 times in Apocrypha, Tobit and Ecclus); of the great Servant of Yahweh (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+23:35">Luke 23:35</A>; the "Christ of God, his chosen"); compare eminent saints as Jacob, Moses, Rufus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:13">Romans 16:13</A>); "the lady," and her "sister" of 2 Jn; of the holy angels (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:21">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:21</A>); with a possible suggestion of the lapse of other angels. Otherwise, and prevalently in the New Testament, it denotes a human community, also described as believers, saints, the Israel of God; regarded as in some sense selected by Him from among men, objects of His special favor, and correspondingly called to special holiness and service.
<P> See further under <a href="election.html" target="_blank">ELECTION</a>. In the English versions "elect" is not used as a verb:
<P> "to choose" is preferred; eg.
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+13:20">Mark 13:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</A>.
