            <P><B>ARCH</B><P> arch ('ayil; Septuagint ta ailam, in sense of "posts" or "colonnade"):
<P> Referred to repeatedly in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:16">Ezekiel 40:16</A>, but translation is an error for "porch" or "portico." the Revised Version (British and American) gives in marg, "or, colonnade. The meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain." The principle of arch construction was known to the Jews and examples of early Jewish rude arches have been found in Palestine. An arched form need not necessarily be constructed with radiating joints; it can be corbelled as at Mycenae (Treasury of Atreus). This type of construction has been found also in Palestine.
