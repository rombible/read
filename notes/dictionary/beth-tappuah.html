            <P><B>BETH-TAPPUAH</B><P> beth-tap'-u-a (beth-tappuach; Beththapphoue, "place of apples" (see however <a href="apple-apple-tree.html" target="_blank">APPLE</a>)); A town in the hill country of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:53">Joshua 15:53</A>), probably near Hebron (el Tappuah, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:43">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:43</A>), possibly the same as Tephon (1 Macc 9:50). The village of Tuffuch, 3 1/2 miles Northwest of Hebron, is the probable site; it stands on the edge of a high ridge, surrounded by very fruitful gardens; an ancient highroad runs through the village, and there are many old cisterns and caves.
