            <P><B>HEIFER</B><P> hef'-er (parah, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+19" target="_blank">Numbers 19</A> (see following article) and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+4:16">Hosea 4:16</A>; `eghlah, elsewhere in the Old Testament; damalis, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</A>):For the "heifer of three years old" in the King James Version, the Revised Version margin of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:5">Isaiah 15:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:34">Jeremiah 48:34</A>, see <a href="eglath-shelishiyah.html">EGLATH-SHELISHIYAH</a>. A young cow (contrast BULLOCK). The `eghlah figures specifically in religious rites only in the ceremony of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+21:1-9">Deuteronomy 21:1-9</A> for the cleansing of the land, where an unexpiated murder had been committed. This was not a sacrificial rite--the priests are witnesses only, and the animal was slain by breaking the neck--but sacrificial purity was required for the heifer. Indeed, it is commonly supposed that the rite as it now stands is a rededication of one that formerly had been sacrificial. In the sacrifices proper the heifer could be used for a peace offering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+3:1">Leviticus 3:1</A>), but was forbidden for the burnt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+1:3">Leviticus 1:3</A>) or sin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+4:3,14">Leviticus 4:3,14</A>) offerings. Hence, the sacrifice of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+16:2">1&nbsp;Samuel 16:2</A> was a peace offering. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+15:9">Genesis 15:9</A> the ceremony of the ratification of the covenant by God makes use of a heifer and a she-goat, but the reason for the use of the females is altogether obscure. Compare following article.
<P> Figuratively:
<P> The heifer appears as representing sleekness combined with helplessness in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+46:20">Jeremiah 46:20</A> (compare the comparison of the soldiers to `stalled calves' in the next verse). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+50:11">Jeremiah 50:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+10:11">Hosea 10:11</A>, the heifer is pictured as engaged in threshing. This was particularly light work, coupled with unusually abundant food (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+25:4">Deuteronomy 25:4</A>), so that the threshing heifer served especially well for a picture of contentment. ("Wanton" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+50:11">Jeremiah 50:11</A>, however, is an unfortunate translation in the Revised Version (British and American).) Hosea, in contrast, predicts that the "heifers" shall be set to the hard work of plowing and breaking the sods. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+14:18">Judges 14:18</A>, Samson uses "heifer" in his riddle to refer to his wife. This, however, was not meant to convey the impression of licentiousness that it gives the modern reader.
