            <P><B>TABOR</B><P> ta'-ber, tar'-bor (tabhor; Codex Vaticanus Thachcheia; Codex Alexandrinus Thabor):
<P> One of the towns in the territory of Zebulun, given to the Merarite Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:77">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:77</A>). The parallel list in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:24">Joshua 21:24</A> f contains no name like this. There is no indication of its position. Some have thought that it may correspond to Daberath in the territory of Issachar (21:28), now represented by Deburiyeh on the western slope of Mt. Tabor; others that it may be the mountain itself; and yet others that it may be a city on the mountain, which probably was occupied from very early times. There is a Tabor mentioned as on the border of Issachar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:22">Joshua 19:22</A>); but that is almost certainly the mountain. It has been suggested that Tabor in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:17</A> may be a contraction of Chisloth-tabor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:12">Joshua 19:12</A>), the modern Iksal, 3 miles West of the mountain. No certainty is possible.
