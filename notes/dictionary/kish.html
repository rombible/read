            <P><B>KISH</B><P> kish (qish; Kis, Keis, "bow," "power"):
<P> The name of five persons mentioned in the Bible:
<P> (1) The son of Abiel and the father of Saul, the first king of Israel. He was of the tribe of Benjamin, of the family of the Matrites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+9:1">1&nbsp;Samuel 9:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:51">14:51</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:21">Acts 13:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+10:21">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:21</A>). According to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:33">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:33</A> and 9:39, "Ner begat Kish" By reading "Ner begat Abner" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:51">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:51</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:28">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:28</A>), the difficulty is at least partly overcome. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:1">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:1</A>, Kish is also mentioned as the father of Saul, and again in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:14">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:14</A>, we are told that the sepulcher of Kish was located in the country of Benjamin, in Zela. His place of residence seems to have been at Gibeah.
<P> (2) Another Kish is mentioned (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:29">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:35">9:35</A>) as the son of Jeiel and his wife Maacah. He is usually supposed to be the uncle of Saul's father.
<P> (3) A Levite, the son of Mahli the Merarite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+23:21">1&nbsp;Chronicles 23:21</A>; compare 24:29).
<P> (4) Another Merarite Levite in the time of Hezekiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:12</A>).
<P> (5) The great-grandfather of Mordecai, of the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+2:5">Esther 2:5</A>).
