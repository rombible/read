            <P><B>HOME-BORN</B><P> hom'-born ('ezrach):
<P> A native-born Hebrew, as contrasted with a foreigner of different blood. The same Hebrew word is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+16:29">Leviticus 16:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+18:26">18:26</A> and elsewhere, but is translated differently. Home-born in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+2:14">Jeremiah 2:14</A> is a translation of the phrase yelidh bayith, where it means a person free-born as contrasted with a slave.
