            <P><B>TOWN</B><P> toun:
<P> This word is used to represent a number of different Hob terms in the Old Testament.
<P> (1) When any explanatory word or attendant circumstances show that a "city" was unwalled, and sometimes in the contrary case (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+23:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 23:7</A>), the Hebrew `ir is translated "town" by the King James Version, and the Revised Version (British and American) generally agrees with it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:5">Deuteronomy 3:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+27:5">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+9:19">Esther 9:19</A>).
<P> (2) Both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) translate chawwoth by "towns" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:41">Numbers 32:41</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:30">Joshua 13:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:13">1&nbsp;Kings 4:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:23">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:23</A>), while chatserim and perazoth both appear in the King James Version as "towns," but in the Revised Version (British and American) as "villages" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:16">Genesis 25:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+2:4">Zechariah 2:4</A>). See HAVVOTH-JAIR.
<P> (3) Bath, literally, "daughter," is sometimes found in the plural between the name of a city and chatserim, "villages," as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:45">Joshua 15:45</A> margin, "Ekron, with its daughters and its villages." "Towns" is evidently the appropriate translation, and, even without chatserim, bath is rendered "town" (the Revised Version (British and American) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:25">Numbers 21:25</A>, etc.). The same use of "daughter" occurs also in the Greek of 1 Macc 5:65 (thugater), the King James Version "town," the Revised Version (British and American) "village," margin "daughter."
<P> (4) the King James Version and the English Revised Version gloss qir, "wall" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+2:15">Joshua 2:15</A> by rendering it "town wall"; the American Standard Revised Version omits.
<P> (5) The Greek term komopoleis (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+1:38">Mark 1:38</A>), being a combination of the words for "village" and "city," is a clear attempt to describe something between the two, and is well translated "town."
<P> (6) the King James Version uses "town" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+10:11">Matthew 10:11</A> etc.) and "village" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+9:35">Matthew 9:35</A>, etc.) quite indifferently for kome; the Revised Version (British and American) has "village" throughout. For similar changes of the King James Version "town" compare 2 Macc 8:6 (chora); 11:5; 12:21 (chorion, the Revised Version (British and American) "place").
<P> See CITY; VILLAGE.
