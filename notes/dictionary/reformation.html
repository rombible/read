            <P><B>REFORMATION</B><P> ref-or-ma'-shun:
<P> The word is found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</A>, being the translation of diorthosis, in its only occurrence. This Greek word means etymologically "making straight," and was used of restoring to the normally straight condition that which is crooked or bent. In this passage it means the rectification of conditions, setting things to rights, and is a description of the Messianic time.
