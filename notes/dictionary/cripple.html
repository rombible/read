            <P><B>CRIPPLE</B><P> krip'-'-l (cholos):
<P> Only occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+14:8">Acts 14:8</A>, denoting the congenitally lame man at Lystra. In the King James Version (1611) the word is spelled "creeple." It originally meant one whose body is bent together as in the attitude of creeping. This was probably a case of infantile paralysis.
