He was the fifth recorded judge of Israel, and for many reasons the greatest of them all. When we first hear of him he was grown up and had sons, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/6-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/6-11.html">Judges 6:11</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/8-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/8-20.html">8:20</a> ) and from the apostrophe of the angel, ch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/6-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/6-12.html">Judges 6:12</a> ) we may conclude that he had already distinguished himself in war against the roving bands of nomadic robbers who had oppressed Israel for seven years. When the angel appeared, Gideon was threshing wheat with a flail in the wine-press, to conceal it from the predatory tyrants. His call to be a deliverer, and his destruction of Baals altar, are related in Judges 6. After this begins the second act of Gideons life. Clothed by the Spirit of God, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/6-34.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/6-34.html">Judges 6:34</a> ) comp. 1Chr 12:18; Luke 24:49 he blew a trumpet, and was joined by Zebulun, Naphtali and even the reluctant Asher. Strengthened by a double sign from God, he reduced his army of 32,000 by the usual proclamation. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/20-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/20-8.html"> 20:8</a> ) comp. 1 Macc. 3:56. By a second test at "the spring of trembling the further reduced the number of his followers to 300.

The midnight attack upon the Midianites, their panic, and the rout and slaughter that followed are told in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/7-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/7-1.html">Judges 7:1</a> ) ... The memory of this splendid deliverance took deep root in the national traditions.
