<P> A town in the lot of Issachar assigned to Manasseh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+17:11">Joshua 17:11</A>). Here dwelt the woman who had a familiar spirit, whom Saul consulted on the night before the battle of Gilboa (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+28:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 28:7</A>). Here also, according to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+83:10">Psalms 83:10</A>, perished fugitives of Sisera's army, after their defeat at the Kishon. The place was therefore not far from the Kishon and Tabor.
<P> It is generally identified with the modern Endur, a small village on the northern slope of Jebel ed-Duchy, with several ancient caves. It is not far from Nain and Shunem, and looks across the valley along which the broken ranks of Sisera may have attempted to make their way eastward to the open uplands, and thence to their native North. Coming hither from Gilboa, eluding the Philistine outposts under cover of the darkness, Saul would cross the Vale of Jezreel, and pass round the eastern base of the mountain, the Philistines being on the west.
<P> W. Ewing
