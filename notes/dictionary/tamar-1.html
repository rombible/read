            <P><B>TAMAR (1)</B><P> ta'-mar (tamar, "palm"; Codex Vaticanus Themar; Codex Alexandrinus Thamar (so Codex Vaticanus in Genesis)):
<P> (1) The wife of Er, the oldest son of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:6">Genesis 38:6</A>). Upon her husband's death under the displeasure of Yahweh, his brother Onan ought to have performed the husband's part, but he evaded his duty in this respect, and likewise perished. Shelah, the next brother, was promised to her, but not given. This led Tamar to the extraordinary course narrated in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:13">Genesis 38:13</A>, on which see JUDAH. By her father-in-law she became the mother of Perez and Zerah (the King James Version "Pharez and Zarah"). Judah, who at first condemned her to be burned (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:24">Genesis 38:24</A>), was compelled to vindicate her (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:25,26">Genesis 38:25,26</A>). Through Perez she became an ancestress of Jesus (Thamar, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+1:3">Matthew 1:3</A>).
<P> (2) A daughter of David and sister of Absalom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:1">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:1</A>). Her beauty inflamed her half-brother Amnon with passion, and by stratagem he forcibly violated her. This brought upon Amnon the terrible revenge of Absalom.
<P> See ABSALOM; AMNON.
<P> (3) A daughter of Absalom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+14:27">2&nbsp;Samuel 14:27</A>).
<P> See MAACAH.
