            <P><B>NOISOME</B><P> noi'-sum (hawwah, ra`; kakos):
<P> "Noisome" from "annoy" (annoysome) has in Bible English the meaning of "evil," "hurtful," not of "offensive" or "loathsome." It is the translation of hawwah, "mischief," "calamity" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+91:3">Psalms 91:3</A>, "noisome pestilence," the Revised Version (British and American) "deadly"); of ra`, a common word for "evil" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+14:15,21">Ezekiel 14:15,21</A>), "noisome beasts" (the Revised Version (British and American) "evil"). It occurs also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+31:40">Job 31:40</A> the King James Version margin as the translation of bo'shah, "noisome weeds," the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) "cockle," as in the King James Version margin; of kakos, "evil," "bad" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</A>), "a noisome and grievous sore." "Noisome" also occurs in Apocrypha (2 Macc 9:9) as the translation of baruno, "to make heavy," "oppress," where it seems to have the meaning of "loathsome."
