            <P><B>OFFICER</B><P> of'-i-ser:
<P> In the King James Version the term is employed to render different words denoting various officials, domestic, civil and military, such as caric, "eunuch," "minister of state" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+37:36">Genesis 37:36</A>); paqidh, "person in charge," "overseer" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+41:34">Genesis 41:34</A>); necibh, "stationed," "garrison," "prefect" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:19">1&nbsp;Kings 4:19</A>); shoTer, "scribe" or "secretary" (perhaps arranger or organizer), then any official or overseer. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+9:3">Esther 9:3</A> for the King James Version "officers of the king" the Revised Version (British and American) has (more literal) "they that did the king's business."
<P> In the New Testament, "officer" generally corresponds to the Greek word huperetes, "servant," or any person in the employ of another. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+5:25">Matthew 5:25</A> the term evidently means "bailiff" or exactor of the fine imposed by the magistrate, and corresponds to praktor, used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:58">Luke 12:58</A>.
