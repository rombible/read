            <P><B>PARVAIM</B><P> par-va'-im (parwayim; Septuagint Pharouaim):
<P> The word occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+3:6">2&nbsp;Chronicles 3:6</A>, as the place from which Solomon obtained gold for the decoration of his Temple. A derivation is given from the Sanskrit purva, "eastern," so that the name might be a vague term for the East (Gesenius, Thesaurus, 1125). Whether there was such a place in arabia is doubtful. Farwa in Yemen has been suggested, and also Saq el Farwain in Yemamah. Some have considered the name a shortened form of Cepharvayim which occurs in the Syriac and Targum Jonathan for the "Sephar" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:30">Genesis 10:30</A>.
