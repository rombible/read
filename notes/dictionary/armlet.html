            <P><B>ARMLET</B><P> arm'-let:
<P> The word translated "bracelet" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+1:10" target="_blank">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:10</A> the King James Version, probably denotes an "armlet," or "arm-band," worn on the upper arm. But it is the same word which with a different context is rendered "ankle- chains" (in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:50">Numbers 31:50</A> the Revised Version (British and American)). The "bracelet" of Sirach 21:21 the King James Version, worn upon the right arm, was an "armlet," as is seen from the list given of Judith's ornaments: who "decked herself bravely with her armlets (the Revised Version (British and American) `chains') and her bracelets, and her rings, and her ear-rings, and all her ornaments" (Judith 10:4). The nature of the ornaments given in the Revised Version (British and American) as "armlets," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+35:22">Exodus 35:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:50">Numbers 31:50</A>, and in the King James Version as "tablets," is uncertain. For full and distinguishing, descriptions of "arm-lets," "anklets," "bracelets," etc., found in ancient graves, see PEFS, 1905, 318. See also <a href="ornament.html">ORNAMENT</a>.
