            <P><B>CHLOE</B><P> klo'-e (Chloe, "a tender shoot"):
<P> A woman, presumably a Christian, mentioned only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+1:11">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:11</A>. She was a resident either of Corinth or of Ephesus. Paul had been informed by some of her household, probably Christian slaves, of the dissensions in the church at Corinth. Nothing more is known of her.
