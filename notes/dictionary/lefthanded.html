            <P><B>LEFTHANDED</B><P> left'-hand-ed ('iTTer yadh-yamin; Septuagint amphoterodexios, i.e. "ambidextrous"):
<P> The Hebrew presents a combination of words signifying literally, a man whose right hand is impeded or lame, who therefore uses the left hand instead, or one who by habit prefers the use of the left hand, where others use the right. It is interesting to note that in both instances, where the expression occurs in the Scripture, it refers to individuals belonging to the tribe of Benjamin (which name itself signifies "a son of the right hand"!). The first is Ehud, son of Gera, who killed Eglon, king of Moab, and thereby delivered Israel from paying tribute to the Moabites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:15">Judges 3:15</A>). The other instance is that of the 700 selected Benjamites, who, though lefthanded, "could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:16">Judges 20:16</A>; of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:2">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:2</A>).
