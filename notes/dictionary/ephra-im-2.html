( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Genesis+41:50-52" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+41:50-52&amp;t=niv">Genesis 41:50-52</a> ) The boundaries of the portion of Ephraim are given in ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Joshua+16:1-10" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Joshua+16:1-10&amp;t=niv">Joshua 16:1-10</a> ) The south boundary was coincident for part of its length with the north boundary of Benjamin. It extended from the Jordan on the east, at the reach opposite Jericho, to the Mediterranean on the west, probably about Joppa. On the north of Ephraim and Manasseh were the tribes of Asher, Zebulun and Issachar. The territory thus allotted to the "house of Joseph" may be roughly estimated at 55 miles from east to west by 70 from north to south. It was one at once of great richness and great security. Its fertile plains and well-watered valleys could only be reached by a laborious ascent through steep and narrow ravines, all but impassable for an army. Under Joshua the tribe must have taken a high position in the nation, to judge from the tone which the Ephraimites assumed on occasions shortly subsequent to the conquest. After the revolt of Jeroboam the history of Ephraim is the history of the kingdom of Israel, since not only did the tribe become a kingdom, but the kingdom embraced little besides the tribe. </FONT></body></html>
