Whether this mode of execution was known to the ancient Jews is a matter of dispute. Probably the Jews borrowed it from the Romans. It was unanimously considered the most horrible form of death. Among the Romans the degradation was also a part of the infliction, and the punishment if applied to freemen was only used in the case of the vilest criminals. The one to be crucified was stripped naked of all his clothes, and then followed the most awful moment of all. He was laid down upon the implement of torture. His arms were stretched along the cross-beams, and at the centre of the open palms the point of a huge iron nail was placed, which, by the blow of a mallet, was driven home into the wood. Then through either foot separately, or possibly through both together, as they were placed one over the other, another huge nail tore its way through the quivering flesh. Whether the sufferer was also bound to the cross we do not know; but, to prevent the hands and feet being torn away by the weight of the body, which could not "rest upon nothing but four great wounds," there was, about the centre of the cross, a wooden projection strong enough to support, at least in part, a human body, which soon became a weight of agony. Then the "accursed tree" with its living human burden was slowly heaved up and the end fixed firmly in a hole in the ground. The feet were but a little raised above the earth. The victim was in full reach of every hand that might choose to strike. A death by crucifixion seems to include all that pain and death can have of the horrible and ghastly, --dizziness, cramp, thirst, starvation, sleeplessness, traumatic fever, tetanus, publicity of shame, long continuance of torment, horror of anticipation, mortification of untended wounds, all intensified just up to the point at which they can be endured at all, but all stopping just short of the point which would give to the sufferer the relief of unconsciousness. The unnatural position made every movement painful; the lacerated veins and crushed tendons throbbed with incessant anguish; the wounds, inflamed by exposure, gradually gangrened; the arteries, especially of the head and stomach, became swollen and oppressed with surcharged blood; and, while each variety of misery went on gradually increasing, there was added to them the intolerable pang of a burning and raging thirst. Such was the death to which Christ was doomed. --<I>Farrars "Life of Christ.</I> " The crucified was watched, according to custom, by a party of four soldiers, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/19-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/19-23.html">John 19:23</a> ) with their centurion, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-66.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-66.html">Matthew 27:66</a> ) whose express office was to prevent the stealing of the body. This was necessary from the lingering character of the death, which sometimes did not supervene even for three days, and was at last the result of gradual benumbing and starvation. But for this guard, the persons might have been taken down and recovered, as was actually done in the case of a friend of Josephus. Fracture of the legs was especially adopted by the Jews to hasten death. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/19-31.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/19-31.html">John 19:31</a> ) In most cases the body was suffered to rot on the cross by the action of sun and rain, or to be devoured by birds and beasts. Sepulture was generally therefore forbidden; but in consequence of ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/21-22.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/21-22.html">deuteronomy 21:22</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/21-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/21-23.html">deuteronomy 21:23</a> ) an express national exception was made in favor of the Jews. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-58.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-58.html">Matthew 27:58</a> ) This accursed and awful mode of punishment was happily abolished by Constantine. </FONT></body></html>
