            <P><B>HEBER</B><P> he'-ber (chebher, "associate" or, possibly, "enchanter"; Eber):
<P> A name occurring several times in the Old Testament as the name of an individual or of a clan.
<P> (1) A member of the tribe of Asher and son of Beraiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+46:17">Genesis 46:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+26:45">Numbers 26:45</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:31">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:31</A>).
<P> (2) A Kenite, husband of Jael, who deceptively slew Sisera, captain of the army of Jabin, a Canaanite king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+4:17">Judges 4:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+5:24">5:24</A>). He had separated himself from the main body of the Kenites, which accounts for his tent being near Kedesh, the place of Sisera's disastrous battle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+4:11">Judges 4:11</A>).
<P> (3) Head of a clan of Judah, and son of Mered by his Jewish, as distinguished from an Egyptian wife. He was father, or founder, of Soco (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:18">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:18</A>).
<P> (4) A Benjamite, or clan or family of Elpaal belonging to Benjamin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:17</A>).
<P> (5) Heber, of our Lord's genealogy (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+3:35">Luke 3:35</A> the King James Version), better, Eber.
<P> So, the name "Eber," `ebher, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:13">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:22">8:22</A>, is not to be confused with Heber, chebher, as in the foregoing passages.
