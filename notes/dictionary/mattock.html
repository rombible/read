            <P><B>MATTOCK</B><P> mat'-ok:
<P> The translation of 3 Hebrew words:
<P> (1) machereshah, probably "a pick-axe" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+13:20,21">1&nbsp;Samuel 13:20,21</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+13:21">1&nbsp;Samuel 13:21</A> margin);
<P> (2) cherebh, "sword," "ax," "tool" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:6">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:6</A> the King James Version, "with their mattocks," the King James Version margin "mauls," the Revised Version (British and American) "in their ruins," the Revised Version margin "with their axes");
<P> (3) ma`-der, "a hoe," "rake," "chopping instrument" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:25">Isaiah 7:25</A>). Vines were usually grown on terraces on the hills of Palestine, and then the mattock was in constant use. The usual mattock is a pick with one end broad, the other pointed.
