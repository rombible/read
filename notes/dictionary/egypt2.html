Its limits appear always to have been very nearly the same. It is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Sea, on the east by Palestine, Arabia and the Red Sea, on the south by Nubia, and on the west by the Great Desert. It is divided into upper Egypt --the valley of the Nile --and lower Egypt, the plain of the Delta, from the Greek letter; it is formed by the branching mouths of the Nile, and the Mediterranean Sea. The portions made fertile by the Nile comprise about 9582 square geographical miles, of which only about 5600 is under cultivation. --Encyc. Brit. The Delta extends about 200 miles along the Mediterranean, and Egypt is 520 miles long from north to south from the sea to the First Cataract. <B><a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/smiths-bible-dictionary/names.html" target="_blank" url="names.html">NAMES</a></B>. --The common name of Egypt in the Bible is "Mizraim." It is in the dual number, which indicates the two natural divisions of the country into an upper and a lower region. The Arabic name of Egypt --<I>Mizr</I> -- signifies "red mud." Egypt is also called in the Bible "the land of Ham," ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/105-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/105-23.html">Psalms 105:23</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/105-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/105-27.html">Psalms 105:27</a> ) comp.
