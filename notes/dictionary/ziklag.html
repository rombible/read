            <P><B>ZIKLAG</B><P> zik'-lag (tsiqelagh, tsiqelagh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+1:1">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:1</A>), tsiqelagh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:1,20">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:1,20</A>); usually in the Septuagint Sekelak, or Sikelag):
<P> A town assigned (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:5">Joshua 19:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:30">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:30</A>) to Simeon, but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:31">Joshua 15:31</A> named, between Hornah and Madmannah, as one of the cities of the Negeb of Judah, "toward the border of Edom." It is said (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+27:6">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:6</A>) to have remained a royal city. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:28">Nehemiah 11:28</A> it is in the list of towns reinhabited by the returning children of Judah. Its chief associations are with David. Achish the Philistine king of Gath gave it to David as a residence (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+27:6">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:1,20">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:1,20</A>); it was raided by the Amalekites, on whom David took vengeance and so recovered his property (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:14,26">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:14,26</A>); here the messenger who came to announce Saul's death was slain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+1:1">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+4:10">4:10</A>).
<P> The site of this important place is not yet fixed with certainty; Conder proposed Zucheilika, a ruin 11 miles South-Southeast of Gaza, and 4 miles North of Wady es-Sheri'a, which may be the "Brook Besor" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:9,10,21">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:9,10,21</A>); Rowland (1842) proposed `Asluj, a heap of ruins South of Beersheba and 7 miles to the East of Bered. Neither site is entirely satisfactory. See Williams, Holy City, I, 463-68; BR, II, 201, PEF, 288, Sh XX.
