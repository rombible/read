            <P><B>ASHURITES</B><P> ash'-ur-its (ha-'ashuri):
<P> According to the Massoretic Text of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+2:9">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:9</A>, a tribe included in the short-lived kingdom of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. A slight textual correction gives "Asherites," that is, the tribe of Asher; with this the Targum of Jonathan agrees. The tribe of Asher lay where it would naturally fall to Ish-bosheth's kingdom. The reading "Geshurites" (Vulgate and Syriac) is excluded by the known independence Of Geshur at this time (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+3:3">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:37">13:37</A>). For similar reasons we cannot think of Assyria (Hebrew Asshur) nor of the Arabic Asshurim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:3">Genesis 25:3</A>.
