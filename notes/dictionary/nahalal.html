            <P><B>NAHALAL</B><P> na'-hal-al (nachalal; Codex Vaticanus, Baithman; Codex Alexandrinus Naalol, and other forms):
<P> A city in the territory of Zebulun assigned with its suburbs to the Merarite Levites, out of which the Canaanite inhabitants were not driven (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:15">Joshua 19:15</A>, the King James Version (incorrectly) "Nahallal"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:35">Joshua 21:35</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:30">Judges 1:30</A>, "Nahalol"). In the Talmud Jerusalem (Meg., i.1) it is identified with Mahlul. This name might correspond either with `Ain Mahil, or with Ma`lul. The former lies about 3 1/2 miles Northeast of Nazareth on a hill near the eastern boundary of Zebulun. The latter is situated about 3 1/2 miles West of Nazareth, near the southern border of Zebulun. The change of "n" to "m" is not unusual.
