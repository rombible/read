Its author was Moses. It was written probably during the forty-years wanderings int he wilderness, between B.C. 1491 and 1451. It may be divided into two principal parts: <OL><LI>Historical, chs. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Exodus+1:1-18" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+1:1-18&amp;t=niv">Exodus 1:1-18</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/27-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/27-1.html">27:1</a> ) ... and <LI>Legislative, chs. ( Exodus 19:40 ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/38-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/38-1.html">38:1</a> ) <LI>The first part contains an account of the following particulars: the great increase of Jacobs posterity in the land of Egypt, and their oppression under a new dynasty, which occupied the throne after the death of Joseph; the birth, education, flight and return of Moses; the ineffectual attempts to prevail upon Pharaoh to let the Israelites go; the successive signs and wonders, ending in the death of the first-born, by means of which the deliverance of Israel from the land of bondage is at length accomplished, and the institution of the Passover; finally the departure out of Egypt and the arrival of the Israelites at Mount Sinai. <LI>This part gives a sketch of the early history of Israel as a nation; and the history has three clearly-marked stages. First we see a nation enslaved; next a nation redeemed; lastly a nation set apart, and through the blending of its religious and political life consecrated to the service of God. </OL></FONT></body></html>
