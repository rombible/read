            <P><B>REUEL</B><P> roo'-el (re`u'el, "God is his friend"; the Septuagint Rhagouel):
<P> (1) In the genealogical system Reuel is both a son of Esau by Basemath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:4,10,13,17">Genesis 36:4,10,13,17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:35,37">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:35,37</A>) and the father of the father-in-law of Moses, Hobab (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:29">Numbers 10:29</A>). In the account of the marriage of Zipporah to Moses (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:16-21">Exodus 2:16-21</A>) Jethro seems to be called Reuel (compare HOBAB). The various names of Jethro perplexed the Talmudists, too; some held that his real name was "Hobab," and that Reuel was his father. Reuel is probably a clan name (Gray, "Nu," ICC), and Hobab is a member of the clan ("son") of Reuel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:29">Numbers 10:29</A>, the King James Version reads "Raguel").
<P> (2) The father of Eliasaph, the prince of Gad (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+2:14">Numbers 2:14</A>), called (by some copyist's mistake) "Deuel" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+1:14">Numbers 1:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+7:42,47">7:42,47</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:20">10:20</A>. The Septuagint has uniformly Rhagouel.
<P> (3) A Benjamite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:8">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:8</A>).
