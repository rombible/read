<LI>A descendant of Joseph the son of Jacob, and head of one of the families of Manasseh that settled West of the Jordan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+26:30">Numbers 26:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+17:1-6">Joshua 17:1-6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:14-19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:14-19</A>). As he was great uncle to Zelophehad's daughters, who brought a case before Moses (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+36">Numbers 36</A>), he must have been an old man at the time of the conquest. He was the son of Gilead the son of Machir, in the sense of being a more remote descendant, for Machir had sons before the death of Joseph (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+50:23">Genesis 50:23</A>). The Machir that possessed Gilead and Bashan because he was "a man of war" was the Manassite family of Machir, with Jair as its great general (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+17:1">Joshua 17:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:30,31">13:30,31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:39-41">Numbers 32:39-41</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:12-15">Deuteronomy 3:12-15</A>). To Abiezer and other sons of Gilead territory was assigned West of the Jordan.
<P> In later generations the name survived as that of the family to which Gideon belonged, and perhaps also of the region which they occupied (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+6:34">Judges 6:34</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:2">8:2</A>). They are also called Abiezrites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+6:11,24">Judges 6:11,24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:32">8:32</A>). The region was West of Shechem, with Ophrah for its principal city.
<P>
<LI>One of David's mighty men, "the Anathothite" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:27">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:28">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:28</A>), who was also one of David s month-by-month captains, his month being the ninth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:12</A>).
