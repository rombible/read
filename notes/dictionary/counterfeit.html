<P> "Counterfeit" occurs as the translation of kibdelos, "mixed with dross," "not genuine" (The Wisdom of Solomon 15:9, "to make counterfeit things," the Revised Version (British and American) "mouldeth counterfeits," "spurious things, imitations"); 2:16 the Revised Version (British and American) "base metal" (compare Septuagint <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+19:19">Leviticus 19:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+22:11">Deuteronomy 22:11</A>, "mingled garment," and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+13:5,6">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:5,6</A>, adokimos, "reprobate" (silver)). "Counterfeit" in the older sense of a representation occurs in The Wisdom of Solomon 14:17 (anatupoo, "to make a likeness"), "counterfeit of his visage," the Revised Version (British and American) "imagining the likeness from afar," and Ecclesiasticus 38:27 (homoioo, "to make like"), "to counterfeit imagery," the Revised Version (British and American) "to preserve likeness in his portraiture."
