            <P><B>SALOME</B><P> sa-lo'-me (Salome):
<P> (1) One of the holy women who companied with Jesus in Galilee, and ministered to Him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+15:40,41">Mark 15:40,41</A>). She was present at the crucifixion (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</A>), and was among those who came to the tomb of Jesus on the resurrection morning (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+16:1,2">Mark 16:1,2</A>). Comparison with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:56">Matthew 27:56</A> clearly identifies her with the wife of Zebedee. It is she, therefore, whose ambitious request for her sons James and John is recorded in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+20:20-24">Matthew 20:20-24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:35-40">Mark 10:35-40</A>. From <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+19:25">John 19:25</A> many infer that she was a sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus (thus Meyer, Luthardt, Alford); others (as Godet) dispute the inference.
<P> (2) Salome was the name of the daughter of Herodias who danced before Herod, and obtained as reward the head of John the Baptist (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+14:3-11">Matthew 14:3-11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:17-28">Mark 6:17-28</A>; compare Josephus, Ant, XVIII, v, 4). She is not named in the Gospels.
