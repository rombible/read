            <P><B>ABIDE</B><P> a-bid':
<P> Old English word signifying progressively to "await," "remain," "lodge," "sojourn," "dwell," "continue," "endure"; represented richly in Old Testament (King James Version) by 12 Hebrew and in New Testament by as many Greek words. In the Revised Version (British and American) displaced often by words meaning "to sojourn," "dwell," "encamp." The Hebrew and Greek originals in most frequent use are yashabh, "to dwell"; meno, "to remain." "Abide (sit or tarry) ye here" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+22:5">Genesis 22:5</A>); "The earth abide (continueth) forever" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+1:4">Ecclesiastes 1:4</A>); "Who can abide (bear or endure) the day?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mal+3:2">Malachi 3:2</A>); "Afflictions abide (await) me" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</A>). The past tense abode, in frequent use, has the same meaning. "His bow abide (remained) in strength" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+49:24">Genesis 49:24</A>); "There he abide" (dwelt) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:40">John 10:40</A>).
<P> Abode, as a noun (Greek mone) twice in New Testament:
<P> "make our abide with him" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+14:23">John 14:23</A>); "mansions," the Revised Version, margin "abiding-places" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+14:2">John 14:2</A>). The soul of the true disciple and heaven are dwelling-places of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
<P> Dwight M. Pratt
