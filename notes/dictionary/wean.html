            <P><B>WEAN</B><P> wen:
<P> "To wean" in English Versions of the Bible is always the translation of (gamal), but gamal has a much wider force than merely "to wean," signifying "to deal fully with," as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+13:6">Psalms 13:6</A>, etc. Hence, as applied to a child, gamal covers the whole period of nursing and care until the weaning is complete (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+11:20">1&nbsp;Kings 11:20</A>). This period in ancient Israel extended to about 3 years, and when it was finished the child was mature enough to be entrusted to strangers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:24">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:24</A>). And, as the completion of the period marked the end of the most critical stage of the child's life, it was celebrated with a feast (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+21:8">Genesis 21:8</A>), a custom still observed in the Orient. The weaned child, no longer fretting for the breast and satisfied with its mother's affection, is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+131:2">Psalms 131:2</A> as a figure for Israel's contentment with God's care, despite the smallness of earthly possessions. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:9">Isaiah 28:9</A> there is an ironical question, `Is God to teach you knowledge as if you were children? You should have learned His will long ago!'
