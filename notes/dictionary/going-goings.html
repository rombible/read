            <P><B>GOING; GOINGS</B><P> go'-ing, go'-ingz:
<P> Besides, occasionally, forms of the common words for "go" (see Go), for "going" and "goings," the Hebrew has 'ashshur ('ashur, 'ashur), "step," motsa', totsa'oth, "goings out," "outgoings." The word "goings" is sometimes used literally, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:2">Numbers 33:2</A>, "Moses wrote their goings out" (Hebrew motsa'). "Going up," ma`aleh, is in many passages rendered in the Revised Version (British and American) (as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:4">Numbers 34:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+15:30">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:30</A> the King James Version) "ascent," as e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:7">Joshua 15:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:36">Judges 1:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:37">Nehemiah 12:37</A> (the American Standard Revised Version only). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+44:5">Ezekiel 44:5</A>, the American Standard Revised Version substitutes "egress" (way out or place of exit) for "going forth." "The goings out (place of exit; hence, boundary) of it" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:4,5,9,12">Numbers 34:4,5,9,12</A> the King James Version) occurs frequently. The verbal forms bo', mabho', also me`al (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+6:14">Daniel 6:14</A>), are used of the sunset, "the going down of the sun." Thus <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+8:29">Joshua 8:29</A> the Revised Version (British and American), the King James Version "as soon as the sun was down."
<P> In the New Testament, the Revised Version (British and American) substitutes "going out" for "gone out" (sbennumi) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+25:8">Matthew 25:8</A>); "going up" for "ascending" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:28">Luke 19:28</A>); "going in" for "coming in" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+9:28">Acts 9:28</A>); "going about" for "wandering" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:13">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:13</A>); "seeking" for "going about" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+10:3">Romans 10:3</A>).
<P> Metaphorically:
<P> "Goings" is used for a man's ways or conduct (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+17:5">Psalms 17:5</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "steps"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+40:2">Psalms 40:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+14:15">Proverbs 14:15</A>, etc.). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+17:5">Psalms 17:5</A> "Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not" becomes in the Revised Version (British and American) "My steps have held fast to thy paths, my feet have not slipped"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+5:21">Proverbs 5:21</A>, "He pondereth all his goings," is in the Revised Version (British and American) "He maketh level all his paths," in "weigheth carefully"; conversely, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+37:23">Psalms 37:23</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) has "goings" for "steps"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:11">James 1:11</A> "goings" for "ways." In the important prophetic passage, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</A>, it is said of the Ruler from Bethlehem, "whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting," the Revised Version (British and American) "are from of old, from everlasting," margin "from ancient days." Of God it is said in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+3:6">Habakkuk 3:6</A> "His ways are everlasting," the Revised Version (British and American) "His goings were as of old," margin "His ways are everlasting."
