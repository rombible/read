            <P><B>HISS</B><P> his (sharaq):
<P> "To hiss" has two applications:
<P> (1) to call,
<P> (2) to express contempt or scorn.
<P> (1) It is the translation of sharaq, a mimetic word meaning to hiss or whistle, to call (bees, etc.), (a) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+5:26">Isaiah 5:26</A>, "I will hiss unto them from the ends of the earth," the Revised Version (British and American) "hiss for them (margin "him") from the end of the earth"; 7:18, "Yahweh will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria"; namely, Egyptians whose land was noted for flies (18:1) and Assyrians whose country was pre-eminently one of bees. Dangerous enemies are compared to bees in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:44">Deuteronomy 1:44</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+118:12">Psalms 118:12</A> (Skinner's Isaiah):
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+10:8">Zechariah 10:8</A>, "I will hiss for them, and gather them" (His own people, who will come at His call).
<P> (2) More often, to hiss is to express contempt or derision (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+9:8">1&nbsp;Kings 9:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+27:23">Job 27:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+19:8">Jeremiah 19:8</A>, etc.). In this sense we have also frequently a hissing (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:8">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+19:8">Jeremiah 19:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+25:9,18">25:9,18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+29:18">29:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+51:37">51:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+6:16">Micah 6:16</A>, shereqah); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+18:16">Jeremiah 18:16</A>, sheriqoth or sheruqoth; Ecclesiasticus 22:1, "Every one will hiss him (the slothful man) out in his disgrace" (eksurisso, "to hiss out"); The Wisdom of Solomon 17:9, "hissing of serpents" (surigmos).
