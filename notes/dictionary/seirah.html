            <P><B>SEIRAH</B><P> se-i'-ra, se'-i-ra (ha-se`irah; Codex Vaticanus Seteirotha; Codex Alexandrinus Seeirotha; the King James Version, Seirath):
<P> The place to which Ehud escaped after his assassination of Eglon, king of Moab (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:26">Judges 3:26</A>). The name is from the same root as the foregoing, and probably applied to some shaggy forest. The quarries by which he passed are said to have been by Gilgal (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:19">Judges 3:19</A>), but there is nothing to guide us to an identification. Eusebius, in Onomasticon, gives the name, but no indication of the site.
