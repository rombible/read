            <P><B>MILK</B><P> milk (chalabh; gala; Latin lac (2 Esdras 2:19; 8:10)):
<P> The fluid secreted by the mammary glands of female mammals for the nourishment of their young. The word is used in the Bible of that of human beings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:9">Isaiah 28:9</A>) as well as of that of the lower animals (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+23:19">Exodus 23:19</A>). As a food it ranked next in importance to bread (Ecclesiasticus 39:26). Palestine is frequently described as a land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+3:8,17">Exodus 3:8,17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+13:27">Numbers 13:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+6:3">Deuteronomy 6:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+5:6">Joshua 5:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+11:5">Jeremiah 11:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+20:6,15">Ezekiel 20:6,15</A>). Milk was among the first things set before the weary traveler (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+18:8">Genesis 18:8</A>). In fact, it was considered a luxury (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+5:25">Judges 5:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:1">Song of Solomon 5:1</A>). The people used the milk of kine and also that of sheep (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:14">Deuteronomy 32:14</A>), and especially that of goats (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+27:27">Proverbs 27:27</A>). It was received in pails ('atinim, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+21:24">Job 21:24</A>), and kept in leather bottles (no'dh, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+4:19">Judges 4:19</A>), where it turned sour quickly in the warm climate of Palestine before being poured out thickly like a melting substance (nathakh; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+10:10">Job 10:10</A>). Cheese of various kinds was made from it (gebhinah and charitse he-chalabh, literally, "cuts of milk"); or the curds (chem'ah) were eaten with bread, and possibly also made into butter by churning (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:33">Proverbs 30:33</A>). See FOOD, II. It is possible that milk was used for seething other substances; at least the Israelites were strictly forbidden to seethe a kid in its mother's milk (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+23:19">Exodus 23:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+34:26">34:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:21">Deuteronomy 14:21</A>), and by a very general interpretation of these passages Jews have come to abstain from the use of mixtures of meat and milk of all kinds.
<P> Figuratively the word is used
<P> (1) of abundance (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+49:12">Genesis 49:12</A>);
<P> (2) of a loved one's charms (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+4:11">Song of Solomon 4:11</A>);
<P> (3) of blessings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joe+3:18">Joel 3:18</A>);
<P> (4) of the (spiritual) food of immature people (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+3:2">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+5:12,13">Hebrews 5:12,13</A>);
<P> (5) of purity (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:2">1&nbsp;Peter 2:2</A>).
