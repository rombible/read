            <P><B>NEBO (2)</B><P> (nebho; Nabau):
<P> (1) This town is named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:3">Numbers 32:3</A> between Sebam and Beon (which latter evidently represents Baal-meon of 32:38), after Heshbon and Elealeh, as among the cities assigned by Moses to Reuben. It was occupied by the Reubenite clan Bela (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:8">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:8</A>). Here it is named between Aroer and Baalmeon. In their denunciations of wrath against Moab, Isaiah names it along with Medeba (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:2">Isaiah 15:2</A>) and Jeremiah with Kiriathaim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:1">Jeremiah 48:1</A>), and again (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:22">Jeremiah 48:22</A>) between Dibon and Beth-diblathaim. Mesha (M S) says that by command of Chemosh he went by night against the city, captured it after an assault that lasted from dawn till noon, and put all the inhabitants to death. He dedicated the place to Ashtar-chemosh. Jerome (Commentary on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:2">Isaiah 15:2</A>) tells us that at Nebo was the idol of Chemosh. The site which seems best to meet the requirements of the passages indicated is on the ridge of Jebel Neba to the Southwest of Hesban, where ruins of an ancient town bearing the name of en-Neba are found (Buhl, GAP, 266).
<P> (2) (nebho; B, Nabou A, Nabo, and other forms):
<P> Fifty-two descendants of the inhabitants of Nebo returned from exile with Zerubbabel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:29">Ezra 2:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:33">Nehemiah 7:33</A>). The place was in Judah and is named after Bethel and Ai. There is nothing, however, to guide us as to its exact position. It may be represented by either Belt Nuba, 12 miles Northwest of Jerusalem, or Nuba, which lies about 4 miles South-Southeast of `Id el-Ma' (Adullam).
