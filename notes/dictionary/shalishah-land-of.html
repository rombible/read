            <P><B>SHALISHAH, LAND OF</B><P> sha-li'-sha, shal'-i-sha ('erets shalishah; Codex Vaticanus he ge Selcha; Codex Alexandrinus he ge Salissa):
<P> If the general indication of the route followed by Saul, given under SHAALIM, is correct, the land of Shalishah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+9:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 9:4</A>) will lie to the Northeast of Lydda on the western slope of the range. Baal-shalishah would most likely be in the district, and may indeed have given its name to it. If Conder is right in identifying this city with Khirbet Kefr Thilth, about 19 miles Northeast of Jaffa, it meets well enough the general indication given above. Eusebius, Onomasticon knows the name, but gives no guidance as to where the district is. Baal-shalishah it places in the Thamnite region, 15 miles North of Diospolis (Lydda). No boundaries can be laid down, but probability points to this neighborhood.
<P> W. Ewing
