            <P><B>ELDAD</B><P> el'-dad ('eldadh, "God has loved"):
<P> One of the 70 elders chosen by Moses at the command of Yahweh to share "the burden of the people" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:16-25">Numbers 11:16-25</A>). Eldad and his companion Medad were not present with the rest at the tent of meeting, yet the Spirit rested also upon them and they prophesied in the camp (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:26-29">Numbers 11:26-29</A>).
