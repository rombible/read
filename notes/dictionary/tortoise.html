            <P><B>TORTOISE</B><P> tor'-tus, tor'-tis, tor'-tois. (the King James Version) (tsabh, the Revised Version (British and American) "great lizard"; compare the Arabic word, dabb, the thorny-tailed lizard):
<P> The word tsabh occurs as the name of an animal only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:29">Leviticus 11:29</A>, being the third in the list of unclean "creeping things."
<P> The same word is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+66:20">Isaiah 66:20</A>, translated "litters," and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+7:3">Numbers 7:3</A>, where `eghloth tsabh is translated "covered wagons." Gesenius derives the word, in all senses, from the root cabhabh, "to move gently," "to flow"; compare Arabic dabba, "to flow." The Arabic noun dabb is Uromastix spinipes, the Arabian thorny-tailed lizard. This lizard is about 18 inches long, its relatively smooth body being terminated with a great tail armed with rings of spiny scales. The Arabs have a familiar proverb, 'a`kad min dhanab ud-dabb, "knottier than the tail of the dabb." The Septuagint has for tsabh in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:29">Leviticus 11:29</A> ho krokodeilos ho chersaios, the English equivalent of which, "land-crocodile," is used by the Revised Version (British and American) for the fifth in the list of unclean "creeping things," koach, the King James Version "chameleon."
<P> The writer does not know what can have led the translators of the King James Version to use here the word "tortoise." Assuming that the thorny-tailed lizard is meant, the "great lizard" of the Revised Version (British and American) may be considered to be a fair translation.
