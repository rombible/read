( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/36-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/36-2.html">Jeremiah 36:2</a> ) Apparently the prophets kept written records of their predictions, and collected into larger volumes such of them as were intended for permanent use." --Canon Cook. In the present order we have two great divisions:-- I. Chs. 1-45. Prophecies delivered at various times, directed mainly to Judah, or connected with Jeremiahs personal history. II. Chs. 46-51. Prophecies connected with other nations. Looking more closely into each of these divisions, we have the following sections: <OL><LI>Chs. 1-21, including prophecies from the thirteenth year of Josiah to the fourth of Jehoiakim; ch. 21; belongs to the later period. <LI>Chs. 22-25. Shorter prophecies, delivered at different times, against the kings of Judah and the false prophets. Ch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/25-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/25-13.html">Jeremiah 25:13</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/25-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/25-14.html">Jeremiah 25:14</a> ) evidently marks the conclusion of a series of prophecies; and that which follows, ch. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Jeremiah+25:15-38" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+25:15-38&amp;t=niv">Jeremiah 25:15-38</a> ) the germ of the fuller predictions in chs. 46-49, has been placed here as a kind of completion to the prophecy of the seventy years and the subsequent fall of Babylon. <LI>Chs. 26-28. The two great prophecies of the fall of Jerusalem, and the history connected with them. <LI>Chs. 29-31. The message of comfort for the exiles in Babylon. <LI>Chs. 32-44. The history of the last two years before the capture of Jerusalem, and of Jeremiahs work int hem and in the period that followed. <LI>Chs. 46-51. The prophecies against foreign nations, ending with the great prediction against Babylon. <LI>The supplementary narrative of ch. 52. </OL></FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
