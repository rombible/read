            <P><B>JOSIPHIAH</B><P> jos-i-fi'-a (yociphyah, "Yah adds"):
<P> Found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:10">Ezra 8:10</A>, where Massoretic Text is "and of the sons of .... Shelomith the son of Josiphiah." With the help of Septuagint A and 1 Esdras 8:36, the name "Bani" (which is the same in the unpointed text as "the sons of" and was omitted through haplography) can be supplied above before "Shelomith." Josiphia is thus the father of Shelomith, one of Ezra's companions. 1 Esdras 8:36 has "Josaphias."
