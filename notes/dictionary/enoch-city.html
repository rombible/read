            <P><B>ENOCH (CITY)</B><P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+4:17">Genesis 4:17</A> it is narrated that Cain, who had taken up his abode in the land of Nod, East of Eden (verse 16), built there a city, and called it after the name of his firstborn son Enoch. It is impossible to fix more definitely the locality of this first of cities, recorded, as Delitzsch says (Genesis, in the place cited.), as registering an advance in civilization. The "city" would be a very simple affair, a place of protection for himself, wife and household, perhaps connected with the fear spoken of in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+4:14">Genesis 4:14</A>.
