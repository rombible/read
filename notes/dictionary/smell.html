            <P><B>SMELL</B><P> smel (Hebrew and Aramaic reach, as noun, "savor," "scent"; ruach, as verb, literally, "to breathe," "to inhale," thence "to smell"; osme, the "smell," "savor," euodia, "sweet smell" "fragrance" osphresis "the sense of smell"; verb osphrainomai):
<P> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled (way-yarach) the smell (reach) of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell (reach) of my son is as the smell (reach) of a field which Yahweh hath blessed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+27:27" target="_blank">Genesis 27:27</A>). Idols are described as "gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+4:28">Deuteronomy 4:28</A>). Acceptable sacrifices and pious conduct are called a "sweet smell" or "savor" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+29:18">Exodus 29:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</A>) well-pleasing to God. The godless life, which dishonors God, is hateful to Him: "I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+26:31">Leviticus 26:31</A>). The phrase, "being in bad odor with a person," can be traced to Biblical language: "Ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+5:21">Exodus 5:21</A>). Thus "smell" is occasionally equivalent with "quality," "character": "His (Moab's) taste remaineth in him, and his scent is not changed" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:11">Jeremiah 48:11</A>). Character or quality is the most infallible test, the most manifest advertisement of a thing or a person; thus we find the following very instructive passage: "(God) maketh manifest through us the savor (osme) of his knowledge in every place. For we are a sweet savor (euodia) of Christ unto God, in (better: "among") them that are saved, and in (better: "among") them that perish; to the one a savor (osme) from death unto death; to the other a savor (osme) from life unto life" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+2:14-16">2&nbsp;Corinthians 2:14-16</A>). See <a href="triumph.html">TRIUMPH</a>. In the passage <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:24">Isaiah 3:24</A>, the King James Version "sweet smell" (besem, "balsam plant") has been changed to "sweet spices" in the Revised Version (British and American).
