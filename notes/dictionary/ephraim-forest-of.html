            <P><B>EPHRAIM, FOREST OF</B><P> (ya`ar 'ephrayim):
<P> The word ya`ar (Hebrew) probably agrees in meaning with the Arabic wa`r, which indicates a rough country, abounding in rocks, stones and scrub, with occasional trees; not a "forest," as we understand the term. Here Absalom was defeated and slain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:6">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:6</A>, the King James Version "wood of Ephraim"). It must be sought, therefore, East of the Jordan, in the neighborhood of Mahanaim; but no identification is yet possible.
