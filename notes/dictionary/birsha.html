            <P><B>BIRSHA</B><P> bur'-sha (birsha`):
<P> King of Gomorrah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:2">Genesis 14:2</A>), who joined the league against Chedorlaomer. The name is probably corrupt; some have tried to explain it as beresha`, "with wickedness," a name purposely used by the writer in referring to this king.
