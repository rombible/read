            <P><B>DISAPPOINT</B><P> dis-a-point':
<P> "To disappoint" may be used transitively or intransitively. In the former case it naturally has a more forceful meaning. Therefore the Revised Version (British and American) changes the translation of the King James Version wherever "disappoint" is used with an object: <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+5:12">Job 5:12</A>, "frustrateth"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+17:13">Psalms 17:13</A>, "confront him," the Revised Version, margin "forestall"; Judith 16:6, "brought them to nought"; but the Revised Version (British and American) retains "disappoint" where the person wh disappoints is not expressed. Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+15:22">Proverbs 15:22</A>.
