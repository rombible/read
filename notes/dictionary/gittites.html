            <P><B>GITTITES</B><P> git'-its (gittim, plural of gittiy):
<P> The inhabitants of Gath. They are mentioned along with the inhabitants of the other chief Philistine cities in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:3">Joshua 13:3</A>. It would seem that numbers of them emigrated to Judah, for we find 600 of them acting as a bodyguard to David with Ittai at their head (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+15:18">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:2">18:2</A>). Obed-edom, to whom David entrusted the ark when he was frustrated in bringing it into the city of David, was a Gittite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:11">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+13:13">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:13</A>). The Gittites seem to have been remarkable for their great stature (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:19">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+20:5">1&nbsp;Chronicles 20:5</A>).
