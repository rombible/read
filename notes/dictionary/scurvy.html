            <P><B>SCURVY</B><P> skur'-vi (garabh); psora agria (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:20">Leviticus 21:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+22:22">22:22</A>)):
<P> This word is used to denote an itchy, scaly disease of the scalp, probably any of the parasitic diseases which are known as tinea, porrigo or impetigo. These cases have no relation whatever to the disease now known as scorbutus or scurvy. The name was probably derived from its scaliness, and the old Greek physicians believed these diseases to be peculiarly intractable.
<P> The name "Gareb" is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+31:39">Jeremiah 31:39</A> as the placename of a hill at or near the southeastern corner of Jerusalem, probably from the bare roughness of the surface of its slope at the southern end of the Wady er-Rababi. Another hill of this name is mentioned near Shiloh in the Talmud, and the name is given to one of David's warriors (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:38">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:38</A>).
<P> Scurvy etymologically means any condition of scaliness of skin which can be scraped off, such as dandruff.
