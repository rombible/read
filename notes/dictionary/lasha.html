            <P><B>LASHA</B><P> la'-sha (lasha`):
<P> A place named on the southern boundary of the Canaanites along with Gomorrah, Adnah and Zeboiim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:19">Genesis 10:19</A>). Eusebius, Onomasticon identifies it with the hot springs at Callirrhoe in Wady Zerqa Ma`in, on the East of the Dead Sea; in this agreeing with Targum Jerusalem. This position, however, seems too far to the North, and possibly the site should be sought on the West of the Arabah. The absence of the article (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:2">Joshua 15:2</A>) prevents identification with the promontory el-Lisan, which runs into the sea from the eastern shore. Wellhausen (Comp. des Hexateuch., 15) thinks we should read lesham, since the Hebrew letters, "m" (mem) and " ` " (`ayin), are like each other in their Palmyrene form. We should then have indicated the boundary from Gaza to the Dead Sea, and then from the Dead Sea to Leshem, i.e. Dan. This is very precarious. No identification is possible.
