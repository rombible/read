These consist of two circular stones, each about eighteen inches or two feet in diameter, the lower of which is fixed, and has its upper surface slightly convex, fitting into a corresponding concavity in the upper stone. In the latter is a hole thorough which the grain passes, immediately above a pivot or shaft which rises from the centre of the lower stone, and about which the upper stone is turned by means of an upright handle fixed near the edge. It is worked by women, sometimes singly and sometimes two together, who are usually seated on the bare ground. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/47-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/47-1.html">Isaiah 47:1</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/47-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/47-2.html">Isaiah 47:2</a> ) "facing each other; both have hold of the handle by which the upper is turned round on the nether millstone. The one whose right hand is disengaged throws in the grain as occasion requires through the hole in the upper stone. It is not correct to say that one pushes it half round and then the other seizes the handle. This would be slow work, and would give a spasmodic motion to the stone. Both retain their hold, and pull <I>to</I> or push <I>from</I> , as men do with the whip or cross-cut saw. The proverb of our Saviour, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/24-41.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/24-41.html">Matthew 24:41</a> ) is true to life, for <I>women</I> only grind. I cannot recall an instance in which men were at the mill." --Thomson, "The Land and the Book," c.34. So essential were millstones for daily domestic use that they were forbidden to be taken in pledge. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/24-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/24-6.html"> 24:6</a> ) There were also larger mills that could only be turned by cattle or asses. Allusion to one of these is made in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/18-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/18-6.html">Matthew 18:6</a> ) With the movable upper millstone of the hand-mill the woman of Thebez broke Abimelechs skull.
