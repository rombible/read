            <P><B>KERIOTH</B><P> ke'-ri-oth, -oth (qeriyoth):
<P> (1) A city of Moab, named with Beth-meon and Bozrah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:24,41">Jeremiah 48:24,41</A>). Here was a sanctuary of Chemosh, to which Mesha says (M S, l. 13) he dragged "the altar hearths of Davdoh." It may possibly be represented by the modern Kuraiat, between Diban and `Attarus. Some (e.g. Driver on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+2:2">Amos 2:2</A>) think it may be only another name for Ar-Moab. Buhl (GAP, 270) would identify it with Kir of Moab (Kerak). No certainty is yet possible.
<P> (2) A city of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:25">Joshua 15:25</A>; the Revised Version (British and American) KERIOTH-HEZRON (which see)), possibly the modern el-Kuryatain, to the Northeast of Tell `Arad.
