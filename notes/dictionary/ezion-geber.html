<P> Always mentioned along with Elath ("Eziongaber," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:35">Numbers 33:35</A> f the King James Version). When the children of Israel left "the way of the Arabah," having come from the Northwest, they seem to have turned to the Northeast from the neighborhood of `Aqaba, passing up by Wady el-Ithm toward the eastern desert (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+2:8">Deuteronomy 2:8</A>). Elath and Ezion-geber were evidently not far apart. They are named together again in connection with the maritime enterprises of Solomon and Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+9:26">1&nbsp;Kings 9:26</A>, etc.). They therefore both lay on the shore of the sea. No trace of Ezion-geber is to be found on the present coast line. It is probable, however, that in ancient times the sea covered a considerable stretch of the mud flats at the South end of Wady el-`Arabah, and the site of Ezion-geber may be sought near the spring `Ain el-Ghudyan, about 15 miles North of the present head of the Gulf of `Aqaba.
