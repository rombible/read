            <P><B>AMRAM</B><P> am'-ram (`amram, "people exalted"):
<P> (1) Father of Aaron, Moses and Miriam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+6:20">Exodus 6:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+26:59">Numbers 26:59</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:3">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+23:13">23:13</A>); and a son of Kohath, the son of Levi (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+6:18">Exodus 6:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:19">Numbers 3:19</A>, etc.). It is not certain that he was literally the son of Kohath, but rather his descendant, since there were ten generations from Joseph to Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:20-27">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:20-27</A>), while only four are actually mentioned from Levi to Moses for the corresponding period. Moreover the Kohathites at the time of the Exodus numbered 8,600 (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+3:28">Numbers 3:28</A>), which would therefore have been an impossibility if only two generations had lived. It seems best to regard Amram as a descendant of Kohath, and his wife Jochebed as a "daughter of Levi" in a general sense.
<P> (2) One of the Bani, who in the days of Ezra had taken a foreign wife (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:34">Ezra 10:34</A>).
<P> (3) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:41">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:41</A> (the King James Version) for the properly read \HAMRAN\ of the Revised Version (British and American) (chamran), a Horite, who in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:26">Genesis 36:26</A> is called \HEMDAN\ (which see).
