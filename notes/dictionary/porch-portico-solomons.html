            <P><B>PORCH, PORTICO, SOLOMON'S</B><P> por'-ti-ko, (he stoa he kaloumene Solomontos):
<P> This important element of Herod's temple, preserving in its name a traditional connection with Solomon, is thrice referred to in the New Testament, namely, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:23">John 10:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</A>, "the porch that is called Solomon's"; and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:12">Acts 5:12</A>. In these passages the Greek word stoa is translated "porch" but in the Revised Version margin of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</A> more correctly "portico". In architecture a "porch" is strictly an exterior structure forming a covered approach to the entrance of a building; a "portico" is an ambulatory, consisting of a roof supported by columns placed at regular intervals--a roofed colonnade. The portico bearing Solomon's name was that running along the eastern wall in the Court of the Gentiles of Herod's temple. It had double columns, while that on the South known as the Royal Portico had four rows (compare Josephus, Ant, XV, xi, 3; BJ, V, v, and see TEMPLE, HEROD'S). The portico was the scene of Christ's teaching at the Feast of the Dedication (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:23">John 10:23</A>), and was flocked to by the multitude after the healing of the lame man (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</A>). There the apostles preached and wrought other miracles (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:12">Acts 5:12</A>).
