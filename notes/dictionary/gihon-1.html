            <P><B>GIHON (1)</B><P> gi'-hon (gichon; Geon):
<P> One of the four rivers of Eden (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:13">Genesis 2:13</A>). It is said to compass the Whole land of Cush (Ethiopia), probably a province East of the Tigris. The Gihon is thought by Sayce to be the Kerkha, coming down from Luristan through the province known in the cuneiform texts as Kassi, probably the Cush of the Bible.
<P> See EDEN.
<P> Used figuratively of wisdom in Sirach 24:27, "as Gihon (the King James Version Geon) in the days of vintage."
