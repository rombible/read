            <P><B>HOSAH</B><P> ho'-sa (chocah):
<P> A city on the border of Asher, in the neighborhood of Tyre (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:29">Joshua 19:29</A>). Septuagint reads Iaseiph, which might suggest identification with Kefr Yasif, to the Northeast of Acre. Possibly, however, as Sayce (HCM, 429) and Moore (Judges, 51) suggest, Hosah may represent the Assyrian Usu. Some scholars think that Usu was the Assyrian name for Palaetyrus. If "the fenced city of Tyre" were that on the island, while the city on the mainland lay at Ras el-`Ain, 30 stadia to the South (Strabo xvi.758), this identification is not improbable.
