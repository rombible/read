<P> Modern scholars unanimously identify this city with Kir of Moab. In Jehoram's invasion of Moab it alone withstood his attack; and on the city wall the king of Moab sacrificed his son (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+3:25">2&nbsp;Kings 3:25</A>). It was obviously the capital, i.e. Kir Moab. The name is generally taken to mean "city of the sun." Cheyne, however, points out (EB, under the word):
<P> (1) that this explanation was unknown to the ancients;
<P> (2) that"kir" is nowhere suposed to mean "city," except in the compound names Kir-heres, Kir-hareseth, and Kir Moab;
<P> (3) that cheres, "sun," nowhere has a feminine ending, and
<P> (4) that <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+16:7">Isaiah 16:7</A> Septuagint and Aquila.) indicates "d" and not "r" in the second part of the name (Deseth). He suggests, therefore, that we should possibly read qiryath chadhdshah, "new city."
