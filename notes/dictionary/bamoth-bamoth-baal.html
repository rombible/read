            <P><B>BAMOTH; BAMOTH-BAAL</B><P> ba'-moth, ba'-moth-ba'-al (bamoth-ba'al, "high places of Baal"):
<P> Bamoth is referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:19,20">Numbers 21:19,20</A>, as a station in the journeyings of Israel North of the Arnon. It is probably the same place as the Bamoth-baal of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+22:41">Numbers 22:41</A> (Revised Version margin), whither Balak, king of Moab, conducted Balaam to view and to curse Israel. Bamoth-baal is named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:17">Joshua 13:17</A> as one of the cities given to Reuben. Mesha, on the Moabite Stone, speaks of having "rebuilt" Beth-bamoth.
