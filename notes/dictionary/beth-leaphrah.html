            <P><B>BETH-LEAPHRAH</B><P> beth-le-af'-ra (beth le`aphrah; Septuagint ex oikou kata gelota, "house of dust"):
<P> The name of a place found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+1:10">Micah 1:10</A>. From the connection in which it is used it was probably in the Philistine plain. There seems to be a play upon the name in the sentence, "at Beth le-`apharah have I rolled myself in the dust," `aphrah meaning "dust," and possibly another on Philistine in rolled, hith-palldshithi (see G. A. Smith, The Book of the Twelve Prophets, called Minor, in the place cited.).
