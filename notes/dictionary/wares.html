<P> (2) mekher, "price" or "pay," value, merchandise (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+13:16">Nehemiah 13:16</A>);
<P> (3) mimkar, a "selling," the thing sold (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+13:20">Nehemiah 13:20</A>);
<P> (4) kin`ah, a "package," hence, wares (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+10:17">Jeremiah 10:17</A>);
<P> (5) ma`aseh, "transaction," activity, property, possession, work, occupation, thing made, deed, business (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:16,18">Ezekiel 27:16,18</A>);

<P> In most cases the real sense is merchandise (see MERCHANDISE). "That which did not a little amuse the Merchandizers (in Vanity-Fair) was, that these Pilgrims set very light by all their Wares; they cared not so much as to look upon them" (Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress).
