            <P><B>SOUTH</B><P> south:
<P> (1) neghebh, according BDB from [?] naghabh, meaning "to be dry," the word most often used, in the Revised Version (British and American) capitalized (South) in those places where it seems to denote a particular region, i.e. to the South of Judah.
<P> (2) yamin, "right hand," "right." The derived meaning, "south," seems to imply an eastern posture in prayer in which the right hand is toward the South; compare Arabic yamin, "right," and yemen, "Yemen," a region in Southwestern Arabia.
<P> (3) teman, from the same root as (2) is often used for the south; also for the south wind (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+78:26">Psalms 78:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+4:16">Song of Solomon 4:16</A>).
<P> (4) yam, literally, "sea" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+107:3">Psalms 107:3</A>).
<P> (5) darom, etymology doubtful (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+33:23">Deuteronomy 33:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:24">Ezekiel 40:24</A>).
<P> (6) midhbar, literally, "desert" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+75:6">Psalms 75:6</A>, reading doubtful).
<P> (7) lips, "south west wind" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:12">Acts 27:12</A>).
<P> (8) mesembria, literally, "mid-day"; "south" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+8:26">Acts 8:26</A>); "noon" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+22:6">Acts 22:6</A>).
<P> (9) notos, "south wind" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:55">Luke 12:55</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:13">Acts 27:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+28:13">28:13</A>); "south" (1 Macc 3:57; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+12:42">Matthew 12:42</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+11:31">Luke 11:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+13:29">13:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+21:13">Revelation 21:13</A>).
<P> The south wind is often referred to:
<P> see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+4:16">Song of Solomon 4:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+37:9">Job 37:9</A> (compare 9:9); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+9:14">Zechariah 9:14</A> (of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+21:1">Isaiah 21:1</A>); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:55">Luke 12:55</A>.
<P> Of the passages where South (neghebh) clearly refers to a particular region between Palestine and Sinai see:
<P> "And Abraham journeyed, going on still toward the South" (neghbah) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+12:9">Genesis 12:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+13:1">13:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:7">Deuteronomy 1:7</A>). We read of "the South of the Jerahmeelites," "the South of the Kenites" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+27:10">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:10</A>); "the South of the Cherethites," "the South of Caleb" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:14">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:14</A>); "the South of Judah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+28:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:18</A>); "Ramoth of the South" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:27">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:27</A>).
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+126:4">Psalms 126:4</A>, "Turn again our captivity, O Yahweh, as the streams in the South," we have a figurative reference to the fact that, after a long period of drought, the dry watercourses are finally filled with rushing streams. The reference in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+20:46">Ezekiel 20:46</A> f to "the forest of the South" is to a condition of things very different from that which exists today, though the region is not incapable of supporting trees if they are only planted and protected.
