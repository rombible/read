            <P><B>WHOLE; WHOLESOME</B><P> hol, hol'-sum:
<P> "Whole," originally "hale" (a word still in poetic use), had at first the meaning now expressed by its derivative "healthy." In this sense "whole" is fairly common (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+5:18">Job 5:18</A>, etc.) in English Versions of the Bible, although much more common in the New Testament than in the Old Testament. From this meaning "healthy," the transition to the modern force. "complete," "perfect," "entire" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+12:6">Exodus 12:6</A>, ere) was not unnatural, and it is in this later sense alone that the adverb "wholly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+6:22">Leviticus 6:22</A>, etc.) is used. "Wholesome," however, is derived from the earlier meaning of "whole." It occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+15:4">Proverbs 15:4</A>, the King James Version, the English Revised Version, "a wholesome tongue" (rapha', "heal," the Revised Version margin "the healing of the tongue," the American Standard Revised Version "a gentle tongue"), and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:3">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:3</A>, the King James Version "wholesome words" (hugiaino, "be healthy," the Revised Version margin "healthful," the Revised Version (British and American) "sound").
