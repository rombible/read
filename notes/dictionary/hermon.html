            <P><B>HERMON</B><P> hur'-mon (chermon; Codex Vaticanus, Haermon):
<P> 1. Description:
<P> The name of the majestic mountain in which the Anti-Lebanon range terminates to the South (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:8">Deuteronomy 3:8</A>, etc.). It reaches a height of 9,200 ft. above the sea, and extends some 16 to 20 miles from North to South. It was called Sirion by the Sidonians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:9">Deuteronomy 3:9</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+29:6">Psalms 29:6</A>), and Senir by the Amorites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:9">Deuteronomy 3:9</A>). It is also identified with Sion (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+4:48">Deuteronomy 4:48</A>). See SIRION; SENIR; SION. Sometimes it is called "Mt. Hermon" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:8">Deuteronomy 3:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+11:17">Joshua 11:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:23">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:23</A>, etc.); at other times simply "Hermon" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+11:3">Joshua 11:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+89:12">Psalms 89:12</A>, etc.).
<P> 2. The Hermons:
<P> Once it is called "Hermons" (chermonim). the King James Version mistakenly renders this "the Hermonites" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+42:6">Psalms 42:6</A>). It must be a reference to the triple summits of the mountain. There are three distinct heads, rising near the middle of the mass, the two higher being toward the East. The eastern declivities are steep and bare; the western slopes are more gradual; and while the upper reaches are barren, the lower are well wooded; and as one descends he passes through fruitful vineyards and orchards, finally entering the rich fields below, in Wady etteim. The Aleppo pine, the oak, and the poplar are plentiful. The wolf and the leopard are still to be found on the mountain; and it is the last resort of the brown, or Syrian, bear. Snow lies long on the summits and shoulders of the mountain; and in some of the deeper hollows, especially to the North, it may be seen through most of the year.
<P> Mt. Hermon is the source of many blessings to the land over which it so proudly lifts its splendid form. Refreshing breezes blow from its cold heights. Its snows are carried to Damascus and to the towns on the seaboard, where, mingled with the sharab, "drink," they mitigate the heat of the Syrian summer. Great reservoirs in the depths of the mountain, fed by the melting snows, find outlet in the magnificent springs at Chasbeiyeh, Tell el-Kady, and Banias, while the dew-clouds of Hermon bring a benediction wherever they are carried (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+133:3">Psalms 133:3</A>).
<P> 3. Sanctuaries:
<P> Hermon marked the northern limit of Joshua's victorious campaigns (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:1">Joshua 12:1</A>, etc.). It was part, of the dominion of Og (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:5">Joshua 12:5</A>), and with the fall of that monarch, it would naturally come under Israelite influence. Its remote and solitary heights must have attracted worshippers from the earliest times; and we cannot doubt that it was a famous sanctuary in far antiquity. Under the highest peak are the ruins of Kacr `Antar, which may have been an ancient sanctuary of Baal. Eusebius, Onomasticon, speaks of a temple on the summit much frequented by the surrounding peoples; and the remains of many temples of the Roman period have been found on the sides and at the base of the mountain. The sacredness of Hermon may be inferred from the allusion in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+89:12">Psalms 89:12</A> (compare Enoch 6:6; and see also BAAL-HERMON).
<P> Some have thought that the scene of the Transfiguration should be sought here; see, however, TRANSFIGURATION, MOUNT OF.
<P> The modern name of Hermon is Jebel eth-thilj, "mount of snow," or Jebel esh-sheikh, "mount of the elder," or "of the chief."
<P> Little Hermon, the name now often applied to the hill between Tabor and Gilboa, possibly the Hill of Moreh, on which is the sanctuary of Neby Dahy, has no Biblical authority, and dates only from the Middle Ages.
