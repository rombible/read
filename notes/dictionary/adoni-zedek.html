            <P><B>ADONI-ZEDEK</B><P> a-do-ni-ze'-dek ('adhonitsedheq, "lord of righteousness"):
<P> King of Jerusalem at the time of the conquest of Canaan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:1">Joshua 10:1</A>). When he heard of the fall of Ai and the submission of the Gibeonites, he entered into a league with four other kings to resist Joshua and Israel, and to punish Gibeon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:3,4">Joshua 10:3,4</A>), but was overthrown by Joshua in a memorable battle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:12-14">Joshua 10:12-14</A>). Adoni-zedek and his four allies were shut up in a cave, while the battle lasted, and afterward were taken out by Joshua's order, put to death and hanged on trees (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:22-27">Joshua 10:22-27</A>). It is noticeable that the name is almost the equivalent of Melchizedek, malkitsedheq, "king of righteousness," who was ruler of Jerusalem in the time of Abraham.
