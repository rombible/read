<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:24">Matthew 23:24</A>, "Ye blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel" The imagery is that of a drinking-vessel full of liquid, from which tiny impurities are carefully removed while immense masses of other impure matter (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:4">Leviticus 11:4</A>) are overlooked (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+7:3">Matthew 7:3</A> f). The first edition of the King James Version read the same as the Revised Version (British and American), but in the later editions a misprint converted "strain out" into "strain at," an error that has never been corrected.
