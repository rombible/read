            <P><B>SUN (2)</B><P> (Figurative):
<P> Poetical conceptions for the sun are frequently found in the Scriptures, though the strictly figurative expressions are not common. Undoubtedly the Jewish festivals, religious as well as agricultural, were determined by the sun's movements, and this fact, together with the poetical nature of the Hebrews and their lack of scientific knowledge, had a tendency. to multiply spiritual and metaphorical expressions concerning the "greater light" of the heavens. Some of these poetical conceptions are very beautiful, such as the sun having a habitation (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+3:11">Habakkuk 3:11</A>), a tabernacle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+19:4">Psalms 19:4</A>) set for him by Yahweh, out of which he comes as a bridegroom from his chamber, rejoicing as a strong man to run a race. The sun is also given as the emblem of constancy (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+72:5,17">Psalms 72:5,17</A>), of beauty (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+6:10">Song of Solomon 6:10</A>), of the law of God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+19:7">Psalms 19:7</A>), of the purity of heavenly beings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+12:1">12:1</A>), and of the presence and person of God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+84:11">Psalms 84:11</A>). The ancient world given to personifying the sun did not refrain from sun-worship, and even the Hebrew in the time of the kings came perilously near this idolatry (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:11">2&nbsp;Kings 23:11</A>).
