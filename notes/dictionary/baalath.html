            <P><B>BAALATH</B><P> ba'-a-lath ba`alath; (A, Baalon):
<P> between Shikkeron (Ekron) and Jabnoel unless, as seems probable, the suggestion of M. Clermont-Ganneau (Rev. Crit, 1897, 902) is correct that for har ( = "mount"), we should read nahar ("river"). In this case the border in question would be the Nahr rubin. Here there is an annual feast held--attended by all classes and famous all over Syria--which appears to be a real survival of "Baal worship."
<P> (1) A town on the border of Da (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:44">Joshua 19:44</A>) associated with Eltekeh and Gibbethon--possibly Bela`in.
<P> (2) ("Mistress-ship"):
<P> A store city of Solomon, mentioned with Beth-horon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+9:18">1&nbsp;Kings 9:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+8:6">2&nbsp;Chronicles 8:6</A>) and possibly the same as (1).
