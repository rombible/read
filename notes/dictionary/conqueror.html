<P> Known only in the compound verb (hupernikomen,
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</A>):
<P> A usual meaning of the preposition in composition is "above all measure"; hence, "more than conquerors," the Revised Version (British and American), the King James Version. The comparison is to the completeness of the victory. Others may place their enemies in subjection; those here mentioned master not only their foes, but themselves. Others destroy their foes and their resources; while those who are "more than conquerors" convert foes into means of still farther promoting the interests for which they struggle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+3:3-">Romans 3:3-</A>). Nor is the victory external and transient, but internal and permanent.
<P> H. E. Jacobs
