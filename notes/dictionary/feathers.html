            <P><B>FEATHERS</B><P> feth'-erz (notsah; Latin penna):
<P> "Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings (the Revised Version (British and American) "pinions") and feathers (the American Standard Revised Version "plumage") unto the ostrich?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:13">Job 39:13</A> the King James Version); "He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust; his truth shall be thy shield and buckler" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+91:4">Psalms 91:4</A> the King James Version). In the Revised Version (British and American) this is again changed to pinions. in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+4:33">Daniel 4:33</A> the word "feathers" is left. The wonderful plumage of birds was noted and prized in those days, just as now. Old ostriches were too tough and rank of flesh for food. They were pursued for their feathers, which were used for the headdressing and shield ornaments of desert princes. No one doubts that the ships of Solomon introduced peacocks because of their wonderful feathers. Those of the eagle were held in superstitious reverence as late as the days of Pliny, who was ten years old at the time of the crucifixion of Christ. Pliny wrote that the eagle was so powerful that if its feathers be laid in a box with those of other birds, the eagle feathers would "devour and consume all the rest."
