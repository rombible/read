<P> These words are full of the abundant grace of God and are rich in comfort to believers. That which makes man, in word, work and character, acceptable to God; and renders It possible for God to accept him, his service and sacrifice, is the fullness of the Divine mercy and grace and forgiveness. He "chose us" and made us, as adopted sons, the heirs of His grace "which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:6&amp;t=kjv">Ephesians 1:6</A>; compare the King James Version).
