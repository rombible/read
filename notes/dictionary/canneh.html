            <P><B>CANNEH</B><P> kan'-e (kanneh; Chanaa):
<P> Mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:23">Ezekiel 27:23</A> in connection with Haran and Eden as one of the places with which Tyre had commercial relations. This is the only reference to the place and the site is unknown. Gesenius and others think it is probably the same as Calneh of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+6:2">Amos 6:2</A> or of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:10">Genesis 10:10</A>, and Calno of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:9">Isaiah 10:9</A>. According to the Targums, Eusebius, and Jerome, this place is identical with Ctesiphon, which was situated on the Tigris. One codex of De Rossi has made this identification in the passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:23">Ezekiel 27:23</A>. Cornill thinks Canneh is the Calneh of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+6:2">Amos 6:2</A>, but Cheyne thinks the name is really non-existent. He says the words rendered "and Canneh and Eden" should rather be "and the sons of Eden."
