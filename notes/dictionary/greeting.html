            <P><B>GREETING</B><P> gret'-ing (sha'-al; chairo, aspasmos, aspazomai):
<P> (1) Sha'-al means "to ask," "to inquire of anyone respecting welfare," hence, "to greet." In the Old Testament the word "greet" occurs only once in the King James Version or the Revised Version (British and American), namely, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+25:5">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:5</A>, "Go to Nabal, and greet him in my name." But it is implied in other places where shalom ("well," "prosperity," "peace"), the common Hebrew greeting, is used; e.g. in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+37:4">Genesis 37:4</A>, it is said of Joseph that "his brethren could not speak peaceably unto him," i.e. could not give him the common friendly greeting of "Peace!" "Peace be to thee!" So, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+43:27">Genesis 43:27</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "He asked them of their welfare" (King James Version margin "peace"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+18:7">Exodus 18:7</A>, "They asked each other of their welfare"(King James Version, margin "peace"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:7">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:7</A>, "how Joab did, and how the people did" (the Revised Version (British and American) "fared," the King James Version margin "of the peace of"); Joab said to Amasa (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+20:9">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:9</A>), the Revised Version (British and American) "Is it well with thee, my brother?" (Hebrew "Art thou in peace, my brother?"); Boaz greeted his reapers with "Yahweh be with you," and they answered, "Yahweh bless thee" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+2:4">Ruth 2:4</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+129:8">Psalms 129:8</A>, "The blessing of Yahweh be upon you; we bless you in the name of Yahweh"). For the king, we have, the King James Version and the English Revised Version God save the king (m "Let the king live," the American Standard Revised Version "(Long) live the king") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+10:24">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:24</A>, etc.); "Let my lord king David live for ever" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+1:31">1&nbsp;Kings 1:31</A>; see also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+2:3">Nehemiah 2:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+2:4">Daniel 2:4</A>, etc.). In Ecclesiasticus 6:5 it is said "a fair-speaking tongue will increase kind greetings," the Revised Version (British and American) "multiply courtesies" (euprosegora).
<P> (2) When Jesus sent forth His disciples to proclaim the kingdom, they were to "salute" the house they came to (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+10:12">Matthew 10:12</A>), saying (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+10:5">Luke 10:5</A>), "Peace (eirene) be to this house!"; if it was not worthy, the blessing should return to themselves. After His resurrection He greeted His disciples saying, "Peace be unto you" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+24:36">Luke 24:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+20:19,21,26">John 20:19,21,26</A>); He left His "peace" with them as His parting blessing (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+14:27">John 14:27</A>)--"not as the world giveth," in a formal way. A frequent form of greeting in the New Testament is chairo ("to rejoice," imperative and infinitive, chaire, chairete, "Joy to thee," "Joy to you," translated "Hail!" and "All hail!" <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:29">27:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+28:9">28:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+15:18">Mark 15:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+19:3">John 19:3</A>), "Rejoice!" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+3:1">Philippians 3:1</A>; the English Revised Version, margin "farewell"). Another word for greeting is aspasmos, "greetings in the markets" (the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:7">Matthew 23:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:38">Mark 12:38</A>, "salutations"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+11:43">Luke 11:43</A>, "greetings," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+20:46">Luke 20:46</A>; also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+1:29,41,44">Luke 1:29,41,44</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:21">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+3:17">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:17</A>; in all these places the Revised Version (British and American) has "salutation").
<P> (3) Of epistolary greetings we have examples in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:17">Ezra 4:17</A>, "Peace" (shelam), etc.; 5:7; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+4:1">Daniel 4:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+6:25">6:25</A>. These are frequent in the Apoc:
<P> 1 Esdras 6:7, "to King Darius greeting" (chairo); 8:9; 1 Macc 10:18, etc.; 2 Macc 1:10, "greeting, health," etc. We have the same form in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+23:26">23:26</A>. In 3<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:14">John 1:14</A> it is, "Peace (be) unto thee. The friends salute thee." Paul opens most of his epistles with the special Christian greeting, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+1:3">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:3</A>, etc.). Also at the close, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:23">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+13:14">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:14</A>, etc.). He directs greetings to be given to various persons, and sends greetings from those who are with him (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:5-23">Romans 16:5-23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:19">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+13:13">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:21">Philippians 4:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</A>, etc.). In those cases the word is aspazomai, and the Revised Version (British and American) translates "salute," etc. (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:1">James 1:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+1:2">1&nbsp;Peter 1:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+5:14">5:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+1:2">2&nbsp;Peter 1:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2jo+1:3,13">2&nbsp;John 1:3,13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:2">Jude 1:2</A>).
