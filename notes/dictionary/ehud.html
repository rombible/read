            <P><B>EHUD</B><P> e'-hud (ehudh, "united," "strong"):
<P> A Benjamite, son of Gera, deliverer of Israel from oppression by Moab (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:15-30">Judges 3:15-30</A>). Gaining access alone to the presence of King Eglon under pretense of a secret errand connected with the payment of Israel's tribute, Ehud, a left-handed man, drew the sword he had concealed upon his right side, and thrust the king through. He locked the doors of the upper chamber after him, made his escape, and with the Israelites overcame Moab at the fords of the Jordan, slaying some 10,000. Ehud's name occurs again in the Benjamite genealogy (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:10">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:10</A>).
