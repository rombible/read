The main object of the writer is evidently to give an account of Davids ancestors; and the book was avowedly composed long after the time of the heroine. See ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/1-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/1-1.html">Ruth 1:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/4-7.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/4-7.html">Ruth 4:7</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/4-17.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/4-17.html">Ruth 4:17</a> ) Its date and author are quite uncertain.
