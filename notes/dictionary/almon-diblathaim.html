            <P><B>ALMON-DIBLATHAIM</B><P> al'-mon-dib-la-tha'-im (`almon dibhlathayim, "Almon of the double cake of figs"):
<P> A station in the wilderness journeyings of the Israelites, located in Moab between Diban-gad and the mountains of Abarim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:46,47">Numbers 33:46,47</A>). It was near the end of the forty years' wanderings. The name was probably given because the location was like two lumps of pressed figs. In both occurrences the word has the accusative ending of direction, and should properly be read: "Almon toward Diblathaim." It was probably the same place as Beth-diblathaim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:22">Jeremiah 48:22</A>, mentioned in the prophet's oracle against Moab.
