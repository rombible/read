(B.C. 1316.) In the headlong rout which followed the defeat of the Canaanites by Barak, at Megiddo on the plain of Esdraelon, Sisera, their general, fled to the tent of the Kenite chieftainess, at Kedesh in Naphtali, four miles northwest of Lake Merom. He accepted Jaels invitation to enter, and she flung a mantle over him as he lay wearily on the floor. When thirst prevented sleep, and he asked for water, she brought him buttermilk in her choicest vessel. At last, with a feeling of perfect security, he feel into a deep sleep. Then it was that Jael took one of the great wooden pins which fastened down the cords of the tent, and with one terrible blow with a mallet dashed it through Siseras temples deep into the earth. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/5-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/5-27.html">Judges 5:27</a> ) She then waited to meet the pursuing Barak, and led him into her tent that she might in his presence claim the glory of the deed! Many have supposed that by this act she fulfilled the saying of Deborah, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/4-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/4-9.html">Judges 4:9</a> ) and hence they have supposed that Jael was actuated by some divine and hidden influence. But the Bible gives no hint of such an inspiration. </FONT></body></html>
