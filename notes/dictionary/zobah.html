            <P><B>ZOBAH</B><P> zo'-ba (tsobhah; Souba):
<P> The name is derived by Halevy from zehobhah as referring to its supplies of "bright yellow" brass; but this word might be more appropriately used to contrast its cornfields with white Lebanon. Zobah was an Aramean kingdom of which we have the first notice in Saul's wars (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:47">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:47</A>).
<P> (1) David's First War.
<P> When David sought to extend his boundary to the Euphrates, he came into contact with its king Hadadezer, and a great battle was fought in which David took many prisoners. Damascus, however, came to the rescue and fresh resistance was made, but a complete rout followed and great spoil fell to the victor, as well as access to the rich copper mines of Tebah and Berothai. Toi, king of Hamath, who had suffered in war with Hadadezer, now sent his son on an embassy with greetings and gifts to David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:3-12">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:3-12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+18:3-12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:3-12</A>). See <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+60">Psalms 60</A>, title.
<P> (2) David's Second War.
<P> During David's Ammonite war, the enemy was strengthened by alliance with Zobah, Maacah and Beth-rehob, and Israel was attacked from both North and South at the same time. The northern confederation was defeated by Joab, but Hadadezer again gathered an army, including levies from beyond the Euphrates. These, under Shobach the captain of the host, were met by David in person at Helam, and a great slaughter ensued, Shobach himself being among the slain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+10:6-19">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:6-19</A>, the King James Version "Zoba"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+19:3-19">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:3-19</A>). Rezon, son of Eliada, now broke away from Hadadezer and, getting possession of Damascus, set up a kingdom hostile to Israel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+11:23-25">1&nbsp;Kings 11:23-25</A>). Solomon seems (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+8:3">2&nbsp;Chronicles 8:3</A>) to have invaded and subdued Hamath-zobah, but the text, especially Septuagint, is obscure.
<P> (3) Geographical Position.
<P> We can now consider the vexed question of the situation and extent of Aram-zobah. (See SYRIA, 4, (10).) In addition to the Old Testament references we have the Assyrian name lists. In these Subiti is placed between Kui and Zemar, and, where it is otherwise referred to, a position is implied between Hamath and Damascus. It would thus lie along the eastern slopes of Anti-Lebanon extending thence to the desert, and in the north it may have at times included Emesa (modern Homs) around which Noldeke would locate it. Damascus was probably a tributary state till seized by Rezon. Winckler would identify it with another Cubiti, a place in the Hauran mentioned by Assurbanipal on the Hassam Cylinder vii, lines 110-12. This latter may be the native place of Igal, one of David's "thirty" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:36">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:36</A>), who is named among eastern Israelites.
<P> The kingdom of Zobah in addition to its mineral wealth must have been rich in vineyards and fruitful fields, and its conquest must have added greatly to the wealth and power of Israel's king.
<P> W. M. Christie
