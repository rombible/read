            <P><B>IPHTAH-EL</B><P> if'-ta-el (yiphtach-'el; the King James Version Jiphtah-el):
<P> The valley of Iphtah-el lay on the North border of Zebulun (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:14,27">Joshua 19:14,27</A>). Northwest of the plain of el-Battauf stands a steep hill, connected only by a low saddle with the hills on the North. The name Tell Jefat suggests the Jotapata of Josephus (BJ, III, vi, i; vii, i, etc.), and the place answers well to his description. It probably corresponds to the ancient Iphtah-el. In that case the valley is most probably that which begins at Tell Jefat, passes round the South of Jebel Kaukab, and, as Wady 'Abellin, opens on the plain of Acre.
