            <P><B>SHIMRON-MERON</B><P> shim'-ron-me'-ron (shimron mer'on; Sumoon .... Mamroth, Codex Alexandrinus Samron .... Phasga .... Maron):
<P> A royal city of the Canaanites, the king of which was slain by Joshua (12:20). Here the name is followed by that of Achshaph, which also follows the name of Shimron in 11:1. This suggests that the two are in reality one, and that Shimron-meron may only be the full name. A royal Canaanite city, Sam-simuruna, is mentioned in the inscriptions of Sen-nacherib, Esar-haddon and Assur-bani-pal, which Schrader (KAT2, 163) would identify with this, and thinks it may now be represented by es-Semeiri-yeh.
<P> See SHIMRON.
