He is called in his prophecy the son of Berechiah and the grandson of Iddo, whereas in the book of Ezra, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/5-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/5-1.html">Ezra 5:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/6-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/6-14.html">6:14</a> ) he is said to have been the son of Iddo. It is natural to suppose as the prophet himself mentions his fathers name, whereas the book of Ezra mentions only Iddo, that Berechiah had died early, and that there was now no intervening link between the grandfather and the grandson. Zechariah, like Jeremiah and Ezekiel before him, was priest as well as prophet. He seems to have entered upon his office while yet young, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/zechariah/2-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/zechariah/2-4.html">Zechariah 2:4</a> ) and must have been born in Babylon whence he returned with the first caravan of exiles under Zerubbabel and Jeshua. It was in the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, that he first publicly discharged his office. In this he acted in concert with Haggai. Both prophets had the same great object before them; both directed all their energies to the building of the second temple. To their influence we find the rebuilding of the temple in a great measure ascribed. If the later Jewish accounts may be trusted, Zechariah, as well as Haggai, was a member of the Great Synagogue. The genuine writings of Zechariah help us but little in our estimate of his character. Some faint traces, however, we may observe in them, of his education in Babylon. He leans avowedly on the authority of the older prophets, and copies their expressions. Jeremiah especially seems to have been his favorite; and hence the Jewish saying that "the spirit of Jeremiah dwelt in Zechariah." But in what may be called the peculiarities of his prophecy, he approaches more nearly to Ezekiel and Daniel. Like them he delights in visions; like them he uses symbols and allegories rather than the bold figures and metaphors which lend so much force and beauty to the writings of the earlier prophets. Generally speaking, Zechariahs style is pure, and remarkably free from Chaldaisms. <LI>Son of Meshelemiah or Shelemiah a Korhite, and keeper of the north gate of the tabernacle of the congregation, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/9-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/9-21.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:21</a> ) (B.C. 1043.) <LI>One of the sons of Jehiel.

After the death of Jehoiada, Zechariah probably succeeded to his office, and in attempting to check the reaction in favor of idolatry which immediately followed he fell a victim to a conspiracy formed against him by the king, and was stoned in the court of the temple. He is probably the same as the "Zacharias son of Barachias" who was slain between the temple and the altar.
