            <P><B>HARA</B><P> ha'-ra (hara'; Septuagint omits):
<P> A place named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:26</A> along with Halah, Habor and the river of Gozan, whither the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh were carried by Tiglath-pileser. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+17:6">2&nbsp;Kings 17:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:11">18:11</A>, Hara is omitted, and in both, "and in the cities of the Medes" is added. Septuagint renders ore Medon, "the mountains of the Medes," which may represent Hebrew hare madhay, "mountains of Media," or, `are madhay, "cities of Media." The text seems to be corrupt. The second word may have fallen out in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:26</A>, hare being changed to hara'.
