            <P><B>KIRIATH-SEPHER</B><P> kir-i-ath-se'-fer (qiryath cepher; translated by many, as if it were Hebrew, as "house of books." Septuagint polis grammaton; the King James Version, Kirjath Sepher; other suggestions have been made:
<P> "border-town" (Moore) or "tolltown" (G.A. Smith): In two parallel passages (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:15">Joshua 15:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:11">Judges 1:11</A>), it is mentioned as identical with DEBIR (which see), which has been frequently identified with edh-Dhaheriyeh. Sayce would place Kiriath-Sepher to the W. of Gath. See P E F S, 1893, 33-35.
