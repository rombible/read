            <P><B>HADRACH</B><P> ha'-drak, had'-rak (chadhrakh):
<P> "The land of Hadrach" is mentioned only once in Scripture (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+9:1">Zechariah 9:1</A>), and there it is grouped with Damascus, Hamath, Tyre and Sidon. It may be safely identified with the "Hatarikka" of the Assyrian inscriptions, against which Assur-dan III made expeditions in his 1st (772 BC), 8th and 18th years. It also appears in inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III. They place it in the North of Lebanon.
