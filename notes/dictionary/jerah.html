            <P><B>JERAH</B><P> je'-ra (yerach):
<P> A son of Joktan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:26">Genesis 10:26</A> parallel <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:20">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:20</A>). No district Jerah has been discovered. However, Yurakh in Yemen and Yarach in Hijaz are places named by the Arabic geographers. The fact that the word in Hebrew means "moon" has led to the following suggestions: the Banu Hilal ("sons of the new moon") in the North of Yemen; Ghubb el-Qamar ("the bay of the moon"), Jebel el-Qamar ("the mountains of the moon") in Eastern Chadramant. But in Southern Arabia worship of the moon has caused the word to bulk largely in place-names.
