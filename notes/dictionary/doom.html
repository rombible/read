            <P><B>DOOM</B><P> doom:
<P> Occurs only once in the King James Version (2 Esdras 7:43), "The day of doom shall be the end of this time" (the Revised Version (British and American) "the day of judgment"); but the Revised Version (British and American) gives it as the rendering of tsephirah, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+7:7,10">Ezekiel 7:7,10</A> (the King James Version "the morning," the Revised Version, margin "the turn" or "the crowning time"; but the meaning is not yet quite certain); and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+4:9">1&nbsp;Corinthians 4:9</A> (epithanatios, "as men doomed to death," the King James Version "appointed (originally "approved") unto death"). Our word "doom" is connected with the word "deem," and signifies either the act of judging or (far more often) the sentence itself or the condition resulting therefrom (compare "Deemster" of Isle of Man and Jersey). Generally, but not always, an unfavorable judgment is implied. Compare Dryden, Coronation of Charles II, i, 127:
 - "Two kingdoms wait your doom, and, as you choose, This must receive a crown, or that must lose."
