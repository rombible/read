            <P><B>MURDER</B><P> 1. Terms:
<P> mur'-der (haragh, "to smite," "destroy," "kill," "slay" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+10:8">Psalms 10:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+9:13">Hosea 9:13</A> AV]), ratsach, "to dash to pieces," "kill," especially with premeditation (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:16">Numbers 35:16</A> and frequently; \3Job 24:14; Ps 94:6; Jer 7:9; Ho 6:9\); phoneus, "criminal homicide," from phoneuo, "to kill," "slay"; phonos, from pheno, has the same meaning; anthropoktonos, "manslayer," "murderer," is used to designate Satan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+8:44">John 8:44</A>) and him that hates his brother (1<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+3:15">John 3:15</A>); a matricide is designated as metraloas (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:9">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</A>); compare adelphokionos, "fratricidal" (The Wisdom of Solomon 10:3). The plural of phonos, "murders," occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+15:19">Matthew 15:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:21">Mark 7:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:21">Galatians 5:21</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+9:21">Revelation 9:21</A>; compare 2 Macc 4:3,18; 12:6):
<P> 2. The Hebrew Law:
<P> The Hebrew law recognized the distinction between willful murder and accidental or justifiable homicide (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:16">Numbers 25:16</A>); but in legal language no verbal distinction is made. Murder was always subject to capital punishment (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+24:17">Leviticus 24:17</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+9:6">Genesis 9:6</A>). Even if the criminal sought the protection of the sanctuary, he was to be arrested before the altar, and to be punished (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:12,14">Exodus 21:12,14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+24:17,21">Leviticus 24:17,21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:16,18,21,31">Numbers 35:16,18,21,31</A>). The Mishna says that a mortal blow intended for another than the victim is punishable with death; but such a provision is not found in the Law. No special mention is made of
<P> (a) child murder;
<P> (b) parricide; or
<P> (c) taking life by poison;
<P> but the intention of the law is clear with reference to all these eases (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:15,17">Exodus 21:15,17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:9">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+15:4">Matthew 15:4</A>). No punishment is mentioned for attempted suicide (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+31:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 31:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+16:18">1&nbsp;Kings 16:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</A>); yet Josephus says (BJ, III, viii, 5) that suicide was held criminal by the Jews (see also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:23">Exodus 21:23</A>). An animal known to be vicious must be confined, and if it caused the death of anyone, the animal was destroyed and the owner held guilty of murder (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+21:29,31">Exodus 21:29,31</A>). The executioner, according to the terms of the Law, was the "revenger of blood"; but the guilt must be previously determined by the Levitical tribunal. Strong protection was given by the requirement that at least two witnesses must concur in any capital question (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+35:19-30">Numbers 35:19-30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+17:6-12">Deuteronomy 17:6-12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+19:12,17">19:12,17</A>). Under the monarchy the duty of executing justice on a murderer seems to have been assumed to some extent by the sovereign, who also had power to grant pardon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:39">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:39</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+14:7,11">14:7,11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+2:34">1&nbsp;Kings 2:34</A>).
