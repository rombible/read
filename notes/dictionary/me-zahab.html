            <P><B>ME-ZAHAB</B><P> mez'-a-hab, me-za'-hab (me zahabh, "waters of gold"; Codex Vaticanus Maizoob, Codex Alexandrinus, Mezoob):
<P> Grandfather of Mehetabel, the wife of Hadar, the last-mentioned "duke" of Edom descended from Esau (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:39">Genesis 36:39</A>). The Jewish commentators made much play with this name. Abarbanel, e.g., says he was "rich and great, so that on this account he was called Mezahab, for the gold was in his house as water." The name, however, may denote a place, in which case it may be identical with Dizahab.
