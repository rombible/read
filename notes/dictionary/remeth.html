            <P><B>REMETH</B><P> re'-meth, rem'-eth (remeth; Codex Vaticanus Rhemmas; Codex Alexandrinus Rhamath):
<P> A place in the territory of Issachar named with En-gannim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:21">Joshua 19:21</A>). It is probably identical with Ramoth of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:73">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:73</A>, and Jarmuth of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:29">Joshua 21:29</A>. It is represented today by the village er-Rameh, situated on a hill which rises abruptly from the green plain about 11 miles Southwest of Jenin (Engannim). While the southern boundary of Issachar was, roughly, the southern edge of the plain of Esdraelon, the possessions of the tribes seem sometimes to have overlapped.
