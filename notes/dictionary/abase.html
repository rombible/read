<P> The English rendition of shaphel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+40:11">Job 40:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+21:26">Ezekiel 21:26</A>), and of its derivative shephal (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+4:37">Daniel 4:37</A>) = "bring down," "debase," "humble"; of `anah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+31:4">Isaiah 31:4</A>) = "abase self," "afflict," "chasten self," "deal harshly with," etc.; and of tapeinoo = "to depress"; figure "to humiliate" (in condition or heart): "abase," "bring low," "humble self" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:12">Philippians 4:12</A>). The word is always employed to indicate what should be done to or by him who nurtures a spirit and exhibits a demeanor contrary to the laudable humility which is a natural fruit of religion. Such a person is warned that the most extravagant audacity will not daunt Yahweh nor abate His vengeance (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+31:4">Isaiah 31:4</A>), and good men are exhorted to employ their powers to bring him low (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+40:11">Job 40:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+21:26">Ezekiel 21:26</A>). If men are not able to curb the arrogant, God is (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+4:37">Daniel 4:37</A>); and He has so constituted the world, that sinful arrogance must fall (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:12&amp;t=kjv">Matthew 23:12</A>;
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+14:11&amp;t=kjv">Luke 14:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+18:14&amp;t=kjv">Luke 18:14</A>).
