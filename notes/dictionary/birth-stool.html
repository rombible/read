            <P><B>BIRTH-STOOL</B><P> burth'-stool:
<P> Found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+1:16">Exodus 1:16</A>, in connection with Hebrew women in Egypt when oppressed by Pharaoh. The Hebrew ('obhnayim) here rendered "birth-stool" is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+18:3">Jeremiah 18:3</A>, and is there rendered "potter's wheel." The word is used in both places in the dual form, which points, no doubt, to the fact that the potter's wheel was composed of two discs, and suggests that the birth-stool was similarly double.
<P> See <a href="stool.html" target="_blank">STOOL</a>.
