            <P><B>BITHIAH</B><P> bi-thi'-a (bithyah; Beththia; Codex Vaticanus, Gelia, "daughter of Yah"):
<P> The daughter of a Pharaoh who married Mered, a descendant of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:18">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:18</A>). Whether this Pharaoh was an Egyptian king, or whether it was in this case a Hebrew name, it is difficult to say. The name Bithiah seems to designate one who had become converted to the worship of Yahweh, and this would favor the first supposition. If, as the Revised Version (British and American) reads, the other wife of Mered is distinguished as "the Jewess" (instead of the King James Version "Jehudijah"), this supposition would receive further support.
