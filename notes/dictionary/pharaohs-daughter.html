            <P><B>PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER</B><P> (bath-par`oh):
<P> The princess who rescued Moses (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:5-10">Exodus 2:5-10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:24">Hebrews 11:24</A>). This is probably a title as well as an appellation, indicating not only one of the daughters of a Pharaoh, but also some very distinguished rank, thought to be most probably that of the heir to the throne by birth; though she was debarred from reigning by reason of sex, she still possessed the right to entail the scepter and crown to her oldest son. Positive identification of the "Pharaoh's daughter" mentioned in the Bible is not possible yet. All attempts toward identification are, of course, guided by the particular theory of the oppressor accepted. If the Pharaoh of the Oppression was Rameses II, as is most likely, then Pharaoh's daughter was probably the daughter of Seti I, an older sister of Rameses II. If, as many think, the Pharaoh of the Oppression was Thothmes III, then Pharaoh's daughter was some unknown princess. Some have thought she was Hatshepsut, the "Queen Elizabeth of Egypt."
