            <P><B>PIECE OF MONEY</B><P> Two words are thus rendered in the King James Version (qesiTah; stater). the Revised Version (British and American) gives only the first this rendering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+42:11">Job 42:11</A>). It is supposed to be from Arabic qassaT, "to divide equally by weight," and hence, something weighed; a piece of silver weighed for money, and perhaps stamped with its weight. The stater is the well-known Greek weight and coin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:27">Matthew 17:27</A> the King James Version, margin, "stater," the Revised Version (British and American) "shekel"). In gold it was equal to about a guinea or five dollars, but in silver only to about 66 cents (in 1915).
