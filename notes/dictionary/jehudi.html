            <P><B>JEHUDI</B><P> je-hu'-di (yehudhi, properly "a Jew"):
<P> An officer of King Jehoiakim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+36:14,21,23">Jeremiah 36:14,21,23</A>). He was sent by the princes to summon Baruch to read the roll containing Jeremiah's prophecies to them; he afterward read them to the king, who destroyed them. His name is noteworthy, as also is that of his grandfather Cushi (i.e. "Ethiopian"), and the two are said to point to a foreign origin.
