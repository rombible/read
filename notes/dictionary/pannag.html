            <P><B>PANNAG</B><P> pan'-ag (pannagh; kasia; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:17">Ezekiel 27:17</A> margin, "Perhaps a kind of confection"):
<P> One of the articles of commerce of Judah and Israel. The kasia of the Septuagint is said to be a shrub similar to the laurel. Nothing is known of the nature of pannag. Cheyne (EB, 3555) thinks the Heb letters have got misplaced and should be gephen, "vine," and he would join to it the debhash, "honey," which follows in the verse, giving a translation "grape honey," the ordinary dibbs of Palestine--an extremely likely article of commerce.
<P> See HONEY.
