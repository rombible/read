            <P><B>PASHHUR, PASHUR</B><P> pash'-hur, pash'-ur (pashchur, "splitter," "cleaver"):
<P> The name of several persons difficult to individuate:
<P> (1) A priest, son of Immer, and "chief governor in the house of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+20:1">Jeremiah 20:1</A>), who persecuted Jeremiah, putting him in "the stocks" hard by the "house of Yahweh" in the "gate of Benjamin" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+20:2">Jeremiah 20:2</A>). When released, Jeremiah pronounced Divine judgment on him and the people. Future captivity and an exile's death are promised to Pashur whose name he changed from its masterful significance to a cowering one. "Terror on every side" (maghor miccabhibh) is to take the place of "stable strength" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+20:3">Jeremiah 20:3</A>).
<P> (2) Son of Melchiah, a prince of Judah, and one of the delegation sent by Zedekiah, the king, to consult Jeremiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+21:1">Jeremiah 21:1</A>). It looks like a larger and later deputation, similarly sent, to which this Pashur belongs, whose record is given in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+38:1-13">Jeremiah 38:1-13</A>. Accompanying them was one, Gedaliah, who was a son of (3).
<P> (3) Another Pashur (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+38:1">Jeremiah 38:1</A>), who may be the person mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:12">Nehemiah 11:12</A>.
<P> (4) A priest, of those who "sealed" Nehemiah's covenant (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:1,3">Nehemiah 10:1,3</A>), who may, however, be the same as (5).
<P> (5) The chief of a priestly family called "sons of Pashur" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:38">Ezra 2:38</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:22">10:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:41">Nehemiah 7:41</A>; 1 Esdras 5:25 ("Phassurus," margin "Pashhur"); 1 Esdras 9:22 ("Phaisur," margin "Pashhur")). Doubtless it is this Pashur, some of whose sons had "strange wives" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:22">Ezra 10:22</A>).
