            <P><B>ANCIENT OF DAYS</B><P> (`attiq yomin, = Aramaic):
<P> On `attiq, see <a href="ancient.html" target="_blank">ANCIENT</a> (4). The expression is used in reference to God in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+7:9,13,22">Daniel 7:9,13,22</A> and is not intended to suggest the existence of God from eternity. It was the venerable appearance of old age that was uppermost in the writer's mind. "What Daniel sees is not the eternal God Himself, but an aged man, in whose dignified and impressive form God reveals Himself (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+1:26">Ezekiel 1:26</A>)" (Keil).
