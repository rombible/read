            <P><B>PAGIEL</B><P> pa'-gi-el, pa'-ji-el, pa-gi'-el (pagh`i'el, "God's intervention"):
<P> Son of Ocran, of the tribe of Asher, among those enrolled by Moses at the numbering of Israel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+1:13">Numbers 1:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+2:27">2:27</A>). When the tabernacle was set up, the heads of the families of Israel "brought their offerings" in rotation, and Pagiel, as prince of his tribe, came on the 11th day (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+7:72">Numbers 7:72</A>). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+7:72-77">Numbers 7:72-77</A> describes his offering. In the journeyings of Israel he was "over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:26">Numbers 10:26</A>), and possibly standard-bearer (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:14,22,25">Numbers 10:14,22,25</A>).
