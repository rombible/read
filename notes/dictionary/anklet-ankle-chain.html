            <P><B>ANKLET; ANKLE-CHAIN</B><P> an'-klet, an'-k'-l-chan:
<P> "Anklets" is rightly found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:18">Isaiah 3:18</A> the Revised Version (British and American), and "ankle-chains" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:50">Numbers 31:50</A> the Revised Version (British and American). A cognate word of essentially the same meaning is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:20">Isaiah 3:20</A>, and is rendered by the King James Version "ornaments of the legs." It was these "anklets" that Isaiah represented the ladies of Jerusalem as "rattling" as they walked (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:16">Isaiah 3:16</A> to end), "making a tinkling with their feet"; and a part of the punishment threatened is, "The Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:16">Isaiah 3:16</A> the King James Version).
