            <P><B>BEGUILE</B><P> be-gil':
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:14">2&nbsp;Peter 2:14</A> the King James Version (compare
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:14">James 1:14</A>) the word deleazo, is translated "beguile," and means particularly to "entice," "catch by bait." Doubtless Peter got this idea from his old business of fishing, baiting the hook to beguile the fish. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+7:11">Romans 7:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:18">16:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+3:18">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:18</A> the word is exapatao, and means "to cheat" or "to thoroughly deceive." The thought is to be so completely deceived as to accept falsehood for the truth, believing it to be the truth. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+2:4,18">Colossians 2:4,18</A> the King James Version;
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:22">James 1:22</A> the word is paralogizomai, and means "to miscalculate," "to be imposed upon." It refers particularly to being beguiled by mere probability.
