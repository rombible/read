            <P><B>RING</B><P> (Anglo-Saxon, Hring, "ring"):
<P> The word renders (the American Standard Revised Version) two Hebrew words (in the King James Version and the English Revised Version three) and two Greek words. Tabba`ath, the principal Hebrew word, is from Tabha`, "sink," either because the ring is something "cast" or molded, or, more probably, since the principal use of the ring was as a seal, because it "sank" into the wax or clay that received the impression. In Exodus, Tabba`ath, "ring," is a detail of furniture or equipment, as the rings of the ark through which the staves were thrust (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+25:12">Exodus 25:12</A>, etc.), rings for curtains, in the high priest's ephod (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+28:28">Exodus 28:28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:21">39:21</A>), etc. Its other use was perhaps the original, to describe the article of personal adornment worn on the finger, apparently in the Old Testament always a signet-ring, and as such an indispensable article of masculine attire. Such a ring Pharaoh gave Joseph as a symbol of authority (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+41:42">Genesis 41:42</A>); and Ahasuerus gave Haman (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+3:10">Esther 3:10</A>); with it the royal missive was sealed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+3:12">Esther 3:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+8:8">8:8</A> twice,10). It was also a feminine ornament in Isaiah's list of the fashionable feminine paraphernalia, "the rings and the nose-jewels" (quite likely rings also) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:21">Isaiah 3:21</A>). Either as ornaments or for their intrinsic value, or both, rings were used as gifts for sacred purposes from both men and women: "brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings" (margin "nose-rings") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+35:22">Exodus 35:22</A>); "bracelets, rings (the American Standard Revised Version "signet-rings"), ear-rings" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:50">Numbers 31:50</A> the King James Version). chotham, "signet," mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:18,25">Genesis 38:18,25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+28:11,21,36">Exodus 28:11,21,36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:6,14,30">Exodus 39:6,14,30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+22:24">Jeremiah 22:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hag+2:23">Haggai 2:23</A>, etc., was probably usually a seal ring, but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38">Genesis 38</A> and elsewhere the seal may have been swung on wire, and suspended by a cord from the neck. It was not only an identification, but served as a stamp for signature. galil, "circle" (compare "Galilee," "Circle" of the Gentiles), rendered "ring" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+1:6">Esther 1:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:14">Song of Solomon 5:14</A>, may rather mean "cylinder" or "rod" of metal. Earring (which see) in the King James Version is from totally different words: nezem, whose etymology is unknown, aghil, "round," or lachash, "amulet"; so the Revised Version (British and American). The "rings" of the wheels in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+1:18">Ezekiel 1:18</A> (the King James Version) are gabh, "curved," and mean "rims" (American Standard Revised Version), "felloes." Egyptians especially wore a great profusion of rings, principally of silver or gold, engraved with scarabaei, or other devices. In the New Testament the ring, daktulios, "finger-ring," is a token of means, position, standing: "put a ring on his hand" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+15:22">Luke 15:22</A>). Perhaps also it included the right to give orders in his father's name. To be chrusodaktulios, "golden-ringed," perhaps with more than one, indicated wealth and social rank: "a man with a gold ring" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+2:2">James 2:2</A>).
