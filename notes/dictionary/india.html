            <P><B>INDIA</B><P> in'-di-a (hoddu:
<P> he Indike): The name occurs in canonical Scripture only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+1:1">Esther 1:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+8:9">8:9</A>, of the country which marked the eastern boundary of the territory of Ahasuerus. The Hebrew word comes from the name of the Indus, Hondu, and denotes, not the peninsula of Hindustan, but the country drained by that great river. This is the meaning also in 1 Esdras 3:2; Additions to Esther 3:2; 16:1. Many have thought that this country is intended by Havilah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:11">Genesis 2:11</A> and that the Indus is the Pishon. The drivers of the elephants (1 Macc 6:37) were doubtless natives of this land. The name in 1 Macc 8:9 is certainly an error. India never formed part of the dominions of Antiochus the Great. It may possibly be a clerical error for "Ionia," as Media is possibly a mistake for Mysia. If the Israelites in early times had no direct relations with India, many characteristic Indian products seem to have found their way into Palestinian markets by way of the Arabian and Syrian trade routes, or by means of the Red Sea fleets (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:11,15">1&nbsp;Kings 10:11,15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:15">Ezekiel 27:15</A>, etc.). Among these may be noted "horns of ivory and ebony," "cassia and calamus," almug (sandalwood), apes and peacocks.
