            <P><B>MANAHATH</B><P> man'-a-hath (manachath; Machanathi):
<P> (1) A place to which certain Benjamites, victims, apparently, of intra-tribal jealousy, were carried captive (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:6">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:6</A>). Of this town the Manahathites were probably natives. It is possibly denoted by Manocho which Septuagint adds to the list of towns in Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:59">Joshua 15:59</A>). This place is named along with Bether (Bittir). The name seems to be preserved in that of Malicha, a large village not far from Bittir, Southwest of Jerusalem. The change of "l" to "n", and vice versa, is not uncommon. The same place may be intended by Menuhah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:43">Judges 20:43</A> the Revised Version margin), where the King James Version reads "with ease," and the Revised Version (British and American) "at their resting-place."
<P> (2) One of the sons of Shobal, the son of Seir the Horite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:23">Genesis 36:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:40">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:40</A>), the "name-father" of one of the ancient tribes in Mt. Seir, afterward subdued and incorporated in Edom.
