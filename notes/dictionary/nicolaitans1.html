             <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"><B>Nicolaitans</B></FONT> <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">(<I>followers of Nicolas</I> ), a sect mentioned in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-6.html">Revelation 2:6</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-15.html">Revelation 2:15</a> ) whose deeds were strongly condemned. They may have been identical with those who held the doctrine of Balaam. They seem to have held that it was lawful to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication, in opposition to the decree of the Church rendered in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-20.html">Acts 15:20</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-29.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-29.html">Acts 15:29</a> ) The teachers of the Church branded them with a name which expressed their true character. The men who did and taught such things were followers of Balaam. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-peter/2-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-peter/2-15.html">2&nbsp;Peter 2:15</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jude/1-11.html">Jude 1:11</a> ) They, like the false prophet of Pethor, united brave words with evil deeds. In a time of persecution, when the eating or not eating of things sacrificed to idols was more than ever a crucial test of faithfulness, they persuaded men more than ever that was a thing indifferent. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-13.html">Revelation 2:13</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-14.html">Revelation 2:14</a> ) This was bad enough, but there was a yet worse evil. Mingling themselves in the orgies of idolatrous feasts, they brought the impurities of those feasts into the meetings of the Christian Church. And all this was done, it must be remembered not simply as an indulgence of appetite: but as a part of a system, supported by a "doctrine," accompanied by the boast of a prophetic illumination, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-peter/2-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-peter/2-1.html">2&nbsp;Peter 2:1</a> ) It confirms the view which has been taken of their character to find that stress is laid in the first instance on the "deeds" of the Nicolaitans. To hate those deeds is a sign of life in a Church that otherwise is weak and faithless. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/2-6.html">Revelation 2:6</a> ) To tolerate them is well nigh to forfeit the glory of having been faithful under persecution.
