            <P><B>GIN</B><P> jin (moqesh, pach):
<P> A noose of hair or wire for snaring wild birds alive. There are over half a dozen traps and net devices indicated by different terms in the Bible. The gin was of horse-hair for small birds and wire for larger ones. It is mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+3:5">Amos 3:5</A>: "Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is set for him? shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?" Job writing in mental and physical discomfort on the ash heap included all methods mentioned in one outburst:
<P> "For he is cast into a net by his own feet.
<P> And he walketh upon the toils.
<P> A gin shall take him by the heel,
<P> And a snare shall lay hold on him,
<P> A noose is hid for him in the ground.
<P> And a trap for him in the way" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+18:8">Job 18:8</A>).
<P> Gene Stratton-Porter
