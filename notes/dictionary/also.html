            <P><B>ALSO</B><P> ol'-so:
<P> In the Greek kai, when it is equivalent to "also" or "even," is always placed before the word or phrase which it is intended to emphasize (e.g. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+12:3">Acts 12:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1jo+4:21">1&nbsp;John 4:21</A>). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</A> should therefore read, "Your heavenly Father will forgive you also"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</A>, "Whom also he named apostles"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</A>, "The mediator of a better covenant also"; and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+4:14">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:14</A>, `If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also (we believe that) those who are fallen asleep in Jesus, God will bring with Him.'
