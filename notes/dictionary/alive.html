            <P><B>ALIVE</B><P> a-liv' (chai, "living"; zao, "to live," anazao, "to live again"):
<P> These Hebrew and Greek originals are the chief terms for life in both Testaments. They cover all life, including soul and spirit, although primarily referring to physical vitality. Striking examples may be cited: "Is your father yet alive?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+43:7">Genesis 43:7</A>); "To whom he also showed himself alive" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</A>). Often used of God: "the living God" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+3:10">Joshua 3:10</A>); also of the resurrection life: "In Christ shall all be made alive" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+15:22">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:22</A>); of the soul's regenerate life: "Reckon .... yourselves .... alive unto God," "as those that are alive from the dead" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+6:11:13">Romans 6:11:13</A> the King James Version). The term is vital with the creative energy of God; the healing, redemptive, resurrection life of Christ; the renewing and recreative power of the Holy Spirit.
