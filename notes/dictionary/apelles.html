            <P><B>APELLES</B><P> a-pel'-ez (Apelles):
<P> A Christian at Rome to whom Paul sends greetings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:10">Romans 16:10</A>). He is described by Paul as "the, approved in Christ," i.e. "that approved Christian" (Denney). In some way unknown to us Apelles had been tested and he had proved faithful (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+1:12">James 1:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+2:15">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</A>). It is a common name. Many commentators refer to Horace (Satires, i.5.100): "Credat Judaeus Apella, non ego."
