            <P><B>URBANUS</B><P> ur-ba'-nus (Ourbanos; the King James Version Urbane):
<P> A common slave name. Gifford says that it is found "as here, in juxtaposition with Ampliatus, in a list of imperial freedmen, on an inscription, 115 AD." He was a member of the Christian community at Rome to whom Paul sent greetings. Paul calls him "our fellow-worker in Christ" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:9">Romans 16:9</A>). "The `our' (as opposed to `my,' <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</A>) seems to suggest that all Christian workers had a common helper in Urbanus" (Denney).
