            <P><B>REHOBOTH BY THE RIVER</B><P> (rehobhoth ha-nahar; Codex Vaticanus Rhooboth (Rhoboth in Chronicles) he para potamon; Codex Alexandrinus Rhoboth):
<P> This city is mentioned only as the residence of Shaul, one of the rulers of Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:37">Genesis 36:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:48">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:48</A>). There is nothing to guide us with certainty as to the situation of the city. Eusebius (Onomasticon) places it in Idumaea (Gebalene), but no trace of a name resembling this has been found in the district. "The river" usually means the Euphrates. If the city could have been so far from Edom, it might be identified with Rahaba on the West of the river, 8 miles South of its confluence with the Khabur. Winckler thinks it might possibly be on the boundary between Palestine and Egypt, "the river" being Wady el-`Arish, "the brook of Egypt" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+5">Numbers 5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:4">Joshua 15:4</A>, etc.).
