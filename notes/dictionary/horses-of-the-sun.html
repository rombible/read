            <P><B>HORSES OF THE SUN</B><P> (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:11">2&nbsp;Kings 23:11</A>):
<P> In connection with the sun-worship practiced by idolatrous kings in the temple at Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:5">2&nbsp;Kings 23:5</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+8:16">Ezekiel 8:16</A>), horses dedicated to the sun, with chariots, had been placed at the entrance of the sacred edifice. These Josiah, in his great reformation, "took away," and burned the chariots with fire. Horses sacred to the sun were common among oriental peoples (Bochart, Heiroz., I, 2, 10).
