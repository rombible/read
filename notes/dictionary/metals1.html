One of the earliest geographical definitions is that which describes the country of Havilah as the land which abounded in <I>gold</I> , and the gold of which was good.

( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/7-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/7-21.html">Joshua 7:21</a> ) The great abundance of gold in early times is indicated by its entering into the composition of all articles of ornament and almost all of domestic use. Among the spoils of the Midianites taken by the Israelites in their bloodless victory when Balaam was slain were earrings and jewels to the amount of 16,750 shekels of gold, ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Numbers+31:48-54" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Numbers+31:48-54&amp;t=niv">Numbers 31:48-54</a> ) equal in value to more than $150,000. Seventeen hundred shekels of gold (worth more than $15,000) in nose jewels (Authorized Version "ear-rings") alone were taken by Gideons army from the slaughtered Midianites. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/8-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/8-26.html">Judges 8:26</a> ) But the amount of treasure accumulated by David from spoils taken in war is so enormous that we are tempted to conclude the numbers exaggerated.

The first commercial transaction of which we possess the details was the purchase of Ephrons field by Abraham for 400 shekels of <I>silver</I> .
