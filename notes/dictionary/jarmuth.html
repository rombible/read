            <P><B>JARMUTH</B><P> jar'-muth (yarmuth:
<P> (1) A city of the Canaanites in the Shephelah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:35">Joshua 15:35</A>) of Judah whose "king," Piram, joined the league of the "five kings" against Joshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:3-5">Joshua 10:3-5</A>), was defeated at Gibeon and slain at Makkedah (10:23). One of the 31 "kings" defeated in Joshua' s campaign (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:11">Joshua 12:11</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:35">Joshua 15:35</A> it is mentioned in conjunction with Adullam, Socoh and Azekah, and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:29">Nehemiah 11:29</A> with Zorah, Zanoah and Adullam. Cheyne (Encyclopedia Biblica) suggests that the "Maroth" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+1:12">Micah 1:12</A> may be a copyist's error for Jarmuth. In Eusebius, Onomasticon (OS2 132 31; 266 38) mention is made of a Iermochos, or Jermucha, 10 Roman miles Northeast of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin), The site of this once important place is Khirbet el Yarmuk, a ruin, with many old walls and cisterns, on the top of a hill 1,465 ft. above sealevel. It is nearly 2 miles Northwest of Belt Nattif, from which it is visible, and 8 1/2 miles, as measured on map, N.N.E. of Belt Jibrin. Compare PEF, III, 128, Sh XVIII.
<P> (2) A city of Issachar belonging to the "children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:29">Joshua 21:29</A>); in the duplicate list in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:73">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:73</A> we have Ramoth, while in the Septuagint version of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:29">Joshua 21:29</A> we have, in different VSS, Rhemmath or Iermoth. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:21">Joshua 19:21</A> "Remeth" occurs (in Hebrew) in the lists of cities of Issachar; in the Septuagint Rhemmas or Rhamath. The name was probably "Remeth" or "Ramoth," but the place has never been identified with any certainty.
