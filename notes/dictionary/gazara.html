            <P><B>GAZARA</B><P> ga-za'-ra (Gazara, Gazera):
<P> A fortress of great strength in Judea, which figures often in the Maccabean wars. To this place Judas pursued Gorgias (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ma+4:15">1&nbsp;Maccabees 4:15</A>). It was fortified by the Greek general Bacchides (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ma+9:52">1&nbsp;Maccabees 9:52</A>; Ant, XIII, i, 3). It was captured by Simon Maccabeus, who turned out the inhabitants and purified the city. He built here a palace for himself, and appointed his son John commander of his army (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ma+13:43">1&nbsp;Maccabees 13:43</A>). A different account of this occurrence is given in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ma+10:32">2&nbsp;Maccabees 10:32</A>, where the capture is attributed to Judas. The narrative here, however, is inspired by antagonism to Simon because he had assumed the high-priesthood.
<P> The fortress is identical with Tell Jezer, the ancient GEZER (which see). It is interesting to note that recent excavations have uncovered the ruins of Simon's palace (PEFS, 1905, 26).
