Perhaps there is no geographical term in the New Testament which is less capable of an exact definition. In fact there was no Roman province of Phrygia till considerably after the first establishment of Christianity in the peninsula of Asia Minor. The word was rather ethnological than political, and denoted in a vague manner the western part of the central region of that peninsula. Accordingly, in two of the three places where it is used it is mentioned in a manner not intended to he precise. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/16-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/16-6.html">Acts 16:6</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-23.html">18:23</a> ) By Phrygia we must understand an extensive district in Asia Minor which contributed portions to several Roman provinces, and varying portions at different times. (All over this district the Jews were probably numerous. The Phrygians were a very ancient people, and were supposed to be among the aborigines of Asia Minor. Several bishops from Phrygia were present at the Councils of Nice, A.D. 325, and of Constantinople, A.D. 381, showing the prevalence of Christianity at that time --ED.) </FONT></body></html>
