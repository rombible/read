            <P><B>CEILED; CEILING</B><P> seld, sel'-ing (the King James Version and the English Revised Version Cieled, Cieling; the Hebrew words for "ceiled" are chippah, caphan, sachiph; for "ceiling," cippun):
<P> Ceiling occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:15">1&nbsp;Kings 6:15</A>. It comes from the root caphan, meaning "to cover." It has its common meaning of the upper surface of a room; there is, however, some doubt of the textual Ceiled is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+3:5">2&nbsp;Chronicles 3:5</A> ((chippah); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+22:14">Jeremiah 22:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hag+1:4">Haggai 1:4</A> (caphan in both); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+41:16">Ezekiel 41:16</A> (sachiph)), the text of the last passage being doubtful. In none of these cases does "ceiled" refer to the upper surface of a room, but to the covering or paneling of the inner walls of a house with cedar or other costly wood. This is in accordance with a common early use of the English word, no longer frequent.
