            <P><B>DELILAH</B><P> de-li'-la (delilah, "dainty one," perhaps; Septuagint Daleida, Dalida):
<P> The woman who betrayed Samson to the Philistines (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+16" target="_blank">Judges 16</A>). She was presumably a Philistine, though that is not expressly stated. She is not spoken of as Samson's wife, though many have understood the account in that way. The Philistines paid her a tremendously high price for her services. The account indicates that for beauty, personal charm, mental ability, self-command, nerve, she was quite a wonderful woman, a woman to be admired for some qualities which she exhibits, even while she is to be utterly disapproved. See <a href="samson.html">SAMSON</a>.
