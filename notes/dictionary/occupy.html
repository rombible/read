            <P><B>OCCUPY</B><P> ok'-u-pi:
<P> Is in the King James Version the translation of 7 different words:
<P> (1) nathan;
<P> (2) cachar;
<P> (3) `arabh;
<P> (4) `asah, either with or without the added word, mela'khah;
<P> (5) anapleroun;
<P> (6) peripatein;
<P> (7) pragmateuein.
<P> In almost every case the meanings of "to occupy" as used in the King James Version in harmony with the common usage of the time have become obsolete.
<P> (1) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:16,19,22">Ezekiel 27:16,19,22</A>, nathan meant "to trade," and the Revised Version (British and American) reads "traded."
<P> (2) From cachar, "to go about," was derived a designation of "merchants" (Revised Version) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:21">Ezekiel 27:21</A>).
<P> (3) `Arabh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:9">Ezekiel 27:9</A>) signifies "to exchange" (the English Revised Version and the American Revised Version margin, but the American Standard Revised Version "deal in").
<P> (4) `asah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+38:24">Exodus 38:24</A>) means simply "to use" (Revised Version), and the same word in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+16:11">Judges 16:11</A>, with mela'khah ("work") added, signifies that work had been done (Revised Version).
<P> (5) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:16">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:16</A>, "occupy," the King James Version rendering of anapleroun, would still be as intelligible to most as the Revised Version (British and American) "fill."
<P> (6) "Occupy" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+13:9">Hebrews 13:9</A>, in the sense of "being taken up with a thing," is the translation (both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American)) of peripatein, literally, "to walk." Finally
<P> (7) pragmateuein (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:13">Luke 19:13</A>) is rendered in the King James Version "occupy" in its obsolete sense of "trade" (Revised Version).
