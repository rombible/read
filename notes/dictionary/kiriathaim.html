            <P><B>KIRIATHAIM</B><P> kir-i-aitha'-im (qiryathaym, "two cities"; the King James Version, Kirjathaim):
<P> (1) A city in the uplands of Moab formerly held by Sihon, and given by Moses to Reuben, who is said to have fortified it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:37">Numbers 32:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:19">Joshua 13:19</A>). It is named along with Elealeh and Nebo in the former passage, and with Sibmah in the latter. It was in the hands of Moab in Mesha's time, and he claims to have fortified it (M S, l.10). For Jeremiah (48:1,23) and Ezekiel (25:9) it is a Moabite town. Eusebius, Onomasticon, identifies it with Coraitha, a Christian village 10 Roman miles West of Madeba. This is the modern Qaraiyat, about 11 miles West of Madeba, and 5 miles East of Macherus. This, however, may represent Kerioth, while the towns with which it is named would lead us to look for Kiriathaim to the North of Wady Zerqa Ma`in. From this city was named Shaveh-kiriathaim, "the plain of Kiriathaim" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:5">Genesis 14:5</A>).
<P> (2) A city in the territory of Naphtali, assigned to the Gershonite Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:76">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:76</A>), corresponding to "Kartan" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:32">Joshua 21:32</A>.
