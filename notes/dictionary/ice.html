            <P><B>ICE</B><P> is (qerach):
<P> Ice is almost unknown in Palestine and Syria except on the highest mountains. At moderate heights of less than 4,000 ft. a little ice may form during the night in winter, but the warm rays of the sun melt it the next day. A great quantity of snow is packed away in caves in the mountains during the winter, and is thus preserved for use in the summer months. The word is found in the Bible in three places where it describes God's power. "Out of whose womb came the ice? And the .... frost" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:29">Job 38:29</A>); "By the breath of God ice is given" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+37:10">Job 37:10</A>); "He casteth forth his ice like morsels" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+147:17">Psalms 147:17</A>).
<P> Figurative:
<P> Untrue friends are compared to streams "which are black by reason of the ice" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+6:16">Job 6:16</A>).
