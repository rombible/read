            <P><B>SYNTYCHE</B><P> sin'-ti-ke (Suntuche, literally, "fortunate" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:2">Philippians 4:2</A>)):
<P> A Christian woman in the church at Philippi; She and Euodia, who had some quarrel or cause of difference between them, are mentioned by name by Paul, and are besought separately: "I beseech Euodia, and I beseech Syntyche" (the King James Version) to be reconciled to one another, to be "of the same mind in the Lord." The apostle also entreats an unnamed Christian at Philippi, whom he terms "true yokefellow," to "help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel." What he means is that he asks the true yokefellow to help Euodia and Syntyche, each of whom had labored with Paul.
<P> This refers to the visit which he, in company with Silas and Luke and Timothy, paid to Philippi (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+16:12">Acts 16:12</A>), and which resulted in the gospel being introduced to that city and the church being formed there. Euodia and Syntyche had been among the first converts and had proved helpful in carrying on the work. The word used for "labored" signifies "they joined with me in my struggle," and probably refers to something more than ordinary labor, for those were critical times of danger and suffering, which the apostle and his companions and fellow-workers then encountered at Philippi.
<P> That workers so enthusiastic and so honored should have quarreled, was very sad. Paul, therefore, entreats them to be reconciled. Doubtless his request was given heed to, especially in view of his promised visit to Philippi.
<P> See EUODIA; YOKE-FELLOW.
