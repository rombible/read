            <P><B>ASHIMA</B><P> a-shi'-ma, ash'-i-ma ('ashima'; Asimath):
<P> A deity worshipped at Hamath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+17:30">2&nbsp;Kings 17:30</A>) of whom nothing further is known. It has been suggested that the name is the same as that of the goddess Simi, the daughter of the supreme god Hadad, who was worshipped at Membij, but there is nothing to support the suggestion.
