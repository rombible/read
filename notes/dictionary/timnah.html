            <P><B>TIMNAH</B><P> tim'-na (timnah, timnathah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:43">Joshua 19:43</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+14:1,2,5">Judges 14:1,2,5</A>), "allotted portion; Codex Vaticanus Thamnatha; also several Greek variations; King James Version has Timnath in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:12,13,14">Genesis 38:12,13,14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+14:1,2,5">Judges 14:1,2,5</A>; and Thimnathah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:43">Joshua 19:43</A>):
<P> (1) A town in the southern part of the hill country of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:57">Joshua 15:57</A>). Tibna proposed by Conder, a ruin 8 miles West of Bethlehem, seems too far N. (PEF, III, 53, Sh XVII). It is possible this may be the "Timnah" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:12,13,14">Genesis 38:12,13,14</A>.
<P> (2) A town on the northern border of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:10">Joshua 15:10</A>), lying between Beth-shemesh and Ekron. It is probably the same Timnah as Judah visited (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:12-14">Genesis 38:12-14</A>), and certainly the scene of Samson's adventures (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+14:1">Judges 14:1</A>); his "father-in-law" is called a "Timnite" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+15:6">Judges 15:6</A>). At this time the place is clearly Philistine (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+14:1">Judges 14:1</A>), though in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:43">Joshua 19:43</A> it is reckoned to Dan. Being on the frontier, it probably changed hands several times. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+28:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:18</A> it was captured from the Philistines by Ahaz, and we learn from Assyrian evidence (Prison Inscription) that Sennacherib captured a Tamna after the battle of Alteka before he besieged Ekron (Schrader, Die Keilinschriften und das Altes Testament, 170). The site is undoubted. It is now a deserted ruin called Tibneh on the southern slopes of the Wady es Surar (Valley of Sorek), about 2 miles West of Beth-shemesh. There is a spring, and there are evident signs of antiquity (PEF, II, 417, 441, Sh XVI).
<P> (3) There was probably a Timna in Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:12,22,40">Genesis 36:12,22,40</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:39,51">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:39,51</A>). Eusebius and Jerome (in Onomasticon) recognized a Thamna in Edom at their time.
<P> (4) The "Thamnatha" of 1 Macc 9:50 (the King James Version) is probably another Timnah, and identical with the Thamna of Josephus (BJ, III, iii, 5; IV, viii, 1). This is probably the Tibneh, 10 miles Northwest of Bethel, an extensive ruin.
