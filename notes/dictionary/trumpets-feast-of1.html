It differed from the ordinary festivals of the new moon in several important particulars. It was one of the seven days of holy convocation. Instead of the mere blowing of the trumpets of the temple at the time of the offering of the sacrifices, it was "a day of blowing of trumpets." In addition to the daily sacrifices and the eleven victims offered on the first of every month, there were offered a young bullock, a ram and seven lambs of the first year, with the accustomed meat offerings, and a kid for a sin offering. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Numbers+29:1-6" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Numbers+29:1-6&amp;t=niv">Numbers 29:1-6</a> ) The regular monthly offering was thus repeated, with the exception of the young bullock. It has been conjectured that ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/81-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/81-1.html">Psalms 81:1</a> ) ... one of the songs of Asaph, was composed expressly for the Feast of Trumpets. The psalm is used in the service for the day by the modern Jews. Various meanings have been assigned to the Feast of Trumpets; but there seems to be no sufficient reason to call in question the common opinion of Jews and Christians, that if was the festival of the New Years day of the civil year, the first of Tisri, the month which commenced the sabbatical year and the year of jubilee. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
