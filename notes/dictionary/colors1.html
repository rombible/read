The <I>purple</I> and the <I>blue</I> were derived from a small shellfish found in the Mediterranean, and were very costly, and hence they were the royal colors. <I>Red</I> , both scarlet and crimson, was derived from an insect resembling the cochineal. The natural colors noticed in the Bible are white, black, red, yellow and green. The only fundamental color of which the Hebrews appear to have had a clear conception was <I>red</I> ; and even this is not very often noticed. </FONT></body></html>
