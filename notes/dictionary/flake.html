            <P><B>FLAKE</B><P> flak (mappal, a word of uncertain meaning):
<P> It is used in the sense of "refuse (husks) of the wheat" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+8:6">Amos 8:6</A>. With regard to the body we find it used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:23">Job 41:23</A> in the description of leviathan (the crocodile):
<P> "The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved." Baethgen in Kautzsch's translation of the Old Testament translates "Wampen," i.e. the collops or lateral folds of flesh and armored skin. A better translation would perhaps be: "the horny epidermic scales" of the body, differentiated from the bony dermal scutes of the back (Hebrew "channels of shields," "courses of scales"), which are mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:15">Job 41:15</A> margin.
<P> H. L. E. Luering
