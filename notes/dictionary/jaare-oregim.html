<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:19">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:19</A>, given as the name of a Bethlehemite, father of Elhanan, who is said to have slain Goliath the Gittite (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17">1&nbsp;Samuel 17</A>). The name is not likely to be a man's name; the second part means "weavers" and occurs also as the last word of the verse in the Massoretic Text, so it is probably a scribal error here due to repetition. The first part is taken to be
<P> (1) an error for ya`ir (see JAIR), which is to be read in the parallel section in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+20:5">1&nbsp;Chronicles 20:5</A>;
<P> (2) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:24">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:24</A> Elhanan is the son of Dodo, also a Bethlehemite, and Klostermann would read here Dodai as the name of Elhanan's father.
