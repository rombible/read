<P> "Forgers of lies" occurs in Job's reply to his comforters (13:4; compare 14:17); the word is the translation of Taphal, "to patch," "lay on," "besmear," hence, to impute, overcharge, etc.; in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+119:69">Psalms 119:69</A>, "forged" occurs with a similar meaning:
<P> "The proud have forged a lie against me" (compare Sirach 51:2). "Forger," in the sense of "one who forges, makes, anything," is the Revised Version (British and American) rendering of laTas "to smite," or "hammer," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+4:22">Genesis 4:22</A> King James Version: "Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron," the Revised Version (British and American) "the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron," margin "an instructor of every artificer of copper and iron."
