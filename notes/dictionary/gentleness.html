            <P><B>GENTLENESS</B><P> jen'-t'-l-nes (`anah; epieikeia, chrestotes):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+22:36">2&nbsp;Samuel 22:36</A> `anah, "to bend low," "to condescend," is translated "gentleness," "Thy gentleness hath made me great," the Revised Version, margin "or condescension"; so also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:35">Psalms 18:35</A>, where the word is `anwah "humility," "gentleness," or "condescension." In the New Testament epieikeia ("fairness," "moderation," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+24:4">Acts 24:4</A> translated "clemency") is in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+10:1">2&nbsp;Corinthians 10:1</A> translated "gentleness," "the meekness and gentleness of Christ" (2 Macc 2:22 "favour," the Revised Version (British and American) "forbearance"); chrestotes, "kindness," "usefulness," is translated "gentleness" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</A> the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) "kindness"; chrestos is the word translated "kind" (to the unthankful and evil, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:35">Luke 6:35</A>), and chrestotes seems to carry in it a similar idea of active kindness.
<P> Gentle occurs in the Old Testament only in the Revised Version (British and American) of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+11:19">Jeremiah 11:19</A>, "I was like a gentle lamb" (kebhes). In the New Testament it is the translation of epios, "mild," "gentle" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+2:7">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+2:24">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:24</A>), and of epieikes, "fitting" "proper," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+3:3">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:3</A> the Revised Version (British and American); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+3:2">Titus 3:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:17">James 3:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:18">1&nbsp;Peter 2:18</A>); also, with article, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:5">Philippians 4:5</A> (the King James Version "moderation," the Revised Version (British and American) "forbearance"). In 2 Macc 15:12 Onias is said (the King James Version) to be "gentle (praos) in condition," the Revised Version (British and American) "in manner."
