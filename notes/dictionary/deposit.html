            <P><B>DEPOSIT</B><P> de-poz'-it (paratheke, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:20" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:12,14">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:12,14</A> the Revised Version, margin, paraphrased in both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) into "that which is committed" (see <a href="commend.html">COMMEND</a>)):
<P> The noun was used in the classical Greek, just as its English equivalents, for "that which is placed with another for safe keeping," a charge committed to another's hands, consisting often of money or property; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:7">Exodus 22:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+6:2">Leviticus 6:2</A>. This practice was common in days when there were no banks.
<P> (1) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:20" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:20</A>; also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:14">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:14</A>, the reference is to a deposit which God makes with man, and for which man is to give a reckoning. The context shows that this deposit is the Christian faith, "the pattern of sound words" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:13">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:13</A>), that which is contrasted with the "oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:20" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:20</A>). "Keep the talent of the Christian faith safe and undiminished" (Vincentius Lirenensis).
<P> (2) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:12">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:12</A>, the deposit is one which man makes with God. The key to the meaning of this expression is found probably in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+31:5">Psalms 31:5</A>:
<P> "Into thy hand I commend my spirit: Thou hast redeemed me," i.e. "All that I am, with all my interests, have been entrusted to Thy safe keeping, and, therefore, I have no anxieties with respect to the future. The day of reckoning, `that day,' will show how faithful are the hands that hold this trust."
<P> H. E. Jacobs
