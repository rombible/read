            <P><B>JOGBEHAH</B><P> jog'-be-ha (yoghbechah):
<P> A city in Gilead assigned to Gad and fortified by that tribe (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:35">Numbers 32:35</A>). It lay on the line along which Gideon chased the Midianites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:11">Judges 8:11</A>), and the indication there leaves no doubt that it is represented today by Ajbeihat. The name attaches to 3 groups of ruins which date from Roman times. The position is about 7 miles Northwest of `Amman, and about midway between that city and the town of es-SalT. It stands 3,468 ft. above the level of the Mediterranean.
