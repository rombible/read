            <P><B>MEREMOTH</B><P> mer'-e-moth, me-re'-moth (meremoth, "heights"; Mereimoth):
<P> (1) Son of Uriah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:33">Ezra 8:33</A>), who was head of the 7th course of priests appointed by David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+24:10">1&nbsp;Chronicles 24:10</A>, Hakkoz = Koz; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:4,21">Nehemiah 3:4,21</A>). The family of Koz were among those unable to prove their pedigree on the return from Babylon, and were therefore deposed as polluted (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:61,62">Ezra 2:61,62</A>). Meremoth's division of the family must, however, have been scatheless, for he is employed in the temple after the return as weigher of the gold and the vessels (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:33">Ezra 8:33</A>), a function reserved for priests alone (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:24-28">Ezra 8:24-28</A>). He takes a double part in the reconstruction under Nehemiah, first as a builder of the wall of the city (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:4">Nehemiah 3:4</A>), then as a restorer of that part of the temple abutting on the house of Eliashib the priest (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:21">Nehemiah 3:21</A>); "Marmoth" in 1 Esdras 8:62.
<P> (2) A member of the house of Bani, and, like so many of that house, among those who married and put away foreign wives (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:36">Ezra 10:36</A>). He seems to be named Carabasion (!) in the corresponding list of 1 Esdras 9:34.
<P> (3) The name occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:5">Nehemiah 10:5</A> among those who "seal the covenant" with Nehemiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:1">Nehemiah 10:1</A>). It may there be the name of an individual (in which case there were 4 of the name), or it may be a family name. Certainly a "Meremoth" came back under Zerubbabel 100 years before (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:3">Nehemiah 12:3</A>), and the signatory in question may be either a descendant of the same name or a family representative. The name recurs later in the same list (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:15">Nehemiah 12:15</A>) as "Meraioth" through a scribal error confusing the two Hebrew letters yodh (y) and cholem (o) for mem (m). A comparison of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:1-3">Nehemiah 12:1-3</A> and 12:12-15 shows clearly that it is the same person. Note that in 12:15 "Helkai" is the name of the contemporary leader.
<P> (4) For Meremoth (1 Esdras 8:2 the King James Version).
