            <P><B>PERSIA</B><P> pur'-sha, (parats; Persia; in Assyrian Parsu, Parsua; in Achemenian Persian Parsa, modern Fars):
<P> In the Bible (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+36:20,22,23">2&nbsp;Chronicles 36:20,22,23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:1,8">Ezra 1:1,8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+1:3,14,18">Esther 1:3,14,18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=es+10:2">10:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:10">Ezekiel 27:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+38:5">38:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+8:20">Daniel 8:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+10:1">10:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+11:2">11:2</A>) this name denotes properly the modern province of Fars, not the whole Persian empire. The latter was by its people called Airyaria, the present Iran (from the Sanskrit word arya, "noble"); and even now the Persians never call their country anything but Iran, never "Persia." The province of Persis lay to the East of Elam (Susiana), and stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Great Salt Desert, having Carmania on the Southeast. Its chief cities were Persepolis and Pasargadae. Along the Persian Gulf the land is low, hot and unhealthy, but it soon begins to rise as one travels inland. Most of the province consists of high and steep mountains and plateaus, with fertile valleys. The table-lands in which lie the modern city of Shiraz and the ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae are well watered and productive. Nearer the desert, however, cultivation grows scanty for want of water. Persia was doubtless in early times included in Elam, and its population was then either Semitic or allied to the Accadians, who founded more than one state in the Babylonian plain. The Aryan Persians seem to have occupied the country in the 8th or 9th century BC.
