            <P><B>BUSH</B><P> boosh:
 (1) (ceneh, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+3:2-4">Exodus 3:2-4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+33:16">Deuteronomy 33:16</A>; batos, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:26">Mark 12:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:44">Luke 6:44</A>, "bramble bush"; 20:37; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+7:30,35">Acts 7:30,35</A>. All the Old Testament references and the New Testament references, except <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+6:44">Luke 6:44</A>, are to the same "bush," namely, Moses' "burning bush"). From its etymology ceneh clearly denotes a "thorny" plant, as does the corresponding batos in the Septuagint and New Testament. In the Latin versions rubus, i.e. "bramble," is used as equivalent. Several varieties of bramble flourish in Palestine, of which the most common is Rubus discolor, but this is not an indigenous plant in Sinai. It is stated by Post that a bush of this plant has been planted by the monks of the Convent of Catherine at Sinai to the rear of the "Chapel of the Burning Bush." In spite of tradition there is but little doubt that Moses' "burning bush" must actually have been a shrub of one of the various thorny acacias, or allied plants, indigenous in the Sinaitic peninsula.
<P> (2) (siach "plant," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:5">Genesis 2:5</A>; "shrub," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+21:15">Genesis 21:15</A>; "bush," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+30:4,7">Job 30:4,7</A>). In the first reference any kind of plant may be meant, but in the other passages the reference is to the low bushes or scrub, such as are found in the desert.
<P> (3) (nahalolim, the King James Version bushes, the Revised Version (British and American) \PASTURE\, margin "bushes,"
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:19">Isaiah 7:19</A>). The meaning appears to be rather a place for watering flocks, the corresponding Arabic root nahal, having the meaning "to quench one's thirst," and the corresponding noun of place, manhal, meaning a watering-place in the desert.
