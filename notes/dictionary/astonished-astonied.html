            <P><B>ASTONISHED; ASTONIED</B><P> as-ton'-isht, as-ton'-id (shamem, "astonished," the root idea being "silent," i.e. struck dumb with amazement; ekplessomai, "to be struck with astonishment," as if by a blow or a shock; existemi, "to amaze," "to throw into wonderment"; thambeomai, "to astonish" to the point of fright):
<P> The state of being surprised, startled, stunned by some exceptional wonder, some overwhelming event or miracle, as e.g. Nebuchadnezzar's amazement at the miracle in the burning fiery furnace (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+3:24">Daniel 3:24</A>) (tewah, "astonished"); of the passer-by at the desolation of Babylon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+50:13">Jeremiah 50:13</A>). The personality, teaching and works of Jesus were so wonderful, Divine, supernatural, as to awaken emotions of surprise and awe never before known in the presence of man.
<P> The people "were astonished out of measure" at His doctrine (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:26">Mark 10:26</A> the King James Version); "astonished with a great astonishment" at His raising the dead (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:42">Mark 5:42</A> the King James Version). The gift of the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles was in like manner a source of astonishment to those Jews who believed through the power of Peter's preaching (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10:45">Acts 10:45</A> the King James Version). The miracle of regeneration today, which renews and transforms debased and fallen men into saints, makes the same impression on an observing world.
