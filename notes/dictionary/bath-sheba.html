            <P><B>BATH-SHEBA</B><P> bath-she'-ba, bath'-she-ba (bath-shebha`, "the seventh daughter," or "the daughter of an oath," also called Bathshua bath- shua`, "the daughter of opulence" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:5" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:5</A>); the Septuagint however reads Bersabee everywhere; compare <a href="bathshua.html" target="_blank">BATHSHUA</a>; HPN, 65, 67, 77, 206 for Bath-sheba, and 67, 69, note 3, for Bathshua):
<P> Bath-sheba was the daughter of Eliam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:3">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:3</A>) or Ammiel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:5" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:5</A>); both names have the same meaning. She was the beautiful wife of Uriah the Hittite, and because of her beauty was forced by David to commit adultery (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:2">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+51">Psalms 51</A>). Her husband Uriah was treacherously killed by the order of David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:6">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:6</A>). After the death of her husband David made her his wife and she lived with him in the palace (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:27">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:27</A>). Four sons sprang from this marriage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+5:14">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:5" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:5</A>), after the first child, the adulterine, had died (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+12:14">2&nbsp;Samuel 12:14</A>). With the help of the prophet Nathan she renders futile the usurpation of Adonijah and craftily secures the throne for her son Solomon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+1:11">1&nbsp;Kings 1:11</A>). Later Adonijah succeeds in deceiving Bath-sheba, but his plan is frustrated by the king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+2:13">1&nbsp;Kings 2:13</A>). According to Jewish tradition, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+31">Proverbs 31</A> is written by Solomon in memory of his mother. In the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+16">Matthew 16</A>) Bath-sheba is mentioned as the former wife of Uriah and the mother of Solomon by David.
