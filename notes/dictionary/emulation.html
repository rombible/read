            <P><B>EMULATION</B><P> em-u-la'-shun (zelos, parazeloo):
<P> Occurs twice in the New Testament, once in a bad sense and once in a good sense.
<P> (1) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</A> the King James Version it is the translation of zelos ("zeal," "earnestness," "enthusiasm") where it is classed among "the works of the flesh" and signifies the stirring up of jealousy or envy in others, because of what we are, or have, or profess. The Greek word is used in this sense in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+3:3">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:14,16">James 3:14,16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+12:20">2&nbsp;Corinthians 12:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</A>; the Revised Version (British and American) translated by "jealousy." It denotes a work of the flesh or lower nature, which Christians often fail sufficiently to guard against; it pleases "the flesh" to excite such a feeling in others.
<P> (2) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:14">Romans 11:14</A> the King James Version "emulation" is the translation of parazeloo ("to make one zealous or jealous"), and is there used in a good sense. "If by any means I may provoke to emulation (the Revised Version (British and American) jealousy) them that are my flesh" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+10:19">Romans 10:19</A>, quoted from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:21">Deuteronomy 32:21</A>). It is well to "provoke to emulation" in this sense, those who are slow or indifferent, by the example of earnestness and zeal on our part. This is not to please "the flesh," but to serve "the Spirit."
