            <P><B>HULDAH</B><P> hul'-da (chuldah, "weasel"; Holda):
<P> A prophetess who lived in Jerusalem during the reign of Josiah. She was the wife of Shallum, keeper of the wardrobe, and resided in the "Mishneh" or second part or quarter of Jerusalem (location unknown). Cheyne says it should read, "She was sitting in the upper part of the gate of the Old City," i.e. in a public central place ready to receive any who wished to inquire of Yahweh. He gives no reason for such a change of text. The standing and reputation of Huldah in the city are attested by the fact that she was consulted when the Book of the Law was discovered. The king, high priest, counselors, etc., appealed to her rather than to Jeremiah, and her word was accepted by all as the word of Yahweh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+22:14-20">2&nbsp;Kings 22:14-20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:22-29">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:22-29</A>).
