( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/6-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/6-2.html">Isaiah 6:2</a> ) They are described as having each of them three pairs of wings, with one of which they covered their faces (a token of humility); with the second they covered their feet (a token of respect); while with the third they flew. They seem to have borne a general resemblance to the human figure. ver. 6. Their occupation was two fold to celebrate the praises of Jehovahs holiness and power, ver. 3 and to act as the medium of communication between heaven and earth. ver. 6. </FONT></body></html>
