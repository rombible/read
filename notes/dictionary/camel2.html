The dromedary is a swifter animal than the baggage-camel, and is used chiefly for riding purposes; it is merely a finer breed than the other. The Arabs call it the <I>heirie</I> . The speed, of the dromedary has been greatly exaggerated, the Arabs asserting that it is swifter than the horse. Eight or nine miles an hour is the utmost it is able to perform; this pace, however, it is able to keep up for hours together. The Arabian camel carries about 500 pounds. "The hump on the camels back is chiefly a store of fat, from which the animal draws as the wants of his system require; and the Arab is careful to see that the hump is in good condition before a long journey. Another interesting adaptation is the thick sole which protects the foot of the camel from the burning sand. The nostrils may be closed by valves against blasts of sand. Most interesting is the provision for drought made by providing the second stomach with great cells in which water is long retained. Sight and smell is exceedingly acute in the camel." --<I>Johnsons Encyc.</I> It is clear from ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/12-16.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/12-16.html">Genesis 12:16</a> ) that camels were early known to the Egyptians. The importance of the camel is shown by ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-64.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-64.html">Genesis 24:64</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/37-25.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/37-25.html">37:25</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/7-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/7-12.html">Judges 7:12</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/27-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/27-9.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:9</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/19-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/19-2.html">1&nbsp;Kings 19:2</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/14-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/14-15.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 14:15</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/job/1-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/job/1-3.html">Job 1:3</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/49-29.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/49-29.html">Jeremiah 49:29</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/49-32.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/49-32.html">Jeremiah 49:32</a> ) and many other texts.
