            <P><B>TIRATHITES</B><P> ti'-rath-its (tir`athim; Codex Vaticanus and Codex Alexandrinus, Argathieim; Lucian, Tharathei:
<P> A family of scribes that dwelt at Jabez (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:55">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:55</A>). The three families mentioned in this verse (Tirathites, Shimathites and Sucathites) are taken by Jerome to be three different classes of religious functionaries--singers, scribes, recorders ("canentes atque resonances et in tabernaculis commorantes"). The Targum takes the same view, save that the "Sucathites" are those "covered" with a spirit of prophecy. Bertheau sees the Tirathites as "gate-keepers" (Aramaic tera` = Heb]  sha`ar). Keil holds the three names to be those of the descendants of unknown men named Tira, Shemei and Sucah. The passage seems too obscure to admit of interpretation.
