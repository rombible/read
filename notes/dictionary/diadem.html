            <P><B>DIADEM</B><P> di'-a-dem:
<P> There are seven Bible references to the diadem, four in the Old Testament and three in the New Testament. The Hebrew words do not mark any clear distinctions.
<P> (1) tsaniph, tsanoph, tsaniphah (all from tsanaph, primarily "to wrap," "dress," "roll") mean a headdress in the nature of a turban or piece of cloth wrapped or twisted about the head. The word is also rendered "hood," "mitre." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+29:14">Job 29:14</A>:
<P> "My justice was as a robe and a diadem" (RVm, "turban"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+62:3">Isaiah 62:3</A>: "a royal diadem in the hand of thy God."
<P> (2) tsephirah, means "a crown," "diadem," i.e. something round about the head; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:5">Isaiah 28:5</A> "a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people."
<P> (3) mitsnepheth, means an official turban or tiara of priest or king, translated also "mitre." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+21:26">Ezekiel 21:26</A>:
<P> "Remove the mitre, and take off the crown."
<P> (4) diadema, the Greek word in the New Testament for "diadem," means "something bound about the head." Found 3 t, all in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</A>:
<P> "a great red dragon .... and upon his heads seven diadems" (the King James Version "crowns"); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+13:1" target="_blank">Revelation 13:1</A>: "a beast .... and on his horns ten diadems"; 19:11,12: "a white horse .... and upon his head are many diadems."
