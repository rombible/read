            <P><B>SHEPHAM</B><P> she'-fam (shepham; Sepphamar):
<P> A place, probably a hill town, on the ideal eastern boundary of Israel, named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:10">Numbers 34:10</A>, but omitted in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:15-18">Ezekiel 47:15-18</A>. It lay between Hazar-enan and Harbel (Massoretic Text: "Hariblah"), which must have been in the neighborhood of Hermon. The word means a "naked" place, and doubtless indicates one of the barer midway ridges of Anti-Lebanon. It was probably the native place of Zabdi the Shiphmite, who was David's chief vine-gardener (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:27">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:27</A>).
