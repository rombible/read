( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/13-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/13-19.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13:19</a> ) It has been conjectured that this Ephrain or Ephron is identical with the Ephraim by which Absaloms sheep-farm of Baal-hazor was situated; with the city called Ephraim near the wilderness in which our Lord lived for some time; and with Ophrah, a city of Benjamin, apparently not far from Bethel. But nothing more than conjecture can be arrived at on these points. </FONT></body></html>
