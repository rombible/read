            <P><B>GEDOR</B><P> ge'-dor (gedhor; Codex Vaticanus, Geddor, Codex Alexandrinus, Gedor):
<P> (1) A town in the mountains of Judah, named with Halhul and Beth-zur (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:58">Joshua 15:58</A>). It seems to be referred to by Eusebius as Gadeira (Onomasticon, under the word), which he identifies with Gaidora (Jerome calls it Gadora), a village in the borders of Jerusalem, near the terebinth. It is probably represented today by Khirbet Jedur, about 7 miles North of Hebron (PEF, III, 313, Sh XXI).
<P> (2) Among the Benjamites who joined David at Ziklag were the sons of Jeroham of Gedor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:7">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:7</A>). No trace of this name is found in the territory of Benjamin. It may be identical with (1).
<P> (3) The Simeonites are said to have gone to the entering in of Gedor in search of pasture for their flocks. They smote and expelled the Meunim, "and dwelt in their stead" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:39">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:39</A>). Here the Septuagint reads Gerar, and this is probably correct.
<P> (4) A family in Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:4">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:4</A>).
<P> (5) An ancestor of Saul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:31">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:31</A>).
<P> W. Ewing
