            <P><B>SUMMER-HOUSE</B><P> (beth ha-qayits):
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+3:15">Amos 3:15</A> notes it as part of the judgment on Israel that Yahweh would smite "the winter-house with the summer-house." It belonged to the luxury of the period that kings and wealthy persons had separate residences for the cold and hot seasons. This is the only mention of "the summer-house," but Eglon's "cool upper room" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:20">Judges 3:20</A>, the King James Version and the English Revised Version "summer parlour," not in this case a separate building) may be compared.
<P> See WINTER-HOUSE.
