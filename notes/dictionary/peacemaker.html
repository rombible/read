<P> Occurs only in the plural (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</A>, "Blessed are the peacemakers (eirenopoioi): for they shall be called sons of God" (who is "the God of peace")). We have also what seems to be a reflection of this saying in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:18">James 3:18</A>, "The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for (the Revised Version margin "by") them that make peace" (tois poiousin eirenen). In classical Greek a "peacemaker" was an ambassador sent to treat of peace. The word in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</A> would, perhaps, be better rendered "peace-workers," implying not merely making peace between those who are at variance, but working peace as that which is the will of the God of peace for men.
