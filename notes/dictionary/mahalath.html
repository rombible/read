            <P><B>MAHALATH</B><P> ma'-ha-lath (machalath):
<P> (1) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+28:9">Genesis 28:9</A> the name of a wife of Esau, daughter of Ishmael, and sister of Nebaioth, called in 36:3, BASEMATH (which see). The Samaritan Pentateuch, however, throughout Genesis 36 retains "Mahalath." On the other hand, in 26:34 Basemath is said to be "the daughter of Elon the Hittite," probably a confusion with Adah, as given in 36:2, or corruption may exist in the lists otherwise.
<P> (2) One of the 18 wives of Rehoboam, a grand-daughter of David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:18">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:18</A>).
<P> (3) The word is found in the titles of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+53">Psalms 53</A> (the Revised Version (British and American) "set to Mahalath") and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+88">Psalms 88</A> (the Revised Version (British and American) "set to Mahalath Leannoth," margin "for singing"). Probably some song or tune is meant, though the word is taken by many to denote a musical instrument. Hengstenberg and others interpret it as indicating the subject of the Psalms.
<P> See PSALMS.
