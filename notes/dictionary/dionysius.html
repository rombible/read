            <P><B>DIONYSIUS</B><P> di-o-nish'-i-us (Dionusios, surnamed "the Areopagite"):
<P> One of the few Athenians converted by Paul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:34" target="_blank">Acts 17:34</A>). We know nothing further about him (see <a href="areopagus.html">AREOPAGUS</a>). According to one account he was the first bishop of the church at Athens; according to another he suffered martyrdom in that city under Domitian. We are even told that he migrated to Rome and was sent to Paris, where he was beheaded on Montmartre (Mount of the Martyr). The patron saint of France is Denys; compare the French "Denys d'Halicarnasse" (Dionysius of Halicarnassus). The mystical writings which were circulated in the Middle Ages and are still extant, are pronounced by the best authorities to be forgeries, and date from a period not earlier than the 5th century.
<P> J. E. Harry
