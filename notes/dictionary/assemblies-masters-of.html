            <P><B>ASSEMBLIES, MASTERS OF</B><P> a-sem'-bliz, (ba`ale 'acuppoth, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+12:11">Ecclesiastes 12:11</A>):
<P> the American Revised Version, margin "collectors of sentences," thus Qimchi, Grotius and others. This has been variously interpreted. Tyler translates "editors of collections." Klienert renders "protectors of the treasure- chambers," 'acuppoth being considered equivalent to the 'acuppim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+26:15,17" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:15,17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:25">Nehemiah 12:25</A> (see <a href="asuppim-house-of-asuppim.html">ASUPPIM</a>). The proverbs are like nails guarding the sacred storehouse, the book closing with this warning against touching the collection (compare  <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+22:18,19">Revelation 22:18,19</A>). Delitzsch translates "like fastened nails which are put together in collections." "As ba`ale berith (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:13">Genesis 14:13</A>) signifies `the confederates,' ba`ale shebhu`ah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+6:18">Nehemiah 6:18</A>) `the sworn,' and the frequently occurring ba`ale ha-`ir `the citizens': so ba`ale 'acuppoth means, the possessors of assemblies and of the assembled themselves, or the possessors of collections and of things collected. Thus ba`ale 'acuppoth will be a designation of the `words of the wise' (as in shalishim, "choice men" = choice proverbs,
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+22:20">Proverbs 22:20</A>, in a certain measure personified), as of those which form or constitute collections and which stand together in order and rank" ("Eccl," English translation, 434).
<P> The Jerusalem Talmud takes 'acuppoth as the Sanhedrin. On the whole it is better to interpret the phrase "persons skilled in collections" of wise sayings, grouped in a compact whole (compare Wright, Eccl, 102).
