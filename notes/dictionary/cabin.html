            <P><B>CABIN</B><P> kab'-in (chanuyyoth, "vaults"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+37:16">Jeremiah 37:16</A> the Revised Version (British and American), "cells"):
<P> In the East the prison often consisted of a pit (compare "dungeon-house" the Revised Version (British and American) and "house of the pit" the Revised Version, margin) with vaulted cells around it for the confinement of prisoners. The word is probably a gloss. The phrase "and into the cells" seems superfluous after "into the dungeonhouse."
