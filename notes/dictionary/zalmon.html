            <P><B>ZALMON</B><P> zal'-mon (tsalmon; Selmon, oros Ermon; the King James Version Salmon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+68:14">Psalms 68:14</A>)):
<P> (1) From the slopes of Mt. Zalmon, Abimelech and his followers gathered the wood with which they burned down "the stronghold of the house of El-berith," which may have been the citadel of Shechem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+9:46">Judges 9:46</A>). The mountain therefore was not far from the city; but no name resembling this has yet been recovered in Mt. Ephraim. It is just possible that in the modern Arabic name of Mt. Ebal, es-Sulemiyeh, there may be an echo of Zalmon. It is precisely to this mountain, especially to the western slopes, that one would expect Abimelech and his people to go for the purpose in view. The name occurs again in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+68:14">Psalms 68:14</A>, a passage of admitted difficulty. Snow in Palestine is mainly associated with Mt. Hermon, where it may be seen nearly all the year round; hence, doubtless the Greek reading "Mt. Hermon" in Judges. But snow is well known among the uplands in winter; and the Psalmist may simply have meant that the kings were scattered like snowflakes in the wind on Mt. Zalmon. We need not therefore look to Bashan or elsewhere for the mountain. The locality is fixed by the narrative in Jgs.
<P> (2) One of David's heroes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:28">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:28</A>).
