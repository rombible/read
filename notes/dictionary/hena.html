            <P><B>HENA</B><P> he'-na (hena`; Ana):
<P> Named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+19:13">2&nbsp;Kings 19:13</A>, as one of the cities destroyed by Sennacherib along with Sepharvaim. It does not appear in a similar connection in 17:24. The text is probably corrupt. No reasonable identification has been proposed. Cheyne (Encyclopaedia Biblica, under the word) says of the phrase "Hena and Ivah" that "underlying this is a witty editorial suggestion that the existence of cities called h-n-` and `-w-h respectively has passed out of mind (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+9:6">Psalms 9:6</A> (7)), for hena` we`iwwah, clearly means `he has driven away and overturned' (so Targum, Symmachus)." He would drop out h-n-`. Hommel (Expositors Times, IX, 330) thinks that here we have divine names; Hena standing for the Arabic star-name al-han`a, and Ivvah for al-`awwa'u.
<P> See IVAH.
