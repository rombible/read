            <P><B>PEDIGREE</B><P> ped'-i-gre (hithyalledh, "to show one's birth"):
<P> The English word "pedigree" occurs only once in the Bible, according to the concordance. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+1:18">Numbers 1:18</A>, it is said: "They declared their pedigrees"; that is, they enrolled or registered themselves according to their family connections. The same idea is expressed frequently, employing a different term in the Hebrew, by the common phrase of Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, "to reckon by genealogy," "to give genealogy," etc. (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:5,9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:5,9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:62">Ezra 2:62</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:64">Nehemiah 7:64</A>). These last passages indicate the importance of the registered pedigree or genealogy, especially of the priests in the post-exilic community, for the absence of the list of their pedigrees, or their genealogical records, was sufficient to cause the exclusion from the priesthood of certain enrolled priests.
