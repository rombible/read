( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/amos/1-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/amos/1-1.html">Amos 1:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/amos/7-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/amos/7-14.html">Amos 7:14</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/amos/7-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/amos/7-15.html">Amos 7:15</a> ) He travelled from Judah into the northern kingdom of Israel or Ephraim, and there exercised his ministry, apparently not for any long time. (His date cannot be later than B.C. 808 for he lived in the reigns of Uzziah king of Judah and Jeroboam king of Israel; but his ministry probably took place at an earlier date, perhaps about the middle of Jeroboams reign Nothing is known of the time or manner of his death.--ED.) </FONT></body></html>
