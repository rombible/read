The incidents of her life may be found in Genesis29-33, 35. The story of Jacob and Rachel has always had a peculiar interest. The beauty of Rachel, Jacobs deep love and long servitude for her, their marriage, and Rachels death on giving birth to Benjamin, with Jacobs grief at her loss, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/48-7.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/48-7.html">Genesis 48:7</a> ) makes a touching tale. Yet from what is related to us concerning her character there does not seem much to claim any high degree of admiration and esteem. She appears to have shared all the duplicity and falsehood of her family. See, for instance, Rachels stealing her fathers images, and the ready dexterity and presence of mind with which she concealed her theft. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/31-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/31-1.html">Genesis 31:1</a> ) ... "Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. (B.C. 1729.) And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave; that is the pillar of Rachels grave unto this day." ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/35-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/35-19.html">Genesis 35:19</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/35-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/35-20.html">Genesis 35:20</a> ) The site of Rachels tomb, "on the way to Bethlehem," "a little way to come to Ephrath," "in the border of Benjamin," never been questioned. It Is about two miles south of Jerusalem and one mile north of Bethlehem. </FONT></body></html>
