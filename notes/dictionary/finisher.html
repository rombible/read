            <P><B>FINISHER</B><P> fin'-ish-er (teleiotes):
<P> This word is applied to Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</A>), and comes from teleioo, "to complete," "to make perfect"; hence, it means finisher in the sense of completing; the King James Version "the author and finisher of our faith," the Revised Version (British and American) "the author (margin "captain") and perfecter of our faith"; but "our" is supplied, and in the connection in which the passage stands--after the examples which have been adduced of the power of faith--most probably the best rendering is "the Leader (or Captain) and Perfecter of the Faith," that is of the faith which has been illustrated by those mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11">Hebrews 11</A>, who are as "a great cloud of witnesses" to the power of faith; but above all "looking to Jesus, our Leader" in whom it was perfected, as is shown in what follows:
<P> "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross," etc. "In His human nature He exhibited Faith in its highest form, from first to last, and placing Himself as it were at the head of the great army of heroes of Faith, He carried Faith, the source of their strength, to its most complete perfection and to its loftiest triumph" (Westcott).
<P> W. L. Walker
