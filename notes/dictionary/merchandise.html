<P> :
<P> There seem to be 4 distinct meanings of the word according to the Revised Version (British and American), namely: (1) The products, i.e. goods or things sold or exchanged, and so merchandise in the present-day usage:
<P> (a) cachar is translated thus in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+31:18">Proverbs 31:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+23:18">Isaiah 23:18</A>;
<P> (b) cachar is translated thus in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+45:14">Isaiah 45:14</A>; these two are from a root meaning "to travel around as a peddler";
<P> (c) rekhullah, translated thus in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+26:12">Ezekiel 26:12</A>, from a root meaning "to travel for trading purposes";
<P> (d) ma`arabh, translated thus in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:9,27,33,34">Ezekiel 27:9,27,33,34</A>, from a root meaning "to intermix, to barter";
<P> (e) markoleth, translated thus in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:24">Ezekiel 27:24</A> (the above 5 Hebrew words are all used to designate the goods or wares which were bartered);
<P> (f) `amar, occurring in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+21:14">Deuteronomy 21:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:7">24:7</A>, translated in the King James Version "make merchandise of," but in the Revised Version (British and American) "deal with as a slave," or the Revised Version margin "deal with as a chattel";
<P> (g) emporia, translated "merchandise" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</A>;
<P> (h) emporion, likewise in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:16">John 2:16</A> (the same Greek word is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:3">2&nbsp;Peter 2:3</A> for the American Standard Revised Version "make merchandise of you");
<P> (i) gomos, "merchandise," margin "cargo."
<P> (2) The process of trade itself, i.e. the business:
<P> rekhullah has in it the root meaning of "itinerant trading", and so in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+28:16">Ezekiel 28:16</A> the correct translation is not "merchandise," as in the King James Version, but "traffic," "abundance of thy traffic," i.e. doing a thriving business: "trade was good."
<P> (3) The place of trading, i.e. emporium, mart, etc.:
<P> cechorah in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:15">Ezekiel 27:15</A> is translated "mart." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:16">John 2:16</A> reference is made to the "house of merchandise."
<P> (4) The profits of trading:
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+3:14">Proverbs 3:14</A>, cachar is translated "gaining." Referring to wisdom, "For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, and the profit thereof than fine gold"; the King James Version "merchandise."
