            <P><B>ARMOR-BEARER</B><P> ar'-mer-bar'-er (nose' keli; Greek uses a phrase, ho airon ta skeue, literally "the one carrying the armor"):
<P> One who carried the large shield and perhaps other weapons for a king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+31:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 31:4</A>), commander-in-chief (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:37">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:37</A>), captain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:7</A>) or champion (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:7</A>). All warriors of distinction had such an attendant. Rather than perish by the hand of a woman, Abimelech called upon his armor-bearer to give him the finishing stroke (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+9:54">Judges 9:54</A>), and when King Saul's armor-bearer refused to do this office for him that he might not become the prisoner of the Philistines, he took a sword himself and fell upon it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+31:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 31:4</A>). David became Saul's armor-bearer for a time, and Jonathan's armor-bearer was a man of resource and courage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:7</A>). The shield-bearer was a figure well known in the chariots of Egypt and Assyria and the Hittites, his business being to protect his fighting companion during the engagement.
<P> T. Nicol.
