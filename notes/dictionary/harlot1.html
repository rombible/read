Paraphr. to have been an innkeeper; but if there were such persons, considering what we know of Canaanitish morals, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/18-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/18-27.html">Leviticus 18:27</a> ) we may conclude that they would, if women, have been of this class. The "harlots" are classed with "publicans," as those who lay under the ban of society, in the New Testament.
