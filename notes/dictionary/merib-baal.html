            <P><B>MERIB-BAAL</B><P> mer-ib-ba'-al (meribhba`al; also meri-bha`al, "Baal contends"):
<P> The spelling varies in a single verse; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:40">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:40</A> contains the name twice: first, in the first form above; second, in the second form. The name is given also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:34">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:34</A>. It is the other name of MEPHIBOSHETH (2) (which see).
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+11:13">Jeremiah 11:13</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+9:10">Hosea 9:10</A> the terms "Baal" and "Bosheth" seem to stand in apposition, the latter form being a slightly contemptuous alternative rendered "shame." This is akin to other like changes, such as Esh-baal for Ish-bosheth, Jerub-besheth for Jerub-baal, etc. The change in the first part of the name could occur through a clerical confusion of the Hebrew aspirate pe (p) and resh (r) in Hebrew.
