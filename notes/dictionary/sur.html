            <P><B>SUR</B><P> sur (Codex Vaticanus Assour, Codex Alexandrinus Sour):
<P> Those that dwelt in Sur are mentioned along with the inhabitants of Sidon, Tyre, Ocina, etc., as dreading the approach of Holofernes and the Assyrian any (Judith 2:28). The names run from North to South, and Sur immediately follows Tyre (modern Sur]), with which, therefore, it can hardly be identified. No probable identification has been suggested.
<P> See also JERUSALEM.
