            <P><B>AMEN</B><P> a-men' (in ritual speech and in singing a-men', a'men) ('amen; amen, = "truly," "verily"):
<P> Is derived from the reflexive form of a verb meaning "to be firm," or "to prop." It occurs twice as a noun in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+65:16">Isaiah 65:16</A>, where we have (the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American)) "God of truth." This rendering implies the pointing 'omen or 'emun i.e. "truth," or "faithfulness," a reading actually suggested by Cheyne and adopted by others. "Amen" is generally used as an adverb of assent or confirmation--fiat, "so let it be." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+28:6">Jeremiah 28:6</A> the prophet endorses with it the words of Hananiah. Amen is employed when an individual or the whole nation confirms a covenant or oath recited in their presence (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+5:22">Numbers 5:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+27:15">Deuteronomy 27:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+5:13">Nehemiah 5:13</A>, etc.). It also occurs at the close of a psalm or book of psalms, or of a prayer.
<P> That "Amen" was appended to the doxology in the early church is evident both from Paul and Rev, and here again it took the form of a response by the hearers. The ritual of the installation of the Lamb (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+5:6-14">Revelation 5:6-14</A>) concludes with the Amen of the four beasts, and the four and twenty elders. It is also spoken after "Yea:
<P> I come quickly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</A>). And that Revelation reflects the practice of the church on earth, and not merely of an ideal, ascended community in heaven, may be concluded from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:16">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:16</A>, whence we gather that the lay brethren were expected to say "Amen" to the address. (See Weizsacker's The Apostolic Age of the Christian Church, English translation, II, 289.)
