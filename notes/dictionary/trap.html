            <P><B>TRAP</B><P> (moqesh; thera, literally, "hunting," used metaphorically in Psalms and Romans as "trap"):
<P> Any of the methods for taking birds; see SNARE; NET; GIN, etc. It is probable that a trap was more particularly a hole in the ground covered with twigs, concealed by leaves and baited with food. Such devices were common in taking the largest animals and may have been used with birds also. Trap is mentioned frequently in connection with snare and in such manner as to indicate that they were different devices: "Know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+23:13">Joshua 23:13</A>). Another such reference will be found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+69:22">Psalms 69:22</A>:
<P> "Let their table before them become a snare;
<P> And when they are in peace, let it become a trap."
<P> This is quoted in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:9">Romans 11:9</A>:
<P> "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
<P> And a stumbling block, and a recompense unto them."
<P> An instance where a trap alone is referred to can be found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+5:26">Jeremiah 5:26</A>:
<P> "They set a trap, they catch men." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+42:22">Isaiah 42:22</A> uses this expression, "snared in holes." This might mean that a snare was placed in a hole, or that the hole was the snare to lure bird or animal to its death. The former proposition is sustained by Job, who says, "A noose is hid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way" (18:10). This translation appears as if it were reversed and should read, "A trap is hid for him in the ground and a noose in the way."
