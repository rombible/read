            <P><B>TWILIGHT</B><P> twi'-lit (nesheph):
<P> The twilight of Palestine is of short duration, owing to the low latitude, there being scarcely more than an hour between sunset and complete darkness. It is a distinct boundary between daytime and the darkness. The people of Palestine still give the time of an event as so many hours before or after sunrise or sunset: "David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:17">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:17</A>), and "They rose up in the twilight to go" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+7:5">2&nbsp;Kings 7:5</A>). The word is evidenly used in the sense of darkness in "the stars of twilight" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+3:9">Job 3:9</A>) and "The adulterer waiteth for the twilight" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+24:15">Job 24:15</A>). the King James Version has "twilight" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+12:6">Ezekiel 12:6</A>, but the Revised Version (British and American) has "dark."
