[See <B><a href="ebal-mount.html" target="_blank" url="ebal-mount.html">EBAL</a></B>] According to the traditions of the Samaritans it was here that Abraham sacrificed Isaac, that Melchizedek met the patriarch, that Jacob built an altar, and at its base dug a well, the ruins of which are still seen. Some scholars think there is ground for the first belief (so Smith); but careful observers of the locality discredit it and believe Moriah to be the spot. [See <B><a href="moriah.html" target="_blank" url="moriah.html">MORIAH</a></B>] Gerizim was the site of the Samaritan temple, which was built there after the captivity, in rivalry with the temple at Jerusalem. [See <B><a href="samaritans.html" target="_blank" url="samaritans.html">SAMARITANS</a></B>] Gerizim is still to the Samaritans what Jerusalem is to the Jews and Mecca to the Mohammedans. </FONT></body></html>
