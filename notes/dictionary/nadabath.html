            <P><B>NADABATH</B><P> na'-da-bath (Nadabath; the King James Version Nadabatha, na-dab'-a-tha):
<P> A city East of the Jordan from which the wedding party of Jambri were coming when Jonathan and Simon attacked them and slew very many, designing to avenge the murder of their brother John (1 Macc 9:37). Nebo and Nabathaea have been suggested as identical with Nadabath. Clermont-Ganneau would read rhabatha, and identify it with Rabbath-ammon. There is no certainty.
