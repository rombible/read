            <P><B>BETHULIA</B><P> be-thu'-li-a (Baithouloua):
<P> A town named only in the Book of Judith (4:6; 6:10; 7:1; 8:3; 10:6; 12:7; 15:3,6; 16:21). From these references we gather that it stood beside a valley, on a rock, at the foot of which was a spring, not far from Jenin; and that it guarded the passes by which an army might march to the South. The site most fully meeting these conditions is that of Sanur. The rock on the summit of which it stands rises sheer from the edge of Merj el-Ghariq, on the main highway, some 7 miles South of Jenin. Other identifications are suggested: Conder favoring Mithiliyeh, a little farther north; while the writer of the article "Bethulia" in Encyclopedia Biblica argues for identification with Jerusalem.
