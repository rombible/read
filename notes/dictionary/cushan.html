            <P><B>CUSHAN</B><P> kushan:
<P> In the psalm of Habakkuk (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+3:7">Habakkuk 3:7</A>) "the tents of Cushan" are mentioned in an individualizing description of the effects of a theophany. Parallel is the phrase "the curtains of the land of Midian." Septuagint renders Cushan, kushan, by Aithiopon, reading perhaps kushim, or kushin (kushin). The context indicates that the same land or people is intended as the Old Testament elsewhere calls Cush, yet vaguely and not in any strict geographical usage that would limit it to Africa.
