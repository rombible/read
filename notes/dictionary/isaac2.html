(B.C. 1897.) In his infancy he became the object of Ishmaels jealousy; and in his youth the victim, in intention, of Abrahams great sacrificial act of faith. When forty years old he married Rebekah his cousin, by whom, when he was sixty, he had two sons, Esau and Jacob. Driven by famine to Gerar, he acquired great wealth by his flocks but was repeatedly dispossessed by the Philistines of the wells which he sunk at convenient stations. After the deceit by which Jacob acquired his fathers blessing Isaac sent his son to seek a wife in Padan-aram; and all that we know of him during the last forty-three years of his life in that he saw that <B><a href="god.html" target="_blank" url="god.html">GOD</a></B>, with a large and prosperous family, return to him at Hebron. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/36-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/36-27.html">Genesis 36:27</a> ) before he died there, at the age of 180 years. He was buried by his two sons in the cave of Machpelah. In the New Testament reference is made to the offering of Isaac ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/11-17.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/11-17.html">Hebrews 11:17</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/james/2-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/james/2-21.html">James 2:21</a> ) and to his blessing his sons. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/11-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/11-20.html">Hebrews 11:20</a> ) In ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Galatians+4:28-31" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Galatians+4:28-31&amp;t=niv">Galatians 4:28-31</a> ) he is contrasted with Ishmael. In reference to the offering up of Isaac by Abraham, the primary doctrine taught are those of sacrifice and substitution, as the means appointed by God for taking away sin; and, as co-ordinate with these, the need of the obedience of faith, on the part of man, to receive the benefit. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/11-17.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/11-17.html">Hebrews 11:17</a> ) The animal which God provided and Abraham offered was in the whole history of sacrifice the recognized type of "the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world." Isaac is the type of humanity itself, devoted to death for sin. </FONT></body></html>
