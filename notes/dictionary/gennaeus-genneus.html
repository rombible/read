            <P><B>GENNAEUS; GENNEUS</B><P> ge-ne'-us, ge-ne'-us (Gennaios):
<P> Father of Apollonius, one of the Syrian generals who troubled the Jews while Lysias was governor for Antiochus Eupator (2 Macc 12:2). The description is added to distinguish the Apollonius here mentioned from several others of the same name. See <a href="apollonius.html" target="_blank">APOLLONIUS</a>. There is no need with Luther to take the name simply as an adjective "des edlen Apollonius." The name occurs elsewhere as a proper name.
