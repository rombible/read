            <P><B>ALLURE</B><P> a-lur' (pathah, "to persuade," "woo," "entice"; deleazo, "to entrap," "lay a bait"):
<P> (1) "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+2:14">Hosea 2:14</A>), with evident reference to the Assyrian invasion and the devastation of the land, followed up by the Exile. Thus would Yahweh entice Israel to repent by gentle punishment; then would follow her restoration and the outpouring of His love (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+2:14">Hosea 2:14</A>).
<P> (2) "They allure through the lusts of the flesh" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:18">2&nbsp;Peter 2:18</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "entice"). Wicked men allure to destruction; God (as above) allures to punishment, repentance and restoration.
<P> M. O. Evans
