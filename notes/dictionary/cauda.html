            <P><B>CAUDA</B><P> ko'-da (Kauda; also called Klauda; the King James Version Clauda; the modern Greek name Gaudho supports the form Cauda):
<P> An island 23 miles West of Cape Matala. It is a small island, and can never have supported a large population, or have been of any importance. Its elevation to the rank of a bishopric in Byzantine times must have been due to its association with the voyage of Paul. The ship with Paul on board was driven under the lee of Cauda (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:16">Acts 27:16</A>); in the calm water south of the island the crew succeeded in hauling in the boat, undergirding the ship and slackening sail.
<P> W. M. Calder
