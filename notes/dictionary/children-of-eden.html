            <P><B>CHILDREN OF EDEN</B><P> e'-d'-n (bene `edhen):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+19:12">2&nbsp;Kings 19:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+37:12">Isaiah 37:12</A> "the children of Eden that were in Telassar" are mentioned in connection with "Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph" as having been destroyed by the Assyrians who were before the time of Sennacherib. The expression, "the children of Eden that were in Telassar," undoubtedly referred to a tribe which inhabited a region of which Telassar was the center. Telassar means "the hill of Asshur" and, according to Schrader, it was a name that might have been given to any place where a temple had been built to Asshur. Inasmuch as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph were in Mesopotamia it would seem probable that "the children of Eden that were in Telassar" belonged to the same locality. The "children of Eden" is quite probably to be identified with the Bit `Adini of the inscriptions and this referred to a district on the middle Euphrates. According to the inscriptions Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and Bit `Adini were destroyed by Sennacherib's forefathers, and this is in accord with the account in 2 Kings and Isaiah.
<P> The "Eden" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:23">Ezekiel 27:23</A> is usually taken as the name of a place in Mesopotamia with which Tyre had commercial relations, and probably belongs to the region of "the chilrden of Eden," discussed above.
<P> Some writers think the "Beth-eden" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+1:5">Amos 1:5</A> the Revised Version, margin (the American Standard Revised Version "Aven") is to be identified with the Bit `Adini of the inscriptions and hence, with "the children of Eden," but this is doubtful. This was perhaps in Syria in the neighborhood of Damascus.
