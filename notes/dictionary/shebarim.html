<P> After the repulse of the first attack on their city the men of Ai chased the Israelites "even unto Shebarim" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+7:5">Joshua 7:5</A>). the Revised Version margin reads "the quarries"; so Keil, Steuernagel, etc. Septuagint reads "until they were broken," i.e. until the rout was complete. The direction of the flight was of course from Ai toward Gilgal in the Jordan valley. No trace of such name has yet been found.
