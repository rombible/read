            <P><B>THEUDAS</B><P> thu'-das (Theudas, a contraction of Theodorus, "the gift of God"):
<P> Theudas is referred to by Gamaliel in his speech before the Sanhedrin, when he advised them as to the position they should adopt in regard to the apostles (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:36">Acts 5:36</A>). The failure of the rebellion of Theudas was quoted by Gamaliel on this occasion as typical of the natural end of such movements as were inspired "not of God, but of men." A rising under one Theudas is also described by Josephus (Ant., XX, v, 1), but this occurred at a later date (according to Josephus about 44 or 45 AD) than the speech of Gamaliel (before 37 AD). Of theories put forward in explanation of the apparent anachronism in Gameliels speech, the two most in favor are
<P> (1) that as there were many insurrections during the period in question, the two writers refer to different Theudases;
<P> (2) that the reference to Theudas in the narrative of Ac was inserted by a later reviser, whose historical knowledge was inaccurate (Weiss; compare also Knowling, The Expositor's Greek Testament, II, 157-59).
