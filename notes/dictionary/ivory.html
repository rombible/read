            <P><B>IVORY</B><P> i'-vo-ri (1) shen, "tooth" (translated "ivory," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:18">1&nbsp;Kings 10:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+22:39">22:39</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:17">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+45:8">Psalms 45:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:14">Song of Solomon 5:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+7:4">7:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:6,15">Ezekiel 27:6,15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+3:15">Amos 3:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+6:4">6:4</A>);
<P> (2) shenhabbim; Septuagint odontes elephdntinoi, "elephants' teeth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:22">1&nbsp;Kings 10:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:21">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:21</A>);
<P> (3) elephantinos, "of ivory" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+18:12">Revelation 18:12</A>)):
<P> Shen occurs often, meaning "tooth" of man or beast. In the passages cited it is translated in English Versions of the Bible "ivory" (of "crag," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+14:4,5">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:4,5</A>; "cliff," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:28">Job 39:28</A> twice; "flesh-hook of three teeth," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+2:13">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:13</A>). Shenhabbim is thought to be a contracted form of shen ha-'ibbim, i.e. ha, the article, and 'ibbim, plural of 'ibbah or 'ibba'; compare Egyptian ab, ebu, "elephant," and compare Latin ebur, "ivory" (see Liddell and Scott, under the word elephas). On the other hand, it may be a question whether -bim is not a singular form connected with the Arabic fil, "elephant." If the word for "elephant" is not contained in shenhabbim, it occurs nowhere in the Hebrew Bible.
<P> Ivory was probably obtained, as now, mainly from the African elephant. It was rare and expensive. It is mentioned in connection with the magnificence of Solomon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:18,22">1&nbsp;Kings 10:18,22</A>), being brought by the ships of Tarshish (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:17,21">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:17,21</A>). An "ivory house" of Ahab is mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+22:39">1&nbsp;Kings 22:39</A>. It is mentioned among the luxuries of Israel in the denunciations of Amos (3:15; 6:4). It occurs in the figurative language of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+45:8">Psalms 45:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:14">Song of Solomon 5:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+7:4">7:4</A>. It is used for ornamentation of the ships of the Tyrians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:6">Ezekiel 27:6</A>), who obtain it with ebony through the men of Dedan (27:15). It is among the merchandise of Babylon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+18:12">Revelation 18:12</A>).
<P> We do not learn of the use of elephants in war until a few centuries before the Christian era. In 1 Macc 8:6, there is a reference to the defeat of Antiochus the Great, "having an hundred and twenty elephants," by Scipio Africanus in 190 BC. 1 Macc 1:17 speaks of the invasion of Egypt by Antiochus Epiphanes with an army in which there were elephants. 1 Macc 6:28-47 has a detailed account of a battle between Antiochus Eupator and Judas Maccabeus at Bethsura (Beth-zur). There were 32 elephants. Upon the "beasts" theria) there were "strong towers of wood"; "There were also upon every one two and thirty strong men, that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled him."
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+40:15">Job 40:15</A>, the King James Version margin has for "behemoth," "the elephant, as some think."
