It was a plain country, where brick had to be used for stone and slime for mortar. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/11-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/11-3.html">Genesis 11:3</a> ) Among the cities were Babel (Babylon), Erech or Orech (Orchoe), Calneh or Calno (probably <I>Niffer</I> ), and Accad, the site of which is unknown. It may be suspected that Shinar was the name by which the Hebrews originally knew the lower Mesopotamian country where they so long dwelt, and which Abraham brought with him from "Ur of the Chaldees." </FONT></body></html>
