            <P><B>CLOSET</B><P> kloz'-et:
<P> Is the rendering in the King James Version of
<P> (1) chuppah, and
<P> (2) tameion, also tamieion.
<P> Chuppah, derived from chaphah, "to cover," was probably originally the name of the tent specially set apart for the bride, and later (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joe+2:16">Joel 2:16</A>) used for the bride's chamber. The word tameion, originally storeroom (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:24">Luke 12:24</A>, the King James Version "storehouse"; the Revised Version (British and American) "storechamber"), but since for safety it was the inner rooms of the Hebrew house which were used for storage purposes, the word came to mean inner room, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:6">Matthew 6:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:3">Luke 12:3</A>, in both the King James Version "closet" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+24:26">Matthew 24:26</A>, the King James Version "secret chamber"). In all cases the Revised Version (British and American) uses "inner chamber."
