            <P><B>SHAALBIM</B><P> sha-al'-bim (sha`albim; Codex Vaticanus Bethalamei; Codex Alexandrinus Salabeim, in Joshua, Codex Vaticanus and Codex Alexandrinus Thalabeim):
<P> When the Amorites had forced the children of Da into the mountain they came and dwelt in Mt. Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, where, it appears, they were made tributary to the house of Joseph (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:35">Judges 1:35</A>). In the time of Solomon it was included in the administrative district presided over by Ben-deker, along with Makaz, Beth-shemesh and Elon-beth-hanan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:9">1&nbsp;Kings 4:9</A>). Beth-shemesh is the same as Ir-shemesh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:42">Joshua 19:42</A>). Shaalbim is probably only another name of Shaalabbin. One of David's mighty men is called Eliahba the Shaalbonite. This presumes the existence of a town called Shaalbon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:32">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:32</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:33">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:33</A>), which again is probably identical with Shaalbim. Eusebius (in Onomasticon) identifies it with Salaba, a large village in the district of Sebaste (Samaria), which apparently Eusebius and Jerome thought to be in the territory of Dan. It seems, however, too far to the North. Jerome in his commentary on <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+48">Ezekiel 48</A> speaks of the towers of Aijalon and Selebi and Emmaus. Conder would identify Selebi with Selbit, 3 miles Northwest of Aijalon (Yalo), and 8 miles North of Bethshemesh. This would suit for Shaalbim, as far as position is concerned; but it is difficult to account for the heavy "T" (Hebrew letter Tet) in the name, if derived from Shaalbim.
