            <P><B>TRANSGRESSION</B><P> trans-gresh'-un:
<P> From "transgress," to pass over or beyond; to overpass, as any rule prescribed as the limit of duty; to break or violate, as a law, civil or moral; the act of transgressing; the violation of a law or known principle of rectitude; breach of command; offense; crime; sin. In the Old Testament pesha`, occurs 80 times, rendered in all versions by "transgression." Its meaning is "rebellion". The word "rebellion" differs from this word in that it may be in the heart, though no opportunity should be granted for its manifestation: "An evil man seeketh only rebellion" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+17:11">Proverbs 17:11</A>). Here the wise man contemplates an evil heart, looking for an excuse or opportunity to rebel.
<P> The New Testament uses parabasis, "trespass":
<P> "The law .... was added because of transgressions" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</A>); "Where there is no law, neither is there transgression" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</A>); "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</A>).
