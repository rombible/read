<P> Occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+10:10">Job 10:10</A>, "Hast thou not .... curdled me like cheese?" i.e. made him take solid form. "The formation of the embryo is a mystery on which the Hebrew dwells with a deep and reverential awe: compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+139:13-16">Psalms 139:13-16</A>." These similes are often met with in the Koran and oriental poetry. See Speaker's Commentary in the place cited
