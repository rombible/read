It was the residence of a dynasty of Greek princes founded after the time of Alexander the Great, and usually called the Attalic dynasty, from its founder, Attalus. The sumptuousness of the Attalic princes hall raised Pergamos to the rank of the first city in Asia as regards splendor. The city was noted for its vast, library, containing 200,000 volumes. Here were splendid temples of Zeus or Jupiter, Athene, Apollo and AEsculapius. One of "the seven churches of Asia" was in Pergamos. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/1-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/1-11.html">Revelation 1:11</a> ;  <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Revelation+2:12-17" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+2:12-17&amp;t=niv">2:12-17</a> ) It is called "Satans seat" by John, which some suppose to refer to the worship of AEsculapius, from the <I>serpent</I> being his characteristic emblem. Others refer it to the persecutions of Christians, which was work of Satan. The modern name of the city is <I>Bergama</I> . </FONT></body></html>
