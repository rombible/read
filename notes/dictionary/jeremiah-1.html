            <P><B>JEREMIAH (1)</B><P> jer-e-mi'-a
<P> (a) yirmeyahu, or
<P> (b) shorter form, yirmeyah, both differently explained as "Yah establishes (so Giesebrecht), whom Yahweh casts," i.e. possibly, as Gesenius suggests, "appoints" (A. B. Davidson in HDB, II, 569a), and "Yahweh looseneth" (the womb); see BDB:
<P> The form (b) is used of Jeremiah the prophet only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+27:1">Jeremiah 27:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+28:5,6,10,11,12">28:5,6,10,11,12</A> b,15; 29:1; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+1:1">Ezra 1:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+9:2">Daniel 9:2</A>, while the other is found 116 times in Jeremiah alone. In 1 Esdras 1:28,32,47,57; 2 Esdras 2:18, English Versions of the Bible has "Jeremy," so the King James Version in 2 Macc 2:1,5,7; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+2:17">Matthew 2:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+27:9">27:9</A>; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+16:14">Matthew 16:14</A>, the King James Version has "Jeremias," but the Revised Version (British and American) in 2 Maccabees and Matthew has "Jeremiah."

<P> (8) A priest who sealed the covenant with Nehemiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:2">Nehemiah 10:2</A>), probably the same as he of 12:34 who took part in the procession at the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem.
