            <P><B>CLEMENT</B><P> klem'-ent (Klemes, "mild"):
<P> A fellow-worker with Paul at Philippi, mentioned with especial commendation in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</A>. The name being common, no inference can be drawn from this statement as to any identity with the author of the Epistle to the Corinthians published under this name, who was also the third bishop of Rome. The truth of this supposition ("it cannot be called a tradition," Donaldson, The Apostolical Fathers, 120), although found in Origen, Eusebius, Epiphanius and Jerome, can neither be proved nor disproved. Even Roman Catholic authorities dispute it (article "Clement," Catholic Cyclopaedia, IV, 13). The remoteness between the two in time and place is against it; "a wholly uncritical view" (Cruttwell, Literary History of Early Christianity, 31).
