            <P><B>KAIN (1)</B><P> kan (ha-qayin; the King James Version Cain):
<P> A town in the hill country of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:57">Joshua 15:57</A>). There is, too, apparently a reference to this place in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+24:21,22">Numbers 24:21,22</A>:
<P> "And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,
<P> Strong is thy dwelling-place,
<P> And thy nest is set in the rock.
<P> Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,
<P> Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive."
<P> This place has been very doubtfully identified as the ruin Yukin, a place on a lofty hill Southeast of Hebron, overlooking the wilderness of Judah; the tomb of Cain is shown there. See PEF, III, 312, Sh XXI.
<P> E. W. G. Masterman
