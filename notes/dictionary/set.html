            <P><B>SET</B><P> Few words in the English language have such a rich variety of meaning and are used in so rich a variety of idiomatic expression as the word "set." A glance at any of the great dictionaries will convince anyone of the truth of this statement. The Standard Dictionary devotes three and a half columns to the word. In its primary meaning it there denotes 22 distinct things, in its secondary meaning 17 more, while 18 distinct phrases are given in which it is used, in some cases again in a variety of meanings. It is indeed a word calculated to drive a foreigner to despair. Some 70 Hebrew and about 30 Greek words in the original tongues of the Holy Scriptures have been rendered by the word "set," in the King James Version and also in the Revised Version (British and American). A careful comparative study of the original and of translations in other tongues will at once indicate that a lack of discrimination is evident on the part of the English translators in the frequent use of the word "set."
<P> Thus in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+5:14">Song of Solomon 5:14</A>, "hands are as rings of gold set with beryl," the Hebrew word is male', "to be filled," "full." Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) translates plenae, the Dutch gevuld, the German voll; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+8:27">Proverbs 8:27</A>, "when he set a circle," Hebrew chaqaq, "to describe," "decree," Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) vallabat, Dutch beschreef; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+4:10">Ezra 4:10</A>, "set in the city of Samaria," Aramaic yethibh, "to cause to sit down," "to cause to dwell," Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) habitare eas fecit, Dutch doen wonen; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+2:6">Psalms 2:6</A>, "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill," Hebrew nacakh, "to pour out," "to anoint," Dutch gezalfd; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+19:2">Isaiah 19:2</A>, the King James Version "I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians," Hebrew cakhakh, "to disturb," "to confuse," Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) concurrere faciam,, Dutch verwarren, German an einander setzen; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</A>, "I have, set before thee a door," Greek didomi, "to give," Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) dedi coram te, Dutch gegeven, German gegeben; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:27">Acts 19:27</A>, the King James Version "Our craft is in danger to be set at nought," Greek erchomai, "to come," Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) periclitabitur, Dutch in verachting komen; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</A>, "to set at liberty them," Greek apostello, "to send away," Dutch heen te zenden in vrijheid; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</A>, the King James Version "Saul .... set his eyes on him," Greek atenizo, "to stare fixedly," Vulgate:
<P> intuens in eum, Dutch de oogen op hem houdende. These are but a few examples chosen at random where our English translators have rendered Hebrew and Greek words by "set," where a more literal translation, in equally good idiomatic language, was possible. The word "set" is the causative of "sit," and indicates primarily a power of self-support, in opposition to the idea of the word "lay."
