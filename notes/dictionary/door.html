            <P><B>DOOR</B><P> dor:
<P> Most commonly the rendering of Hebrew pethach, "doorway," deleth, "door" proper (the two distinguished in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+19:6">Genesis 19:6</A>), or of Greek thura, which represents both meanings. The door proper was usually of wood, frequently sheeted with metal, sometimes of one slab of stone, as shown in excavations in the Hauran. It turned on pivots (the "hinges" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+26:14">Proverbs 26:14</A>) working in sockets above and below, and was provided with a bolt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:17">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:17</A>) or with lock and key (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:23">Judges 3:23</A>). The doorway was enclosed by the stone threshold (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+14:17">1&nbsp;Kings 14:17</A>), the two doorposts on either side, and the lintel above (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+12:7">Exodus 12:7</A>). Doors were frequently two-leaved, and folding ones are mentioned in connection with the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:34">1&nbsp;Kings 6:34</A>). Where "door" is used in connectio with city gates (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:1">Nehemiah 3:1</A>) it refers to the door proper which swings on its hinges as distinguished from the whole structure. The custom of fastening to the doorposts small cases containing a parchment inscribed with the words of
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+6:4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+11:13-21">11:13-21</A> had its origin in the command there given. See also \GATE\; \HOUSE\.
<P> Figurative:
<P> (1) Christ is "the door" into the gospel ministry (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:1,2,7">John 10:1,2,7</A>); ministers must receive their authority from Him, and exercise it in His spirit.
<P> (2) `Through faith in Him also both shepherds and sheep enter into the kingdom of God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:9">John 10:9</A>), and find all their spiritual needs supplied.'
<P> (3) The figure in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+3:20">Revelation 3:20</A> is expressive of Christ's patient, persistent and affectionate appeal to men.
<P> (4) Elsewhere also of opportunity (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+25:10">Matthew 25:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+14:27">Acts 14:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+16:9">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+2:12">2&nbsp;Corinthians 2:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</A>).
<P> (5) Of freedom and power (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+4:3">Colossians 4:3</A>). See also \ACHOR\; \SHEPHERD\.
