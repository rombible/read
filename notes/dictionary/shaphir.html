            <P><B>SHAPHIR</B><P> sha'-fer (shaphir, "glittering"; kalos; the King James Version Saphir):
<P> One of a group of towns mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+1:10-15">Micah 1:10-15</A>. From the association with Gath, Achzib (of Judah) and Mareshah, it would seem that the places mentioned were in Southwestern Palestine. According to Eusebius, in Onomasticon, there was a Sapheir, "in the hill country" (from a confusion with Shamir (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:48">Joshua 15:48</A>), where Septuagint A has Sapheir) between Eleutheropolis and Ascalon. The name probably survives in that of three villages called es-Suafir, in the plain, some 3 1/2 miles Southeast of Ashdod (PEF, II, 413, Sh XV). Cheyne (EB, col. 4282) suggests the white "glittering" hill Tell ec-Cafi, at the entrance to the Wady ec-Sunt, which was known to the Crusaders as Blanchegarde, but this site seems a more probable one for GATH (which see).
