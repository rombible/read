             <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"><B>Ebal, Mount,</B></FONT> <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">a mount in the promised land, on which the Israelites were to "put" the curse which should fall upon them if they disobeyed the commandments of Jehovah. The blessing consequent on obedience was to be similarly localized on Mount Gerizim. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Deuteronomy+11:26-29" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Deuteronomy+11:26-29&amp;t=niv"> 11:26-29</a> ) Ebal and Gerizim are the mounts which form the sides of the fertile valley in which lies <I>Nablus</I> , the ancient Shechem-Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. (They are nearly in the centre of the country of Samaria, about eight hundred feet above Nablus in the valley; and they are so near that all the vast body of the people could hear the words read from either mountain. The experiment has repeatedly been tried in late years. --Ed.) The modern name of Ebal is <I>Sitti Salamiyah</I> , from a Mohammedan female saint, whose tomb is standing on the eastern part of the ridge, a little before the highest point is reached. </FONT></body></html>
