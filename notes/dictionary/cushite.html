            <P><B>CUSHITE</B><P> kush'-it:
<P> Whereas kushi, is elsewhere rendered Ethiopian, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+18:21-32">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:21-32</A> it is rendered Cushite in the Revised Version (British and American) (see CUSHI and compare
 <a href="cushite-woman-ethiopian-woman.html" target="_blank">CUSHITE WOMAN</a>). Its plural, which occurs in Zephaniah, Daniel and 2 Chronicles, also in the form kushiyim, in Amos, is uniformly translated Ethiopians, following Septuagint. The other Old Testament books use simply kush, for people as well as land.
