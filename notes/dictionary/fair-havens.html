            <P><B>FAIR HAVENS</B><P> far ha'-v'-nz (Kaloi Limenes):
<P> A roadstead on the South coast of Crete, about 5 miles East of Cape Matala, the most southerly point of the island. The harbor is formed by a bay, open to the East, and sheltered on the Southwest by two small islands. Here Paul waited for a considerable time (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:9">Acts 27:9</A>); but while it afforded good anchorage and a shelter from North and Northwest winds, "the haven was not commodious to winter in" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:8,12">Acts 27:8,12</A>).
