            <P><B>HITHERTO</B><P> hith'-er-too (to this):
<P> Used of both place and time. It is the translation of various words and phrases:
<P> (1) Of place, `adh halom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+7:18">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:18</A>, "Thou hast brought me hitherto," the Revised Version (British and American) "thus far"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+17:16">1&nbsp;Chronicles 17:16</A>; perhaps <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+7:12">1&nbsp;Samuel 7:12</A>, `adh hennah, "Hitherto hath Yahweh helped us" (in connection with the setting up of the stone Ebenezer)) belongs to this head; hennah is properly an adverb of place; it might always be rendered "thus far."
<P> (2) Of time, `adh koh, "unto this" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+7:16">Exodus 7:16</A>, "Hitherto thou hast not hearkened"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+17:14">Joshua 17:14</A>, "Hitherto Yahweh hath blessed me"); me'az, "from then" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+15:34">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:34</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "in time past"); hale'ah, "beyond," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+18:7">Isaiah 18:7</A>, "terrible from their beginning hitherto," the Revised Version (British and American) "onward"); `adh kah, Aramaic (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+7:28">Daniel 7:28</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "here," margin "hitherto"); `adh hennah, "unto here" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+16:13">Judges 16:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:16">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+71:17">Psalms 71:17</A>, etc.); achri tou deuro (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</A>, "was let (the Revised Version (British and American) "hindered") hitherto"); heos arti, "until now" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+5:17">John 5:17</A>, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" the Revised Version (British and American) "even until now," that is, "on the Sabbath as well as on other days', and I do as He does"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+16:24">John 16:24</A>, "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name:
<P> ask, and ye shall receive," that is "up till now"; "now ask in my name and ye shall receive"); oupo, "not yet" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+3:2">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:2</A>, "Hitherto ye were not able to bear it," the Revised Version (British and American) "not yet").
