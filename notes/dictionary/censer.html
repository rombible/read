            <P><B>CENSER</B><P> sen'-ser:
<P> In the King James Version censer is used as a translation of two Hebrew words, namely, machtah, and miqTereth. The former word is generally rendered "censer," sometimes "firepan," and in three cases (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+25:38">Exodus 25:38</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+37:23">37:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:9">Numbers 4:9</A>) "snuffdish" It denoted a bowl-shaped vessel used for different purposes, namely,
<P> (1) a censer, in which incense was burnt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+10:1">Leviticus 10:1</A>);
<P> (2) a firepan, made of bronze, used in connection with the altar of burnt offering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:3">Exodus 27:3</A>);
<P> (3) a snuffdish, i.e. a receptacle to hold pieces of burnt lamp-wick removed by the tongs or snuffers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+25:38">Exodus 25:38</A>).
<P> Probably in all these cases the same kind of vessel was meant, namely, a bowl-shaped utensil with a handle, not unlike a saucepan. The other Hebrew word (derived from the same root as the word for "incense") denoted a vessel for conveying incense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+8:11">Ezekiel 8:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+26:19">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:19</A>). The Greek word thumiaterion, by which the Septuagint rendered miqTereth, is used also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+9:4">Hebrews 9:4</A>, where the King James Version gives "censer," but the American Standard Revised Version is probably more correct, namely, "altar of incense" (see Commentaries under the word). Compare also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+8:3,1">Revelation 8:3,1</A>, where libanotos, properly the adjective of "frankincense," is translated "censer."
