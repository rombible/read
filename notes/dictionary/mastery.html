<P> "Mastery" occurs twice in the Old Testament and twice in the King James Version of the New Testament: in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+32:18">Exodus 32:18</A> (gebhurah, "might"), "the voice of them that shout for mastery"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+6:24">Daniel 6:24</A> ([~shelet, "to have power"), "The lions had the mastery of them"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+9:25">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:25</A>, agonizomai, "to contend for a prize," to be a combatant in the public games, is translated "striveth for the mastery," the Revised Version (British and American) "striventh in the games"; and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+2:5">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:5</A>, athelo, with the same meaning, is translated "strive for masteries," the Revised Version (British and American) "contend in the games." From the Greek we have the words "athlete," etc..
