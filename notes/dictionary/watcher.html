            <P><B>WATCHER</B><P> woch'-er (Aramaic 'ir, "wakeful one"):
<P> In Nebuchadnezzar's dream (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+4:13,17,23">Daniel 4:13,17,23</A>)) a messenger who with "a holy one" descended from heaven, they having joint authority to issue decrees. In the apocryphal literature the doctrine of the "watchers" is much elaborated. In Jubilees they are regarded as angels sent to instruct mankind in righteousness. In Enoch they sometimes appear as archangels and at other times as fallen angels. In the latter condition only we find them in the Book of Adam and Eve. The place of descent was according to Enoch 6:6 the summit of Mt. Hermon.
