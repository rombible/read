<P> Found in the past tense in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+16:20">Exodus 16:20</A> as a translation of rum = "to bring up," "to rise." In this verse, the manna is said to have arisen, i.e. "become alive" (with worms), to indicate that God's gifts are spoiled by selfish and miserly hoarding. The pres. act. occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+8:17">Genesis 8:17</A> for sharats = "to wriggle," "swarm," "abound," hence, "breed abundantly"; and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:14">Deuteronomy 32:14</A> for ben = "son," "descendant," "child," "colt," "calf," "breed." The present participle is found in Zec 2:9 the King James Version for mimshaq, a derivative of mesheq = "possession," "territory," "field." The passage in question should therefore be translated "field of nettles" (the Revised Version (British and American) "possession of nettles").
