<P> Found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:39">Mark 5:39</A> King James Version: "Why make ye this ado and weep?" Here "make ado" is used to translate the Greek verb thorubeomai (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+9:23">Matthew 9:23</A> the King James Version, where it is likewise rendered "making a noise"). "Ado" as a substantive is Old English for "trouble" or "fuss," used only in the sing.; and in the early English versions it combined well with the verb "make," as here, to translate the Greek word rendered elsewhere "causing an uproar," or "tumult," "making a noise," etc. (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:10">20:10</A>). Compare Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, III, 4, "We'll keep no great ado;--a friend or two."
