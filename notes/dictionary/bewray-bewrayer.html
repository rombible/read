            <P><B>BEWRAY; BEWRAYER</B><P> be-ra', be-ra'-er:
<P> In its derivation is entirely different from betray (Latin, tradere), and meant originally "to disclose," "reveal" (compare Shakspere, Titus Andronicus, II, iv, 3: "Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so"); but has been affected by the former word and is used almost synonymously. It is the translation of three Hebrew words:
<P> (1) qara', meaning "to call out" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+27:16">Proverbs 27:16</A>), "the ointment of his right hand which bewrayeth itself" (the American Standard Revised Version "his right hand encountereth oil," the American Revised Version, margin "the oil of his right hand betrayeth itself");
<P> (2) naghadh meaning "to front," "to announce" (by word of mouth):
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+29:24">Proverbs 29:24</A>, "heareth cursing and bewrayeth it not" (the American Standard Revised Version "heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing");
<P> (3) galah, "to denude," figuratively, "to reveal" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+16:3">Isaiah 16:3</A>), "bewray not him that wandereth" (the American Standard Revised Version "betray not the fugitive").
<P> In Sirach 27:17 "bewray (the Revised Version (British and American) "reveal") his secrets" is the translation of apokalupto, literally "to uncover"; so also in Sirach 27:21 (the Revised Version (British and American) "revealeth"). Bewrayer of 2 Macc 4:1 ("bewrayer of. the money and of his country," the Revised Version (British and American) "had given information of the money and had betrayed his country") is the translation of endeiktes, literally, "one who shows."
<P> In the New Testament "bewrayeth" is the King James Version of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</A>; "thy speech bewrayeth thee" is the translation of the phrase delon poiein, which the American Standard Revised Version renders "maketh thee known."
<P> Arthur J. Kinsella
