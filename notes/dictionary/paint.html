            <P><B>PAINT</B><P> pant (from Old French peinctre, frequentative of peindre, Latin pingo, "to paint"):
<P> (1) From Hebrew verb mashach, "to smear," "to anoint," "to paint," describing the painting of interiors with vermilion, perhaps resembling lacquer:
<P> "ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+22:14">Jeremiah 22:14</A>). The shields of the Ninevite soldiers were red, presumably painted (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=na+2:3">Nahum 2:3</A>).
<P> (2) From noun pukh, "paint," "antimon," "stibium," "black mineral powder" used as a cosmetic, to lend artificial size and fancied beauty to the eye, always spoken of as a meretricious device, indicating light or unworthy character. Jezebel "painted her eyes, and attired her head" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+9:30">2&nbsp;Kings 9:30</A>, literally, "put pukh into her eyes"). To the harlot city Jerusalem, Jeremiah (4:30) says, "deckest thee ...., enlargest thine eyes with paint" (pukh). the King James Version renders "rentest thy face," as if the stain were a cut, or the enlarging done by violence.
<P> (3) From verb kachal, "to smear," "to paint." Ezekiel says to Oholah-Oholibah (Judah-Israel), "didst wash thyself, paint (kachal) thine eyes," as the adulteress prepares herself for her paramour (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+23:40">Ezekiel 23:40</A>). The antimony, in an extremely fine powder (Arabic kuchl, from kachal), is placed in the eye by means of a very fine rod, bodkin, or probe, drawn between the edges of the eyelids. This distends the eye, and also increases its apparent size, the effect being increased by a line of stain drawn from the corner, and by a similar line prolonging the eyebrow.
