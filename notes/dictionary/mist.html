            <P><B>MIST</B><P> ('edh; achlus, homichie):
<P> Mist is caused by particles of water vapor filling the air until it is only partially transparent. Mist and haze produce much the same effect, the one being due to moisture in the atmosphere and the other to dust particles. Mist or fog is not common on the plains of Palestine and Syria at sea-level, but is of almost daily occurrence in the mountain valleys, coming up at night and disappearing with the morning sun (The Wisdom of Solomon 2:4). It is nothing else than a cloud touching the land. In the account of creation, "there went up a mist from the earth," giving a description of the warm humid atmosphere of the carboniferous ages which agrees remarkably with the teaching of modern science (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:6">Genesis 2:6</A>). The word is used figuratively in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</A> to describe the shutting out of light. Those who bring confusion and uncertainty are compared to "mists driven by a storm" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:17">2&nbsp;Peter 2:17</A>).
