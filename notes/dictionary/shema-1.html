            <P><B>SHEMA (1)</B><P> she'-ma (shema`; Samaa):
<P> A city of Judah in the Negeb (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:26">Joshua 15:26</A>). If, as some think, identical with SHEBA (which see) of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:2">Joshua 19:2</A>, then the latter must have been inserted here from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:26">Joshua 15:26</A>. It is noticeable that the root letters (sh-m-`) were those from which Simeon is derived. Shema is probably identical with Jeshua (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:26">Nehemiah 11:26</A>). The place was clearly far South, and it may be Kh. Sa`wah, a ruin upon a prominent hilltop between Kh. `Attir and Khirbet el-Milch. There is a wall around the ruins, of large blocks of conglomerate flint (PEF, III, 409, Sh XXV).
