Its ceremonial is described in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/3-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/3-1.html">Leviticus 3:1</a> ) ... The peace offerings, unlike other sacrifices, were not ordained to be offered in fixed and regular course. The only constantly-recurring peace offering appears to have been that of the two firstling lambs at Pentecost. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/23-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/23-19.html">Leviticus 23:19</a> ) The general principle of the peace offering seems to have been that it should be entirely spontaneous, offered as occasion should arise, from the feeling of the sacrificer himself.

( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/6-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/6-14.html">Numbers 6:14</a> ) We find accordingly peace offerings offered for the people on a great scale at periods of unusual solemnity or rejoicing. In two cases only -- ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/20-26.html">Judges 20:26</a> ;  2&nbsp;Samuel 24:26 ) --peace offerings are mentioned se offered with burnt offerings at a time of national sorrow and fasting. </FONT></body></html>
