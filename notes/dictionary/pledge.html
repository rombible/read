<P> All these words have about the same meaning.
<P> (1) The "pledge" is, as in modern English, security given for future payment (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+38:17-24">Genesis 38:17-24</A>) or conduct (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+2:6">Habakkuk 2:6</A>, where the conquered nations have given guaranties of their subserviency to the Chaldeans; the King James Version's "thick clay" here rests on a misreading of the Hebrew). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:23">2&nbsp;Kings 18:23</A> (equals <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+36:8">Isaiah 36:8</A>) the "pledge" is a wager (so the Revised Version margin). Rabshakeh mockingly dares Hezekiah to stake a "pledge" that he can produce 2,000 men for the defense of Jerusalem, although the mighty Assyrian host has that number of horses alone. The general point of the obscure passage <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+20:16">Proverbs 20:16</A> (equals 27:13) is that he who guarantees strangers needs a guaranty himself. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+17:18">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:18</A> is uncertain and the text may be corrupt. If not, the "pledge" is some (prearranged?) token of the welfare of David's brethren.
<P> (2) Most of the occurrences of "pledge," however, deal with the debts of the very poor, who had no property that they could spare even temporarily. Consequently, the exaction of a pledge from such persons worked genuine hardship, and to take a pledge at all was a cruel act (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+24:3">Job 24:3</A>), although of course the dishonesty of withholding a pledge (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+18:7">Ezekiel 18:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+33:15">33:15</A>) was worse. Lowest in the scale was the creditor who took the garment the borrower was wearing (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+2:8">Amos 2:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+22:6">Job 22:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+24:9">24:9</A> margin), and special legislation controlled this practice. A garment (the outer "cloak" (see DRESS) not worn while doing manual labor) so taken must be restored at night (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:26">Exodus 22:26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:12,13">Deuteronomy 24:12,13</A>), for it was the usual covering of the sleeper. (Apparently, though, the creditor regained custody of it in the daytime until the debt was paid.) A widow's clothing, however, was entirely exempt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:17">Deuteronomy 24:17</A>), as was the handmill used for bread-making (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:6">Deuteronomy 24:6</A>). The lender had no right of entry into the borrower's house to obtain the pledge (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:10,11">Deuteronomy 24:10,11</A>), but it is not said that he could not dictate what he would accept; indeed, the contrary is inconceivable.
<P> (3) the American Standard Revised Version gives "pledge" for the King James Version and the English Revised Version "faith" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:12">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:12</A>.
