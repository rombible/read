<P> Mother of King Jeroboam I (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+11:26">1&nbsp;Kings 11:26</A>), the Septuagint, Codex Vaticanus and Lucian omit the name in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+11:26">1&nbsp;Kings 11:26</A>, but the long the Septuagint after Massoretic Text of 12:24 reads (12:24b): "And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, a servant of Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam, and the name of his mother was Sareisa (Septuagint has Sareisa), a harlot."
