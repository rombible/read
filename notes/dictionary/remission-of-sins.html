            <P><B>REMISSION OF SINS</B><P> re-mish'-un (aphesis, paresis):
<P> The two Greek words, of which the latter occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</A>, were translated by the same English word in the King James Version. In the Revised Version (British and American), paresis is translation "passing over." It is contrasted with the other term as pretermission with remission. Remission is exemption from the consequences of an offense, forgiveness; pretermission is the suspension of the penalty (Philippi, Ellicott, Trench (Synonyms, XXXIII), Weiss; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:30">Acts 17:30</A>). Cremer (Lexicon of N T Gr) regards the meaning of the two words as identical, except that the one refers to the Old Testament and the other to the New Testament. Sins are remitted when the offender is treated as though the offense had never been committed. Remission is restricted to the penalty, while forgiveness refers more particularly to the person, although it may be used also of the sin itself. Remission also is used of offenses against God's law; forgiveness, against either divine or human law.
<P> See ABSOLUTION; FORGIVENESS.
