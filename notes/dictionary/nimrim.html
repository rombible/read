            <P><B>NIMRIM</B><P> nim'-rim (me nimrim; Codex Vaticanus Nebrein; Codex Alexandrinus Ebrim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:34">Jeremiah 48:34</A>); to hudor tes Nimreim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:6">Isaiah 15:6</A>)):
<P> The meaning appears to be "pure" or "wholesome water." The name occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:6">Isaiah 15:6</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:34">Jeremiah 48:34</A> in oracles against Moab. In each case it is mentioned in association with Zoar and Horonaim. It is therefore probably to be sought to the Southeast of the Dead Sea. Eusebius, Onomasticon, places a town, Bennamareim, to the Nimrim of Zoar, and identifies it with the Old Testament "Nimrim," as it seems, correctly. The name is still found in Wady Numeireh, opening on the sea at Burj Numeirah, Nimrim of Ghor es-Safiyeh. The waters of Nimrim may be sought either in Moiyet Numeirah or in the spring higher up, where lie the ruins of a town in a well-watered and fruitful district (Buhl, GAP, 272).
