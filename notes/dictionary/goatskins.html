<P> Such skins are mentioned only once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:37">Hebrews 11:37</A>), where the wearing of goatskins, indicating extreme poverty, is referred to, by implication, as the possible lot of the faithful Christian, even as it had been of others. Ascetics of different religions, especially of the Moslem sects, are frequently seen going about Syria and Palestine today, clad in sheepskins or goatskins, a sign of their renunciation of all things worldly.
