            <P><B>HOLDING</B><P> hol'-ding:
<P> Occurs with various shades of meaning:
<P> (1) as the translation of tamakh, "to acquire," it has the sense of taking, obtaining (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+33:15">Isaiah 33:15</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe," the English Revised Version, as the King James Version, "holding");
<P> (2) of kul, "to hold," "contain," having the sense of containing or restraining (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+6:11">Jeremiah 6:11</A>, "I am weary with holding in");
<P> (3) of krateo, "to receive," "observe," "maintain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</A>, "holding the tradition of the elders"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+1:19">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:19</A>, echo, "holding faith and a good conscience"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+3:9">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:9</A>, "holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience");
<P> (4) holding fast, cleaving to, krateo (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</A>, "not holding the head," the Revised Version (British and American) "holding fast"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+7:1">Revelation 7:1</A>, "holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow"); antechomai, "to hold over against one's self," "to hold fast" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "holding to the faithful word");
<P> (5) holding forth, epecho, "to hold upon, to hold out toward" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</A>, "holding forth the word of life," so the Revised Version (British and American)); Lightfoot has "holding out" (as offering); others, however, render "holding fast," persevering in the Christian faith and life--connecting with being "blameless and harmless" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</A>.
