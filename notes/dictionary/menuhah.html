            <P><B>MENUHAH</B><P> men-u'-ha, men-u'-ka (menuchah, "place of rest"; the King James Version Menuchah):
<P> Rendered in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:43">Judges 20:43</A> the King James Version "with ease," the Revised Version (British and American) "at their resting-place." Both, however, have a marginal suggestion which would make the word a place-name, which would then more naturally read "from Nuhah over against Gibeah," thus describing the ground over which the slaughter of the Benjamites occurred. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:2">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:2</A> the word "Nohah" occurs as that of a Benjamite elan. The place intended is perhaps MANAHATH (which see).
