            <P><B>ELYMAIS</B><P> el-i-ma'-is (Elumais):
<P> This name, representing the Old Testament Elam (see <a href="elam.html" target="_blank">ELAM</a>), was given to a district of Persia lying South of Media and North of Susiana. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ma+6:1">1&nbsp;Maccabees 6:1</A> the common reading, which is adopted by the King James Version, refers to Elymais as a rich city in Persia. No other reference, however, to such a city is found except in Josephus (Ant., XII, ix, 1) who simply follows 1 Macc. The text should therefore be corrected to read as in the Revised Version (British and American), "in Elymais in Persia there was a city."
