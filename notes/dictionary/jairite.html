            <P><B>JAIRITE</B><P> ja'-er-it (ya'iri, "of Jair"):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+20:26">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:26</A>, Ira the Jairite is "chief minister unto David." He was a descendant of Jair who was a Manassite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:41">Numbers 32:41</A>, etc.) and whose territory was in Gilead. Septuagint, Lucian, and Syriac suggest yattiri, "Jattirite," i.e. a native of Jattir mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+30:27">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:27</A> as one of the towns friendly to David when he was in Ziklag. It is not improbable that a native of Jattir would be given such a post by David.
<P> See IRA, and compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:38">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:38</A>.
