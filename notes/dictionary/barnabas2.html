In ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/9-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/9-27.html">Acts 9:27</a> ) we find him introducing the newly-converted Saul to the apostles at Jerusalem. Barnabas was sent to Jerusalem, ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Acts+11:19-26" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Acts+11:19-26&amp;t=niv">Acts 11:19-26</a> ) and went to Tarsus to seek Saul, as one specially raised up to preach to the Gentiles. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/26-17.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/26-17.html">Acts 26:17</a> ) He brought him to Antioch, and was sent with him to Jerusalem. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/11-30.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/11-30.html">Acts 11:30</a> ) On their return, they were ordained by the church for the missionary work, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-2.html">Acts 13:2</a> ) and sent forth (A.D. 45). From this time Barnabas and Paul enjoy the title and dignity of apostles. Their first missionary journey is related in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-14.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-14.html">Acts 13:14</a> ) Returning to Antioch (A.D. 47 or 48), they were sent (A.D. 50), with some others, to Jerusalem. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-1.html">Acts 15:1</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-36.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-36.html">Acts 15:36</a> ) Afterwards they parted and Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus, his native island. Here the Scripture notices of him cease. The epistle attributed to Barnabas is believed to have been written early in the second century. </FONT></body></html>
