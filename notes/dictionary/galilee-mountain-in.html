            <P><B>GALILEE, MOUNTAIN IN</B><P> After the resurrection the disciples "went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</A>). Here Jesus came to them, declared that all authority in heaven and earth had been given to Him, commanded them to go and make disciples of all nations, concluding with the memorable promise:
<P> "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." Probably it was some well-known height not far from the scenes most frequented during the Galilean ministry. Looking from the western shore at the uplands North of the lake, it is not easy to imagine a more appropriate spot for this never-to-be-forgotten interview than Jebel Qan`-an, a bold headland not far to the East of Cafed, overlooking the land of Gennesaret and the sea, and commanding from its lofty summit a view of about 80 miles in every direction. Of course, there is no certainty.
