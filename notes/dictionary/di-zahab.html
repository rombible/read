            <P><B>DI-ZAHAB</B><P> di'-za-hab, diz'-a-hab di-za-habh; Septuagint Katachrusea, (literally, "abounding in gold"):
<P> The name occurs in a list apparently intended to fix definitely the situation of the camp of Israel in the plains of Moab (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:1">Deuteronomy 1:1</A>). No place in the region has been found with a name suggesting this; and there is no other clue to its identification. Some names in the list are like those of stations earlier in the wanderings. Thinking that one of these may be intended Burckhardt suggested Mina edh-Dhahab, a boat harbor between Ras Mohammad and `Aqaba. Cheyne gets over the difficulty by accepting a suggestion of Sayee that Di-zahab corresponds to Me-zahab (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:39">Genesis 36:39</A>); this latter he then transforms into Mitzraim, and identifies it with the North Arabian Mucri (Encyclopedia Biblica, under the word). The changes, however, seem greater than can be justified.
