There can be little doubt that the wood here spoken of is that of the <I>Thuya articulata</I> , Desfont the <I>Callitris quadrivalvis</I> of present botanists. It is a cone bearing tree and allied to the pine. This tree was much prized by Greeks and Romans on account of the beauty of its wood for various ornamental purposes. By the Romans the tree was called <I>citrus</I> , the wood <I>citrum</I> . It is a native of Barbary, and grows to the height of 15 to 25 feet. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
