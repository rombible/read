            <P><B>ELNATHAN</B><P> el-na'-than ('elnathan, "God has given"):
<P> (1) The grandfather of Jehoiachin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+24:8">2&nbsp;Kings 24:8</A>).
<P> (2) A courtier of Jehoiakim; he was one of those sent to Egypt to bring back the prophet Uriah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+26:22">Jeremiah 26:22</A>), and one of those who heard the reading of Jeremiah's roll and entreated Jehoiakim not to burn the roll (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+36:12,25">Jeremiah 36:12,25</A>)--possibly the same person as (1) above.
<P> (3, 4, 5) The name of two "chief men"--unless textual corruption has introduced the name at its second occurrence--and of one "teacher" sent for by Ezra from the camp at the river Ahava (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:16">Ezra 8:16</A>).
<P> F. K. Farr
