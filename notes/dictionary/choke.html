            <P><B>CHOKE</B><P> chok (pnigo, and its compounds):
<P> Is used in its primary sense of "to strangle," or "to suffocate," in describing the fate of the swine (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+8:33">Luke 8:33</A> the King James Version). The Revised Version (British and American) has "drowned," but "choked" is the correct rendering of the Greek word.
<P> Figurative:
<P> It is used in the sense of "to strangle" "smother," "suffocate," as if by depriving of breath, in describing the fate of the young grain growing in the midst of thorns (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:7">Matthew 13:7</A>). The figurative is carried a little farther still in describing the way the word, planted in the heart, is overcome by the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</A>).
<P> A. W. Fortune
