            <P><B>GEBIM</B><P> ge'-bim (gebhim, "trenches"):
<P> A place named only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:31">Isaiah 10:31</A>. Some would place it at Jebia, identifying it with the Geba of Eusebius, 5 Roman miles from Gophna (modern Jifneh), on the way to Shechem. Its place, however, in the order of names, after Anathoth, seems to point to some position South of that village, to the Northeast of Jerusalem.
