<P> Only in the Old Testament, translating Hebrew ribh, a word which is more frequently rendered "strive." Since in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+31:36">Genesis 31:36</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+8:1">Judges 8:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+103:9">Psalms 103:9</A>, the strife is one of words, it means in these passages, "scold," or "sharply censure," and is applied either to mutinous protests and reproaches of inferiors to a superior, or, as in the last of these passages, to rebukes administered by a superior to inferiors.
