            <P><B>UCAL</B><P> u'-kal ('ukhal (see below)):
<P> This name occurs along with that of Ithiel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:1">Proverbs 30:1</A>), both being taken by older interpreters as those of ancient sages. Some have suggested (see Toy, Proverbs, 519 f) that Ucal might be the "Caleol" of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:31">1&nbsp;Kings 4:31</A> (Hebrew 5:11). Ucal was also explained as "I can," i.e. "I can maintain my obedience to God," just as Ithiel was taken to be "signs of God." Septuagint, Aquila, Theodotion do not take the words as proper names, and so BDB with others point this word as a vb., "(and) I am consumed" (wa'ekhel, for [~we'ukhal). The last three words of the verse are then translated "I have wearied myself, O God, I have wearied myself, O God, and am consumed."
<P> See ITHIEL.
