            <P><B>AMASAI</B><P> a-ma'-si (`amasay, perhaps rather to be read `ammishay; so Wellhausen, IJG, II, 24, n.2):
<P> (1) A name in the genealogy of Kohath, son of Elkanah, a Levite of the Kohathite family (compare
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:25">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+29:12">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:12</A>).
<P> (2) Chief of the captains who met David at Ziklag and tendered him their allegiance. Some have identified him with Amasa and others with Abishai, who is called Abshai in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:20">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:20</A> m (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+18:12">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:12</A>). The difficulty is that neither Amasa nor Abishai occupied the rank of the chief of thirty according to the lists in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23">2&nbsp;Samuel 23</A> and
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11</A>, the rank to which David is supposed to have appointed into (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:18">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:18</A>).
<P> (3) One of the trumpet-blowing priests who greeted David when he brought back the Ark of the Covenant (compare
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:24">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:24</A>).
