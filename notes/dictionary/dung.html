The manure consisted either of straw steeped in liquid manure, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/25-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/25-10.html">Isaiah 25:10</a> ) or the sweepings, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/5-25.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/5-25.html">Isaiah 5:25</a> ) of the streets and roads, which were carefully removed from about the houses, and collected in heaps outside the walls of the towns at fixed spots --hence the dung-gate at Jerusalem --and thence removed in due course to the fields. The difficulty of procuring fuel in Syria, Arabia and Egypt has made dung in all ages valuable as a substitute. It was probably used for heating ovens and for baking cakes, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/4-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/4-12.html">Ezra 4:12</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/4-15.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/4-15.html">Ezra 4:15</a> ) the equable heat which it produced adapting it pecularily for the latter operation. Cows and camels dung is still used for a similar purpose by the Bedouins. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
