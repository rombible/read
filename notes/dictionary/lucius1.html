He is thought by some to be the same with Lucius of Cyrene. <LI>Lucius of Cyrene is first mentioned in the New Testament in company with Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Manaen and Saul, who are described as prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-1.html">Acts 13:1</a> ) Whether Lucius was one of the seventy disciples is quite a matter of conjecture; but it is highly probable that he formed one of the congregation to whom St. Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-10.html">Acts 2:10</a> ) and there can hardly be a doubt that he was one of "the men of Cyrene" who, being "scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen," went to Antioch preaching the Lord Jesus.
