            <P><B>PECULIAR</B><P> pe-kul'-yar:
<P> The Latin peculium means "private property," so that "peculiar" properly equals "pertaining to the individual." In modern English the word has usually degenerated into a half-colloquial form for "extraordinary," but in Biblical English it is a thoroughly dignified term for "esp. one's own"; compare the "peculiar treasure" of the king in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+2:8">Ecclesiastes 2:8</A> (the King James Version). Hence, "peculiar people" (the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:2">Deuteronomy 14:2</A>, etc.) means a people especially possessed by God and particularly prized by Him. The word in the Old Testament (the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+19:5">Exodus 19:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:2">Deuteronomy 14:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+26:18">26:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+135:4">Psalms 135:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+2:8">Ecclesiastes 2:8</A>) invariably represents ceghullah, "property," an obscure word which Septuagint usually rendered by the equally obscure periousios (apparently meaning "superabundant"), which in turn is quoted in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</A>. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mal+3:17">Malachi 3:17</A>, however, Septuagint has peripoiesis, quoted in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+2:9">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</A>. the English Revised Version in the New Testament substituted "own possession" in the two occurrences, but in the Old Testament kept "peculiar" and even extended its use (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+7:6">Deuteronomy 7:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mal+3:17">Malachi 3:17</A>) to cover every occurrence of ceghullah except in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+29:3">1&nbsp;Chronicles 29:3</A> ("treasure"). the American Standard Revised Version, on the contrary, has dropped "peculiar" altogether, using "treasure" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+29:3">1&nbsp;Chronicles 29:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+2:8">Ecclesiastes 2:8</A>, and "own possession" elsewhere. the King James Version also has "peculiar commandments" (idios, "particular," the Revised Version (British and American) "several") in The Wisdom of Solomon 19:6, and the Revised Version (British and American) has "peculiar" where the King James Version has "special" in The Wisdom of Solomon 3:14 for eklekte, "chosen out."
