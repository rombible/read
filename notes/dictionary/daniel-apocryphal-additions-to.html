The most important are contained in the Apocrypha of the English Bible under the titles of <I>The Son of the Three Holy Children, The History of Susannah,</I> and <I>The History of...Bel and the Dragon.</I> The first of these is supposed to be the triumphal song of the three confessors in the furnace, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/daniel/3-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/daniel/3-23.html">Daniel 3:23</a> ) praising God for their deliverance, of which a chief part (35-66) has been used as a hymn in the Christian Church since the fourth century. The second, called also <I>The Judgment of Daniel</I> , relates the story of the clearing of Susannah from a charge of adultery; and the third gives an exaggerated account of Daniels deliverance. </FONT></body></html>
