            <P><B>POUND</B><P> pound (maneh; mna, litra; Latin, libra):
<P> Pound does not correctly represent the Hebrew maneh, which was more than a pound (see MANEH). The litra of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+12:3">John 12:3</A> and 19:39 is the Roman pound (libra) of 4,950 grains, which is less than a pound troy, being about 10 1/3 oz. In a monetary sense (its use in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:13-25">Luke 19:13-25</A>) it is the mna, or maneh, which was either of silver or gold, the former, which is probably the one referred to by Luke, being equal to 6,17 British pounds, or about  (in 1915); the latter 102,10 British pounds or  (in 1915).
<P> See WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
<P> Figurative:
<P> "Pound," like "talent," is used in the New Testament for intellectual gifts and spiritual endowments, as in the passage given above.
