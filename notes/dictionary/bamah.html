            <P><B>BAMAH</B><P> ba'-ma, ba'-ma (bamah, "high place"):
<P> The word appears in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+20:29">Ezekiel 20:29</A> where reference is made to former "high-place worship," the prophet speaking with contempt of such manner of worship. Ewald suggests a play of words, ba', "come" and mah, "what," "what (mah) is the high place (ba-mah) whereunto ye come (ba')?" It is possible that reference is made to a prominent high place like the one at Gibeon (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+3:4">1&nbsp;Kings 3:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+16:39">1&nbsp;Chronicles 16:39</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+21:29">21:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+13">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13</A>) for which the name "Bamah" was retained after the reform mentioned by the prophet.
