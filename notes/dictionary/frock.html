            <P><B>FROCK</B><P> frok (simlah; homolinon):
<P> The hempen frock, mentioned in Ecclesiasticus 40:4 as a mark of the lowly, was a simple garment consisting of a square piece of cloth wrapped around the body. It is the same as the garment (simlah) which we find the poor man using as his only bed covering by night (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+22:26">Exodus 22:26</A>); the traveler, as the receptacle for his belongings (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+12:34">Exodus 12:34</A>); and the common people of both sexes as their general outer garments, though there was some difference in appearance between the simlah of the man and that of the woman (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+22:5">Deuteronomy 22:5</A>).
<P> See DRESS.
