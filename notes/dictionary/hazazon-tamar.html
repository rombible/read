            <P><B>HAZAZON-TAMAR</B><P> haz'-a-zan-ta'-mar (chatsatson tamar; the King James Version Hazezon Tamar):
<P> "Hazazon of the palm trees," mentioned (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+14:7">Genesis 14:7</A>) as a place of the Amorites, conquered, together with En-mishpat and the country of the Amalekites, by Chedorlaomer; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+20:2">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:2</A> it is identified with EN-GEDI (which see); and if so, it must have been its older name. If this identification be accepted, then Hazazon may survive in the name Wady Husasah, Northwest of `Ain Jidy. Another suggestion, which certainly meets the needs of the narrative better, is that Hazazon-tamar is the Thamara of Eusebius, Onomasticon (85 3; 210 86), the Thamaro, of Ptol. xvi.3. The ruin Kurnub, 20 miles West-Southwest of the South end of the Dead Sea--on the road from Hebron to Elath--is supposed to mark this site.
