Hezekiah was one of the three most perfect kings of Judah.

His first act was to purge and repair and reopen with splendid sacrifices and perfect ceremonial the temple. He also destroyed a brazen serpent, said to have been the one used by Moses in the miraculous healing of the Israelites, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/21-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/21-9.html">Numbers 21:9</a> ) which had become an object of adoration. When the kingdom of Israel had fallen, Hezekiah invited the scattered inhabitants to a peculiar passover, which was continued for the unprecedented period of fourteen days. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/29-30.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/29-30.html">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/29-31.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/29-31.html">2 Chronicles 29:31</a> ) At the head of a repentant and united people, Hezekiah ventured to assume the aggressive against the Philistines and in a series of victories not only rewon the cities which his father had lost, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/28-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/28-18.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:18</a> ) but even dispossessed them of their own cities except Gaza, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/18-8.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/18-8.html">2&nbsp;Kings 18:8</a> ) and Gath. He refused to acknowledge the supremacy of Assyria.

The prophet had hardly left the palace when he was ordered to return and promise the king immediate recovery and fifteen years more of life.

For this Isaiah foretells the punishment that shall befall his house.

The first of these took place in the third year of Sennacherib, B.C. 702, and occupies only three verses.

Sennacherib sent against Jerusalem an army under two officers and his cupbearer, the orator Rabshakeh, with a blasphemous and insulting summons to surrender; but Isaiah assures the king he need not fear, promising to disperse the enemy.

Hezekiah only lived to enjoy for about one year more his well-earned peace and glory. He slept with his fathers after a reign of twenty-nine years, in the 56th year of his age, B.C. 697. <LI>Son of Neariah, one of the descendants of the royal family of Judah.
