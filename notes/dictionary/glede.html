            <P><B>GLEDE</B><P> gled (ra`ah; gups):
<P> A member of the hawk species. It is given among the list of abominations in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:13">Deuteronomy 14:13</A>, but not in the Le list (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:14">Leviticus 11:14</A>). The kite is substituted. The Arabs might have called one of the buzzards the glede. In England, where specimens of most of these birds appear in migration, the glede is synonymous with kite, and was given the name from glide, to emphasize a gliding motion in flight. See illustration, p. 1235.
