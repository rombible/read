<P> The early inhabitants of the southern extremity of Canaan afterward occupied by the Philistines (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+2:23">Deuteronomy 2:23</A>; compare Jos 13:3,4, the King James Version "Avim," a'-vim).
<P> The Avvim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+18:23">Joshua 18:23</A> was a town of Benjamin, not a people. Gesenius supposes the name to mean "dwellers in the desert," but it was more probably the name of some pre-Sem tribe. The Avvim are described as living in Chatserim or "encampments" and extending as far as the outskirts of Gaza.
