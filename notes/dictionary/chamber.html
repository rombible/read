            <P><B>CHAMBER</B><P> cham'-ber (the translation of the following Hebrew words:
<P> chedher, chuppah, yatsia`, yatsua`, lishkah, nishkah, `aliyah, tsela`, and the Aramaic word `illith): For the most part the word chamber is the expression of an idea which would be adequately expressed by the English word "room," in accordance with an earlier use of the word, now little employed. For the arrangement of rooms in a Hebrew house, see <a href="house.html" target="_blank">HOUSE</a>. Chedher is a word of frequent occurrence, and designates a private room. Chuppah is translated "chamber" only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+19:5">Psalms 19:5</A>, where it is used in connection with "bridegroom," and means a bridal chamber. The same Hebrew word used of the bride in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joe+2:16">Joel 2:16</A> is rendered "closet." Yatsia` and yatsua` are found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:5,6,10">1&nbsp;Kings 6:5,6,10</A> (the King James Version only in all the passages), yatsua` being the reading of Kethibh and yatsia` of Kere in each ease. Here the meaning is really "story," as given in the Revised Version (British and American), except in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:6">1&nbsp;Kings 6:6</A>, where doubtless the text should be changed to read ha-tsela`, "the side-chamber." Lishkah, a frequent word, and the equivalent nishkah, infrequent, are used ordinarily of a room in the temple utilized for sacred purposes, occasionally of a room in the palace. `Aliyah and the equivalent Aramaic `illith signify "a roof chamber," i.e. a chamber built on the flat roof of a house. Tsela`, when used of a chamber, designates a side-chamber of the temple. It is usually rendered "side-chamber," but "chamber" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+6:5,8">1&nbsp;Kings 6:5,8</A> (the King James Version), where the Revised Version (British and American) has "side-chamber."
