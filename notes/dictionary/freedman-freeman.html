            <P><B>FREEDMAN; FREEMAN</B><P> fred'-man, fre'-man:
<P> The term occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+7:22">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</A>, and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+6:15">Revelation 6:15</A>, and represents two slightly different words. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+7:22">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:22</A> the word is apeleutheros, "a freeman," one who was born a slave and has received freedom. In this case it refers to spiritual freedom. He that was in bondage to sin has been presented with spiritual freedom by the Lord. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+6:15">Revelation 6:15</A> the word is simply eleutheros, "a free man" as opposed to a slave.
