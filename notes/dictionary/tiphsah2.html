It was known to the Greeks and Romans under the name of Thapsacus, and was the point where it was usual to cross the Euphrates. Thapsacus has been generally placed at the modern <I>Deir</I> ; but the Euphrates expedition proved that there is no ford at <I>Deir</I> , and that the only ford in this part of the course of the Euphrates is at <I>Suriyeh</I> , 45 miles below Balis, and 165 above <I>Deir</I> . This, then, must have been the position of Thapsacus. </FONT></body></html>
