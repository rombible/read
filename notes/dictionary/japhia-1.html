            <P><B>JAPHIA (1)</B><P> ja-fi'-a, jaf'-i-a (yaphia`, perhaps "tall"; compare Arabic; Iephtha):
<P> (1) King of Lachish, one of the 5 "kings of the Amorites" who allied themselves together in an expedition against Gibeon on account of its treaty with the Israelites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+10:3-5">Joshua 10:3-5</A>). After their discomfiture by Joshua in the battle of Beth-horon (10:10), "one of the most important in the history of the world" (Stanley), they fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah (10:16). As Joshua passed, he was informed of this, but, unwilling to delay his pursuit of the fugitives, he ordered great stones to be rolled unto the mouth of the cave, leaving a guard in charge (10:17 f). On the completion of his victory, Joshua returned to Makkedah and commanded the Israelites to bring forth the imprisoned kings, and summoned the chiefs of his army to plant their feet upon their necks. Then he put them to death; and after he had hung their bodies on 5 trees, he ordered the Israelites in the evening to take them down and cast them into the cave (10:22-27).
<P> (2) Septuagint Iephies, Iaphie):
<P> One of the sons of David who were born to him at Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+5:15">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:7">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+14:6">14:6</A>).
