            <P><B>HABOR</B><P> ha'-bor (chabhor; Habor, Habior; Isidor of Charax, Aburas (Abouras), Zosias, Aboras):
<P> 1. Its Position and Course:
<P> Is described in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+17:6">2&nbsp;Kings 17:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:11">18:11</A> (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:26</A>) as "the river of Gozan." It is the Arabic Khabur, and flows in a southerly direction from several sources in the mountains of Karaj Dagh (Mons Masius), which, in the 37th parallel, flanks the valley of the Tigris on the West. The river ultimately joins the Euphrates after receiving its chief tributary, the Jaghjagha Su (Mygdonius), at Circesium (Kirkisiyeh).
<P> 2. Etymologies of Habor:
<P> The meaning of its name is doubtful, but Delitzsch has suggested a Sumerian etymology, namely, habur, "the fish-waterway," or it may be connected with "mother Hubur'" a descriptive title of Tiamat (see MERODACH; RAHAB).
<P> 3. Historical References:
<P> Layard found several interesting Assyrian remains in the district, including man-headed bulls bearing the name of Muses-Ninip, possibly an Assyrian governor. Tiglath-pileser I (circa 1120 BC) boasts of having killed 10 mighty elephants in Haran and on the banks of the Habor; and Assur-nacir-apli (circa 880 BC), after conquering Harsit (Harrit, Harmis), subjugated the tract around piate sa nar Habur, "the mouths of the Habor." According to 2Ki and 1 Chronicles, Shalmaneser IV and Sargon transported the exiled Israelites thither. Philological considerations exclude the identification of the Chebar of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+13">Ezekiel 13</A>, etc., with the Habor.
