            <P><B>PRICK</B><P> prik:
<P> As a noun (= any slender pointed thing, a thorn, a sting) it translates two words:
<P> (1) sekh, a "thorn" or "prickle." Only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:55">Numbers 33:55</A>, "those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes," i.e. "shall be a source of painful trouble to you."
<P> (2) kentron "an iron goad" for urging on oxen and other beasts of burden:
<P> "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks" (the King James Version of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</A>, where the Revised Version (British and American) omits the whole phrase, following the best manuscripts, including Codices Sinaiticus, A, B, C, E; the King James Version of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</A>, where the Revised Version (British and American) has "goad," margin "Greek: `goads' "), i.e. to offer vain and perilous resistance. See GOAD. As a verb (= "to pierce with something sharply pointed," "to sting"), it occurs once in its literal sense: "a pricking brier" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+28:24">Ezekiel 28:24</A>); and twice in a figurative sense: "I was pricked in my heart" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+73:21">Psalms 73:21</A>); "They were pricked in their heart" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:37">Acts 2:37</A>, katanusso, Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) compungo; compare English word "compunction").
