<P> Codex Vaticanus Marrhon; Codex Alexandrinus Madon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+11:1">Joshua 11:1</A>); Codex Vaticanus Marmoth; Codex Alexandrinus Maron (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:19">Joshua 12:19</A>)): A royal city of the Canaanites named along with Hazor of Galilee. El-Medineh, "the city," on the heights West of the Sea of Galilee, with which it might possibly be identified, probably dates only from Moslem times. It seems likely that the common confusion of the Hebrew letter daleth ("d") for the Hebrew letter resh ("r") has occurred, and that we should read "Maron." The place may be then identified with Meiron, a village with ancient ruins and rock tombs at the foot of Jebel Jermuk, a little to the Northwest of Safed.
