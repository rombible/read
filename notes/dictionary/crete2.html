Cretans, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-11.html">Acts 2:11</a> ) were among those who were at Jerusalem at the great Pentecost. In [Acts 27:7-12 we have an account of Pauls shipwreck near this island; and it is evident from ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/titus/1-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/titus/1-5.html">Titus 1:5</a> ) that the apostle himself was here at no long interval of time before he wrote the letter. The Cretans were proverbial liars.
