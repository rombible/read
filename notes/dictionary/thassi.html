            <P><B>THASSI</B><P> thas'-i (Codex Venetus Thassei; Codex Vaticanus Thassis):
<P> The surname of Simon, the brother of Judas Maccabeus (1 Macc 2:3; Syriac "Tharsi"). It is uncertain what the name means, perhaps "director" or "guide," since Simon was "a man of counsel," or "the zealous."
