            <P><B>MEARAH</B><P> me-a'-ra (me`arah; omitted in the Septuagint):
<P> A town or district mentioned only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:4">Joshua 13:4</A>, as belonging to the Zidonians. The name as it stands means "cave." If that is correct it may be represented by the modern village Mogheiriyeh, "little cave," not far from Sidon. Perhaps, however, we should find in the word the name of a Sidonian city, with the preposition min, that has suffered change in transcription. Septuagint reads "from Gaza"; but Gaza is obviously too far to the South.
