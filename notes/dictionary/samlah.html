            <P><B>SAMLAH</B><P> sam'-la (samlah; Salama):
<P> One of the kings of Edom, of the city of Masrekah. He reigned before the Israelites had kings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:36,37">Genesis 36:36,37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:47,48">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:47,48</A>). The fact that the city is mentioned in connection with the name of the king suggests that Edom was a confederacy at this time and the chief city was the metropolis of the whole country.
