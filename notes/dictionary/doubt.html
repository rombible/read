            <P><B>DOUBT</B><P> dout:
<P> This word, found only a score of times in the Bible, translates nevertheless about half as many different Hebrew and Greek originals with a corresponding variety of meanings.
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+37:33">Genesis 37:33</A> "without doubt" is to be taken in the common sense of "certainly"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+12:2">Job 12:2</A> in the sarcastic sense of "indeed!" In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+5:12,16">Daniel 5:12,16</A>, it is used as a difficult problem or mystery to be explained, and these are the only cases of its employment in the Old Testament.
<P> In the New Testament it is about equally used to translate diaporeo, and diakrino, and their cognates. The first means "to be without resource," "utterly at a loss," "nonplussed"; and the second, "to judge diversely." For the first, see
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+13:22">John 13:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+2:12">Acts 2:12</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:24">Acts 5:24</A> the King James Version; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10:17">Acts 10:17</A> the King James Version;
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+25:20">Acts 25:20</A> the King James Version; and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+4:20">Galatians 4:20</A> the King James Version. For the second see
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+11:23">Mark 11:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</A>. The last-named is deserving of particular attention. "He that doubteth is condemned (the King James Version "damned") if he eat," means that in a case of uncertainty as to one's Christian liberty, it were better to err on the side of restraint. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+12:29">Luke 12:29</A> "to be of doubtful mind" (meteorizo, literally, "to suspend"; see Thayer, under the word), means "to be driven by gusts," or "to fluctuate in mid-air."
<P> Here, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+14:31">Matthew 14:31</A>, "doubt" does not indicate a lack of faith, but rather "a state of qualified faith":
<P> its weakness, but not its absence.
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+10:24" target="_blank">John 10:24</A> "doubt" translates airo psuchen, which literally means "to lift up the soul" or "to keep one in suspense"; so the Revised Version (British and American). See also <a href="disputation.html">DISPUTATION</a>.
