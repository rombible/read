            <P><B>WALK</B><P> wok (peripatein):
<P> Aside from its frequent occurrence in the usual sense, the word "walk" is used figuratively of conduct and of spiritual states. (1) Observance of laws or customs: "Thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</A>). (2) Of the spiritual life: "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1jo+1:7">1&nbsp;John 1:7</A>); "That like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</A>); "Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:16">Galatians 5:16</A>); "For we walk by faith, not by sight" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+5:7">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:7</A>).
