            <P><B>EVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</B><P> (Eua; Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek, Heua):
<P> "Eve" occurs twice in the New Testament and both references are in the Pauline writings. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+2:12-14">1&nbsp;Timothy 2:12-14</A> woman's place in teaching is the subject of discussion, and the writer declares that she is a learner and not a teacher, that she is to be in quietness and not to have dominion over a man. Paul elsewhere expressed this same idea (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:34,35">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:34,35</A>). Having stated his position in regard to woman's place, he used the Ge account of the relation of the first woman to man to substantiate his teaching. Paul used this account to illustrate woman's inferiority to man, and he undoubtedly accepted it at its face value without any question as to its historicity. He argued that woman is inferior in position, for "Adam was first formed, then Eve." She is inferior in character, for "Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression."
<P> See <a href="child-bearing.html" target="_blank">CHILD-BEARING</a>.
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+11:3">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:3</A>, Paul is urging loyalty to Christ, and he uses the temptation of Eve to illustrate the ease with which one is corrupted. Paul seems to have had no thought but that the account of the serpent's beguiling Eve should be taken literally.
