            <P><B>MARA</B><P> ma'-ra, mar'-a (marah, "bitter"):
<P> The term which Naomi applies to herself on her return from Moab to her native country (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+1:20">Ruth 1:20</A>). Changed beyond recognition, she creates astonishment among her former acquaintances, who ask, "Is this Naomi?" She replies, "Call me not Naomi" (i.e. "pleasant" or "sweet"), but "call me Mara" (i.e. "bitter"). In the light of her bitter experience, and her present pitiable plight, the old name has become peculiarly inappropriate.
