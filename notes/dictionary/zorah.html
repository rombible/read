            <P><B>ZORAH</B><P> zo'-ra (tsor`ah; Saraa):
<P> A city on the border of Dan, between Eshtaol and Ir-shemesh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:41">Joshua 19:41</A>); the birthplace of Samson (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+13:2,25">Judges 13:2,25</A>); near here too he was buried (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+16:31">Judges 16:31</A>); from here some Danites went to spy out the land (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+18:2,11">Judges 18:2,11</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:33">Joshua 15:33</A> it is, with Eshtaol, allotted to Judah, and after the captivity it was reinhabited by the "children of Judah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:29">Nehemiah 11:29</A>, the King James Version "Zareah"). It was one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:10</A>). It is probable that it is mentioned under the name Tsarkha along with Aialuna (Aijalon; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:10">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:10</A>) in the Tell el-Amarna Letters(No. 265, Petrie) as attacked by the Khabiri.
<P> It is the modern Sur`a, near the summit of a lofty hill on the north side of the Wady es-Surar (Vale of Sorek). The summit itself is occupied by the Mukam Nebi Samit, overhung by a lofty palm, and there are many remains of ancient tombs, cisterns, wine presses, etc., around. From here Eshu`a (Eshtaol), `Ain Shems (Beth-shemesh) and Tibnah (Timnah) are all visible. See PEF, III, 158, Sh XVII.
