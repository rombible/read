            <P><B>TADMOR</B><P> tad'-mor, tad'-mor (tadhmor):
<P> A city built by Solomon in the wilderness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+8:4">2&nbsp;Chronicles 8:4</A>), the Roman Palmyra. Tadmor is the native name and is found on inscriptions. It occurs also in the Kere of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+9:18">1&nbsp;Kings 9:18</A>, where the Kethibh or consonants read "Tamar" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+47:19">Ezekiel 47:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+48:28">48:28</A>). It is famous in Arabian as well as in Hebrew literature, and enters Roman history in connection with Zenobia and Longinus. The inscriptions, which belong for the most part to the latter period (266-73 AD), have been published by Dawkins and Wood and also by M. Waddington and the Duc de Luynes. Popular works on the subject are An Account of Palmyra and Zenobia by W. Wright, and The Last Days and Fall of Palmyra by W. Ware.
