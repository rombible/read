( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Exodus+30:34-36" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+30:34-36&amp;t=niv">Exodus 30:34-36</a> ) It was called <I>frank</I> because of the freeness with which, when burned, it gives forth its odor. It burns for a long time, with a steady flame. It is obtained by successive incisions in the bark of a tree called <I>Arbor thuris</I> . The first incision yields the purest and whitest resin, while the product of the after incisions is spotted with yellow, and loses its whiteness altogether as it becomes old. The Hebrews imported their frankincense from Arabia, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/60-6.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/60-6.html">Isaiah 60:6</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/6-20.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/6-20.html">Jeremiah 6:20</a> ) and more particularly from Saba; but it is remarkable that at present the Arabian libanum or olibanum is a very inferior kind, and that the finest frankincense imported into Turkey comes through Arabia from the islands of the Indian Archipelago. There can be little doubt that the tree which produces the Indian frankincense is the <I>Boswellia serrata</I> of Roxburgh, or <I>Boswellia thurifera</I> of Colebrooke, and bears some resemblance when young to the mountain ash. It grows to be forty feet high. </FONT></body></html>
