            <P><B>FILLET</B><P> fil'-et (chuT, chashuq):
<P> (1) Chut, from a root not used, meaning probably "to sew," therefore a string or a measuring rod or cord, and so a line, tape, thread, fillet. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+52:21">Jeremiah 52:21</A> translated "line" (the King James Version "fillet"), measuring 12 cubits long, encircling brass pillars standing 18 cubits high, part of the temple treasure plundered by the Chaldeans; and many other things "that were in the house of Yahweh, did the Chaldeans break in pieces." Translated "thread," used by Rahab, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+2:18">Joshua 2:18</A>, and "cord," "three fold .... is not quickly broken," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+4:12">Ecclesiastes 4:12</A>.
<P> (2) Chashuq, from a root meaning "to join" and therefore something joined or attached, and so a rail or rod between pillars, i.e. a fillet. The hangings of the court of the tabernacle were supported by brass pillars set in brass sockets, "The hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:10,11">Exodus 27:10,11</A>). The embroidered screen for the door of the Tent was supported by five pillars socketed in brass:
<P> "And he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+36:38">Exodus 36:38</A>). The pillars for the court and the gate of the court had fillets of silver (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+38:10">Exodus 38:10</A>). The verb is used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:17">Exodus 27:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+38:17">38:17</A>, "All the pillars of the court were filleted with silver."
