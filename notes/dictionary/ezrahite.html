            <P><B>EZRAHITE</B><P> ez'-ra-hit ('ezrachi; Asebon):
<P> Found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:31">1&nbsp;Kings 4:31</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+88">Psalms 88</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+89">Psalms 89</A>, titles; from which it appears that the word is a patronymic for Ethan and Heman. It may be derived from Zerah, instead of Ezrah, seeing that there were an Ethan and a Heman who were descendants of Zerah, head of a Judahite family (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:6">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:6</A>).
<P> There were also an Ethan and a Heman who were Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:17</A>).
