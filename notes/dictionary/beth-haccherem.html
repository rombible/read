            <P><B>BETH-HACCHEREM</B><P> beth-ha-ke'-rem, beth-hak'-e-rem (the King James Version Beth-haccerem; beth ha-kerem; Bethachcharma (see DB), "place of the vineyard"):
<P> A district (in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:14">Nehemiah 3:14</A>) ruled over by one, Malchijah; mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+6:1">Jeremiah 6:1</A> as a suitable signal station. From its association with Tekoa (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+6:1">Jeremiah 6:1</A>) and from the statement by Jerome that it was a village which he could see daily from Bethlehem, the Frank mountain (Herodium) has been suggested. It certainly would be a unique place for a beacon. More suitable is the fertile vineyard country around `Ain Karem (the "spring of the vineyard"). On the top of Jebel `Ali, above this village, are some remarkable cairns which, whatever their other uses, would appear to have been once beacons. `Ain Karem appears as Carem in the Septuagint (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:59">Joshua 15:59</A>).
