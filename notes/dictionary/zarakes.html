            <P><B>ZARAKES</B><P> zar'-a-kez (Codex Alexandrinus and Fritzsche, Zarakes; Codex Vaticanus and Swete, Zarios; Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) Zaracelem; the King James Version Zaraces):
<P> Occurs in the difficult passage, 1 Esdras 1:38, as the equivalent of Jehoahaz (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:34">2&nbsp;Kings 23:34</A>) and Joahaz (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+36:4">2&nbsp;Chronicles 36:4</A>), the brother of Eliakim (Jehoiakim or JOAKIM (which see)). According to 1 Esdras 1:38, Joakim apparently apprehended his brother, Zarakes, and brought him up out of Egypt, whither he must have been previously taken by Necoh, whereas 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles only state that Necoh took Joahaz (Zarakes) to Egypt.
