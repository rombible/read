            <P><B>DANGER</B><P> dan'-jer:
<P> Danger does not express a state of reality but a possibility. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</A>, however, and also the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</A> (the Revised Version (British and American)) "but is guilty of an eternal sin"the expression "danger" refers to a certainty, for the danger spoken of is in one case judgment which one brings upon himself, and in the other the committing of an unpardonable sin. Both are the necessary consequences of a man's conduct. The reason for translating the Greek (enochos, literally, "to be held in anything so one cannot escape") by "is in danger," instead of "guilty" or "liable," may be due to the translator's conception of these passages as a warning against such an act rather than as a statement of the judgment which stands pronounced over every man who commits the sin.
