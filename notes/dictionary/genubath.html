            <P><B>GENUBATH</B><P> ge-nu'-bath (genubhath, "theft"):
<P> Son of Hadad, the fugitive Edomite prince, born and brought up at the court of Egypt, whither Hadad had fled when David conquered Edom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+11:20">1&nbsp;Kings 11:20</A>). His mother was a sister of Tahpenes, queen of the Pharaoh who ruled Egypt at that time, and who belonged to the notoriously weak and uninfluential 21st dynasty.
