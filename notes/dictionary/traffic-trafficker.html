            <P><B>TRAFFIC, TRAFFICKER</B><P> traf'-ik, traf'-ik-er (kena`-an, micchar, cachar, rekhullah):
<P> (1) Kena`an = "Canaan," and, as the Canaanites were celebrated merchants, came to mean "merchant," and so "traffic" (see CANAAN). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+17:4">Ezekiel 17:4</A> refers to the great eagle who "cropped off the topmost of the young twigs (of cedar) thereof, and carried it unto a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants."
<P> (2) Micchar means "trade," and so "traffic"; comes from a root meaning "to travel round," e.g. as a peddler. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:15">1&nbsp;Kings 10:15</A> reads:
<P> "Besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants." This refers to the income of Solomon.
<P> (3) Cachar means "to go about," "occupy with," "trade," "traffic," "merchant," and so the business of the moving merchant or peddler. Joseph said to his brothers:
<P> "So will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+42:34">Genesis 42:34</A>). He evidently meant that they should have license to become, throughout Egypt, traveling traders.
<P> (4) Rekhullah, from a root meaning "to travel for trading," and so a peddled traffic, as in spices, etc. Ezekiel speaks against the prince of Tyre:
<P> "By thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches" (28:5); and against the king of Tyre: "in the unrighteousness of thy traffic," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+28:18">Ezekiel 28:18</A>).
<P> See MARKET; MERCHANDISE; SHIPS AND BOATS, II, 2, (2); TRADE.
