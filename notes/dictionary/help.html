            <P><B>HELP</B><P> With the sense of that which brings aid, support, or deliverance, "help" (noun and vb.) represents a large variety of words in Hebrew and Greek (noun 7, verb 16). A principal Hebrew word is `azar, "to help," with the corresponding nouns `ezer, `ezrah; a chief Greek word is boetheo (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+15:25">Matthew 15:25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:22,24">Mark 9:22,24</A>, etc.). True help is to be sought for in Yahweh, in whom, in the Old Testament, the believer is constantly exhorted to trust, with the renouncing of all other confidences (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+20:2">Psalms 20:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+33:20">33:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+42:5">42:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+46:1">46:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+115:9,10,11">115:9,10,11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+121:2">121:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+41:10,13,14">Isaiah 41:10,13,14</A>, etc.). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</A> it is said, "the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity," the verb here (sunantilambanetai) having the striking meaning of to "take hold along with one." In the story of Eden, Eve is spoken of as "a help meet" for Adam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:18,20">Genesis 2:18,20</A>). The idea in "meet" is not so much "suitability," though that is implied, as likeness, correspondence in nature (Vulgate, similem sibi). One like himself, as taken from him, the woman would be an aid and companion to the man in his tasks.
