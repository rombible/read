<P> (1) `akkabhish; compare Arabic `ankabut, English Versions of the Bible "spider"; Septuagint arachne (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+8:14">Job 8:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+59:5">Isaiah 59:5</A>);
<P> (2) semamith, "lizard," the King James Version "spider"; Septuagint kalabotes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:28">Proverbs 30:28</A>)):
<P> Semamith of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30:28">Proverbs 30:28</A> is probably the gecko, a kind of lizard, as Septuagint and the Revised Version (British and American) have it. See LIZARD.
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+8:14">Job 8:14</A> the spider's web is an emblem of frailty:
<P> "Whose confidence shall break in sunder, and whose trust is a spider's web." Frailty or futility seems to be indicated also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+59:5,6">Isaiah 59:5,6</A>: "They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web: .... Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works" "Spider's web" is in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+8:14">Job 8:14</A> both `akkabhish, "spider's house," while in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+59:5">Isaiah 59:5</A> it is qure `akkabhish, qur, according to BDB, being "thread" or "film."
