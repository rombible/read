The name is also derived from Eber, "beyond, on the other side," Abraham and his posterity being called Hebrews in order to express a distinction between the races east and west of the Euphrates. It may also be derived from <I>Heber</I> , one of the ancestors of Abraham. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/10-24.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/10-24.html">Genesis 10:24</a> ) The term Israelite was used by the Jews of themselves among themselves; the term Hebrew was the name by which they were known to foreigners. The latter was accepted by the Jews in their external relations; and after the general substitution of the word Jew, it still found a place in that marked and special feature of national contradistinction, the language. </FONT></body></html>
