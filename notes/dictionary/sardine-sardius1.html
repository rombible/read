( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/28-27.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/28-27.html">Exodus 28:27</a> ) The sard, which is probably the stone denoted by <I>odem</I> , is a superior variety of agate, sometimes called camelian, and has long been a favorite stone for the engravers art. Sardis differ in color: there is a bright-red variety, and perhaps the Hebrew <I>odem</I> from a root means "to be red," points to this kind. </FONT></body></html>
