            <P><B>SHEMAIAH</B><P> she-ma'-ya, she-mi'-a (shema`yah (in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:2">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+17:8">17:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+31:15">31:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+35:9">35:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+26:20">Jeremiah 26:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+29:24">29:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+36:12">36:12</A>, shema`yahu), "Jahveh hears"):
<P> The name is most frequently borne by priests, Levites and prophets.
<P> (1) Codex Vaticanus Sammaias; Codex Alexandrinus Samaias (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+12:5,7">2&nbsp;Chronicles 12:5,7</A>). A prophet who, together with Ahijah, protested against Rehoboam's contemplated war against the ten revolted tribes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+12:22-24">1&nbsp;Kings 12:22-24</A> = <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+11:2-4">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:2-4</A>). He declared that the rebellion had divine sanction. The second Greek account knows nothing of Ahijah in this connection and introduces Shemaiah at the gathering at Shechem where both Jeroboam and Rehoboam were present; it narrates that on this occasion Shemaiah (not Ahijah) rent his garment and gave ten parts to Jeroboam to signify the ten tribes over which he was to become king. (This version, however, is not taken very seriously, because of its numerous inconsistencies.) Shemaiah also prophesied at the invasion of Judah by Shishak (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+12:5-7">2&nbsp;Chronicles 12:5-7</A>). His message was to the effect that as the princes of Israel had humbled themselves, God's wrath against their idolatrous practices would not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+13:7">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13:7</A>). He is mentioned as the author of a history of Rehoboam (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+12:15">2&nbsp;Chronicles 12:15</A>).
<P> (2) Son of Shecaniah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:22">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:22</A>, Samaia), a descendant of Zerubbabel. This is also the name of one of the men who helped to repair the wall (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+3:29">Nehemiah 3:29</A>, Semeia (...) (compare Curtis, ICC, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+3:17-24">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:17-24</A>)).
<P> (3) A Simeonite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:37">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:37</A>, Codex Vaticanus Sumeon; Codex Alexandrinus Samaias), identical, perhaps, with the Shimei of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:26,27">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:26,27</A>.

<P> (7) Head of the Levitical Kohathite clan of Elizaphan in the time of David (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:8">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:8</A>, Codex Vaticanus Samaias; Codex Alexandrinus Samaia; Codex Sinaiticus Sameas; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:11</A>, Codex Vaticanus Samias; Codex Alexandrinus Semeias; Codex Sinaiticus Samai).
