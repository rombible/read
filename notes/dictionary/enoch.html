            <P><B>ENOCH</B><P> e'-nok (chanokh, "initiated"; Henoch):
<P> (1) The eldest son of Cain (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+4:17,18">Genesis 4:17,18</A>).
<P> (2) The son of Jared and father of Methuselah, seventh in descent from Adam in the line of Seth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:14">Jude 1:14</A>). He is said (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+5:23">Genesis 5:23</A>) to have lived 365 years, but the brief record of his life is comprised in the words, "Enoch walked with God:
<P> and he was not; for God took him" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+5:24">Genesis 5:24</A>). The expression "walked with God" denotes a devout life, lived in close communion with God, while the reference to his end has always been understood, as by the writer of He, to mean, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</A>).
