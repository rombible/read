<P> The Kadmonites are mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+15:19">Genesis 15:19</A> along with the Kenites and Kenizzites of Edom, and are doubtless the same as "the children of the east," whose wisdom was celebrated (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:30">1&nbsp;Kings 4:30</A>). qedhemah, "the East," was a son of Ishmael (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:15">Genesis 25:15</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:6">Genesis 25:6</A>). In an Egyptian story describing the adventures of a political refugee who fled from Egypt in the time of the XIIth Dynasty, it is said that he found a refuge in Canaan in the land of Kaduma or Kedem.
