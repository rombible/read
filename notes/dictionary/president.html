<P> Used only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+6:2-7">Daniel 6:2-7</A>. Probably a Persian derivative from sar, "head," and the Aramaic equivalent for Hebrew shoter. The meaning is self-evident and refers to the appointment of Daniel by Darius to be one of the three princes who had rule over the satraps of the empire.
