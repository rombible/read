            <P><B>ESHCOL (2)</B><P> esh'-kol ('eshkol; Pharagx botruos), "a cluster of grapes":
<P> The spies came to Hebron "and they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+13:23,14">Numbers 13:23,14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:9">32:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:24">Deuteronomy 1:24</A>). It was a valley near Hebron rich in vineyards. Fruitful vineyards are still the most characteristic feature of the environs of Hebron, especially on the North. No particular valley can be identified, though popular tradition favors the wide and fertile valley, near the traditional site of "Abraham's oak," a little to the West of the carriage road just before it enters the outskirts of Hebron.
