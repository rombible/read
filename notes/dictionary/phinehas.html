            <P><B>PHINEHAS</B><P> fin'-e-as, -az, fin'-e-has, -haz (pinechac, "mouth of brass"):
<P> (1) Son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+6:25">Exodus 6:25</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+6:4">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+7:5">Ezra 7:5</A>, where he is seen to be an ancestor of Ezra). He took a leading part in cleansing Israel from whoredom at Shittim. He there punished the brazen licentiousness of Zimri, prince of Sirecon, by slaying both him and the Midianite woman he had brought into camp (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:6-18">Numbers 25:6-18</A>). This incident is referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+106:30,31">Psalms 106:30,31</A> (compare 1 Macc 2:26,54; Sirach 45:23,24). As priest he accompanied the expedition sent by Moses against Midjan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+31:6">Numbers 31:6</A>). He was chief of the Korahite Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:20">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:20</A>), and succeeded his father as high priest. While he was in that office the civil war with Benjamin occurred, and it was he who delivered the oracle's decision to fight Benjamin (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:28">Judges 20:28</A>). His faithful services secured to his house the succession of the priesthood (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+25:11-13">Numbers 25:11-13</A>). He was sent as ambassador to inquire into the reported idolatry of Reuben, Gad and part of Manasseh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+22:13,30-32">Joshua 22:13,30-32</A>). According to Septuagint he was buried with his father in Ephraim on the hill Gibeah Phinehas (see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+24:33">Joshua 24:33</A>). His character was marked with strong moral indignation and fine integrity.
<P> (2) The younger son of Eli (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:3">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:3</A>; 2 Esdras 1:2, "Phinees").
<P> See HOPHNI AND PHINEHAS.
<P> (3) Father of a priest named Eleazar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:33">Ezra 8:33</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:2">Ezra 8:2</A>; 1 Esdras 8:63, "Phinees").
