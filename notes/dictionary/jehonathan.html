            <P><B>JEHONATHAN</B><P> je-hon'-a-than (yehonathan, "Yahweh has given"):
<P> The name is the same as Jonathan: the Hebrew has the two forms for the same person sometimes; sometimes only one is found. See JONATHAN. The form "Jehonathan" occurs as follows in English Versions of the Bible:
<P> (1) A Levite who took part in teaching the Torah in the cities of Judah under Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+17:8">2&nbsp;Chronicles 17:8</A> English Versions of the Bible and Hebrew).
<P> (2) Head of the priestly family of Shemaiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:18">Nehemiah 12:18</A> English Versions of the Bible and Hebrew).
<P> (3) the King James Version and Hebrew in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:25">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:25</A>; see JONATHAN, (7).
