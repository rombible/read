<P> Variously described as "the greatest man among the Anakim" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+14:15">Joshua 14:15</A>), "the father of Anak" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:13">Joshua 15:13</A>), "the father of Anok" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:11">Joshua 21:11</A> margin). Thus he seems to have been regarded as the ancestor of the Anakim, and as the most famous hero of that race. He was the reputed founder of the city called after him, on the site of which Hebron was built (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:11">Joshua 21:11</A>).
