            <P><B>EGLON (1)</B><P> eg'-lon (`eghlon, "circle"):
<P> A king of Moab in the period of the Judges who, in alliance with Ammon and Amalek, overcame Israel and made Jericho his capital, presumably driven across the Jordan by the turmoil in his own kingdom which at that time was probably being used as a battle ground by Edom and the desert tribes (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+36:35">Genesis 36:35</A>). After 18 years of servitude the children of Israel were delivered by Ehud the Benjamite, who like so many other Benjamites (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+20:16">Judges 20:16</A>) was left-handed. Under the pretext of carrying a present to the tyrant, he secured a private interview and assassinated him with a two-edged sword which he had carried concealed on his right side (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:19-22">Judges 3:19-22</A>). Ehud made his escape, rallied the children of Israel about him and returned to conquer the Moabites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+3:30">Judges 3:30</A>).
