<P> "The house of Ashbea," a family of linen-workers mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:21">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:21</A>. We might render beth 'ashbea` as their dwelling-place; nothing is known of such a place nor is this house of weavers referred to in any other place.
