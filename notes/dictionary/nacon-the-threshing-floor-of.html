            <P><B>NACON, THE THRESHING FLOOR OF</B><P> na'-kon, (nakhon; the King James Version Nachon):
<P> The place where Uzzah was smitten for putting forth his hand to steady the ark, hence, called afterward "Perezuzzah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:8">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:8</A>); in the parallel passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+13:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:9</A>) we have kidhon, and in Josephus (Ant., VII, iv, 2) Cheidon. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+23:23">1&nbsp;Samuel 23:23</A> the word nakhon occurs, and is translated "of a certainty," margin "with the certainty" or "to a set place"; also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+26:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 26:4</A> it is translated "of a certainty," margin "to a set place." It is uncertain whether in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+6:6">1&nbsp;Samuel 6:6</A> it is a place-name at all; and no successful attempt has been made to identify either Nacon or Chidon; possibly they are both personal names.
