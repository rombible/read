            <P><B>MOWING; MOWN GRASS</B><P> mo'-ing, (gez, "a shearing," "cut grass"):
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+72:6">Psalms 72:6</A> the good king's rule is said to be "like rain upon the mown grass," to start the new growth (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:4">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+6:3">Hosea 6:3</A>). "The king's mowings" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+7:1">Amos 7:1</A>) were the portion of the spring herbage taken as tribute by the kings of Israel to feed their horses (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+8:15">1&nbsp;Samuel 8:15</A>; 18:5). "After the king's mowings" would denote the time when everybody else might turn to reap their greenstuffs (BTP, II, 109). The term "mower" (qatsar, "to dock off," "shorten") in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+129:7">Psalms 129:7</A> the King James Version is rendered "reaper" in the Revised Version (British and American), and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+5:4">James 5:4</A> the Revised Version (British and American) has "mow" for amao (the King James Version "reap").
