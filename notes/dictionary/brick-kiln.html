            <P><B>BRICK-KILN</B><P> brik'-kil, -kiln (malben):
<P> The Hebrew word is better translated by "brickmould." In Syria the brickmould is still called milben. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+43:9">Jeremiah 43:9</A> the American Standard Revised Version rendering is "brickwork" and the American Revised Version, margin "pavement." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+12:31">2&nbsp;Samuel 12:31</A> becomes much clearer if the American Revised Version, margin is incorporated. Being put to work at the brickmould was considered the task of those taken as slaves. The ancestors of the new taskmasters had themselves been put to similar toil.
