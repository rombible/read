            <P><B>AMMI</B><P> am'-i (`ammi, "my people"):
<P> A symbolic name given to Israel by Hosea (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+2:1">Hosea 2:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+2:3">2:3</A> in Hebrew text), descriptive of Israel in the state of restoration, and in contrast to sinful and rejected Israel, represented by Hosea's son, who was called Lo-ammi, "not my people," when born to the prophet (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+1:9,10">Hosea 1:9,10</A>). This restoration to the Divine favor is more fully described in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+2:21,23">Hosea 2:21,23</A> in words quoted by Paul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:25,26">Romans 9:25,26</A>). The use of such figurative and descriptive names is frequent in the Old Testament; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+62:4,12">Isaiah 62:4,12</A>.
