            <P><B>TRANSFIGURATION</B><P> trans-fig-o-ra'-shun (metamorphoomai, "to be transformed"):
<P> Used only with reference to the transfiguration of Christ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:2">Mark 9:2</A>) and the change wrought in the Christian personality through fellowship with Christ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+3:18">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:18</A>).
 (1) About midway of His active ministry Jesus, accompanied by Peter, James and John, withdrew to a high mountain apart (probably Mt. Hermon; see next article) for prayer. While praying Jesus was "transfigured," "his face did shine as the sun," "and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them." It was night and it was cold. The disciples were drowsy and at first but dimly conscious of the wonder in progress before their eyes. From the brightness came the sound of voices. Jesus was talking with Moses and Elijah, the subject of the discourse, as the disciples probably learned later, being of the decease (exodus) which Jesus was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. As the disciples came to themselves, the figures of Moses and Elijah seemed to withdraw, whereupon Peter impetuously demanded tents to be set up for Jesus and His heavenly visitants that the stay might be prolonged and, if possible, made permanent. Just then a cloud swept over them, and out of the cloud a voice came, saying, "This is my beloved Son:
<P> hear ye him." In awe the disciples prostrated themselves and in silence waited. Suddenly, lifting up their eyes they saw no one, save Jesus only (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:1-13">Matthew 17:1-13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:2-13">Mark 9:2-13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+9:28-36">Luke 9:28-36</A>).
<P> Such is the simple record. What is its significance? The Scripture narrative offers no explanation, and indeed the event is afterward referred to only in the most general way by Peter (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+1:16-18">2&nbsp;Peter 1:16-18</A>) and, perhaps, by John (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:14">John 1:14</A>). That it marked a crisis in the career of Jesus there can be no doubt. From this time He walked consciously under the shadow of the cross. A strict silence on the subject was enjoined upon the three witnesses of His transfiguration until after "the Son of man should have risen again from the dead." This means that, as not before, Jesus was made to realize the sacrificial character of His mission; was made to know for a certainty that death, soon and cruel, was to be His portion; was made to know also that His mission as the fulfillment of Law (Moses) and prophecy (Elijah) was not to be frustrated by death. In His heart now would sound forever the Father's approval, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The scene, therefore, wrought out in Jesus a new fervor, a new boldness, a new confidence of ultimate victory which, as a source of holy joy, enabled Him to endure the cross and to despise the shame (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</A>). In the disciples the scene must have wrought a new faith in the heavensent leadership of Jesus. In the dark days which were soon to come upon them the memory of the brightness of that unforgettable night would be a stay and strength. There might be opposition, but there could be no permanent defeat of one whose work was ratified by Moses, by Elijah, by God Himself. Indeed, was not the presence of Moses and Elijah a pledge of immortality for all? How in the face of such evidence, real to them, however it might be to others, could they ever again doubt the triumph of life and of Him who was the Lord of life? The abiding lesson of the Transfiguration is that of the reality of the unseen world, of its nearness to us, and of the comforting and inspiring fact that "spirit with spirit may meet."
<P> The transfigured appearance of Jesus may have owed something to the moonlight on the snow and to the drowsiness of the disciples; but no one who has ever seen the face of a saint fresh from communion with God, as in the case of Moses (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+34:29-35">Exodus 34:29-35</A>) and of Stephen (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+6:15">Acts 6:15</A>), will have any difficulty in believing that the figure of Jesus was irradiated with a "light that never was on sea or land." See Comms. and Lives of Christ; also a suggestive treatment in Westcott's Introduction to the Study of the Gospels.
<P> (2) The transfiguration of Christians is accomplished by the renewing of the mind whereby, in utter abandonment to the will of God, the disciple displays the mind of Christ (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</A>); and by that intimate fellowship with God, through which, as with unveiled face he beholds the glory of the Lord, he is "transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+3:18">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:18</A>).
