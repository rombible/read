            <P><B>LANTERN</B><P> lan'-tern (phanos, phaino, "to give light"):
<P> Lanterns were carried by the mob which arrested Jesus in Gethsemane (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+18:3">John 18:3</A>, probably better "torches"). The word "lantern" in the time of early versions had a much wider significance than now. The Romans, however, had lanterns in the times of Christ, made by use of translucent skins, bladders, or thin plates of horn.
