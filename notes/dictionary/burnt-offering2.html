The meaning of the whole burnt offering was that which is the original idea of all sacrifice, the offering by the sacrificer of himself, soul and body, to God--the submission of his will to the will of the Lord. The ceremonies of the burnt offering are given in detail in the book of Leviticus. [<B><a href="sacrifice.html" target="_blank" url="sacrifice.html">SACRIFICE</a></B>] </FONT></body></html>
