            <P><B>NAPHTUHIM</B><P> naf-tu'-him (naphtuchim; Septuagint Nephthaleim):
<P> A son of Mizraim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:13">Genesis 10:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:11</A>); but, according to most modern authorities, a district or a dependency of Egypt. Among the many efforts at identification the following deserve notice: Naphtuhim equals (1) Nephthys (Nephthus) in the Northeast of Egypt; (2) Na-ptah, i.e. the people of Ptah, the dwellers in the neighborhood of Memphis; (3) Nathu (according to Herodotus, Natho), which occurs in Assurbanipal's Annals as the name of a part of Lower Egypt; (4) Erman (ZATW, X, 118), by the change of a letter, reads Petemhim, which signifies "The Northland"; (5) Spiegelberg sees in the word an old designation of the Delta, and would therefore render the name, "the people of the Delta" (compare Johns, HDB; Skinner and Holzinger on Genesis).
