            <P><B>JABBOK</B><P> jab'-ok (yabboq, "luxuriant river"):
<P> A stream in Eastern Palestine first named in the history of Jacob, as crossed by the patriarch on his return from Paddan-aram, after leaving Mahanaim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+32:22">Genesis 32:22</A>). On the bank of this river he had his strange conflict with an unknown antagonist. The Jabbok was the northern boundary of the territory of Sihon the Amorite (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:24">Numbers 21:24</A>). It is also named as the border of Ammon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:16">Deuteronomy 3:16</A>). It is now called Nahr ez-Zerqa, "river of blue," referring to the clear blue color of its water. It rises near to `Amman--Rabbath Ammon--and makes a wide circuit, flowing first to the East, then to the Northwest, until it is joined by the stream from Wady Jerash, at which point it turns westward, and flows, with many windings, to the Jordan, the confluence being just North of ed-Damiyeh. It drains a wider area than any other stream East of the Jordan, except the Yarmuk. The bed of the river is in a deep gorge with steep, and in many places precipitous, banks. It is a great cleft, cutting the land of Gilead in two. It is lined along its course by a luxuriant growth of oleander which, in season, lights up the valley with brilliant color. The length of the stream, taking no account of its innumerable windings, is about 60 miles. The mouth of the river has changed its position from time to time. In the lower reaches the vegetation is tropical. The river is fordable at many points, save when in full flood. The particular ford referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+32">Genesis 32</A> cannot now be identified.
