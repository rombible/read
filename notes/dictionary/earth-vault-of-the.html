            <P><B>EARTH, VAULT, OF THE</B><P> volt:
<P> In one passage God is said to have "founded his vault ('aghuddah) upon the earth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+9:6">Amos 9:6</A>). It is not quite certain whether this dome or vault refers to the earth itself, or to the heavens arched above it.
<P> The latter is the usual interpretation, but in either case the reference is rather to the strength of the structure than to its form; the word implying something that is firmly bound together and hence, an arch or dome because of its stability.
<P> See also <a href="astronomy-ii.html" target="_blank">ASTRONOMY</a>, sec. III, 2.
