            <P><B>STAY</B><P> sta:
<P> Is derived from two distinct forms. From one derivation it has the meaning "to stand" and so "to continue in one place" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+8:10">Genesis 8:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:23,28">Leviticus 13:23,28</A>, etc.), "to forbear to act" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+1:13">Ruth 1:13</A>), "to rest," "to be trustful" (King James Version, the English Revised Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:20">Isaiah 10:20</A>; see below). Transitively it means "to cause to stay," "to hinder" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+4:35">Daniel 4:35</A>, etc.), and "stay" as a noun means "cessation of progress"' (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:5,37">Leviticus 13:5,37</A>), "sojourn." From the second derivation the verb means "to support" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+17:12">Exodus 17:12</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+22:35">1&nbsp;Kings 22:35</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+2:5">Song of Solomon 2:5</A>), while the noun means "a support" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+10:19">1&nbsp;Kings 10:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:1">Isaiah 3:1</A>, etc.). the American Standard Revised Version has judged obsolete "stay on" in the sense "trust in," and for "stay" has substituted "lean" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:20">Isaiah 10:20</A> and "rely" in 30:12; 31:1; 50:10, although "stay themselves upon" (= "support themselves by") has been kept in 48:2. Otherwise the Revised Version (British and American) has made few alterations. But such as have been made ("tarry ye" for "stay yourselves" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+29:9">Isaiah 29:9</A> and the American Standard Revised Version "restrain" for "stay" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+37:4">Job 37:4</A>) could have been carried farther with advantage.
