            <P><B>MASSA</B><P> mas'-a (massa', "burden"):
<P> Descendant of Abraham through Ishmael (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:14">Genesis 25:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+1:30">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:30</A>). His people may be the Masani of Ptolemy, having Eastern Arabia near Babylon as their habitat. The marginal reading of the heading to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+31">Proverbs 31</A> mentions Lemuel as king of Massa. If that reading is accepted, it would seem that a tribe and probably a place were named from Ishmael's descendant. The reading is doubtful, however, for where the phrase recurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+30">Proverbs 30</A> (Revised Version (British and American)) it appears to be a gloss.
