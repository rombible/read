The Ephraimites, it would appear, in their dialect substituted for <I>sh</I> the simple sound <I>s</I> ; and the Gileadites, regarding every one who failed to pronounce <I>sh</I> as an Ephraimite and therefore an enemy, put him to death accordingly. In this way there fell 42,000 Ephraimites. There is no mystery in this particular word. Any word beginning with the sound <I>sh</I> would have answered equally well as a test. </FONT></body></html>
