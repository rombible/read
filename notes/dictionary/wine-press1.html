The two vats are mentioned together only in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/joel/3-13.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/joel/3-13.html">Joel 3:13</a> ) "The press is full: the fats overflow" --the upper vat being full of fruit, the lower one overflowing with the must. [<B><a href="wine.html" target="_blank" url="wine.html">WINE</a></B>] The two vats were usually hewn out of the solid rock.
