            <P><B>ASHPENAZ</B><P> ash'-pe-naz ('ashpenaz):
<P> The master of the eunuchs of Nebuchadnezzar was an officer into whose hands the king entrusted those of the children of Israel, and of the princes, and of the seed of the king of Judah, whom he had carried captive to Babylon, that they might be taught the learning and tongue of the Chaldeans in order to serve in the king's palace. He is mentioned by name in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+1:3">Daniel 1:3</A> only. It used to be supposed that the name was Persian; but it now seems more probable that it is Babylonian. We would suggest Ashipu-Anu- Izzu, "the Aship-priest of Ann is mighty," as a possible form of the original.
