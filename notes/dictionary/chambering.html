            <P><B>CHAMBERING</B><P> cham'-ber-ing:
<P> Illicit intercourse; the rendering in English Versions of the Bible since Tyndale of koitias (literally "beds," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</A>). The Greek usage is paralleled in classic authors and the Septuagint; like the English participle, it denotes repeated or habitual acts. The word is not recorded elsewhere in English literature as verb or participle in this sense; in Othello, iii, 3, a chamberer is an intriguer, male wanton, in Byron, Werner, IV, 1, 404, a gallant or carpet knight, and in Chaucer, Clerk's Tale, 766, a concubine.
