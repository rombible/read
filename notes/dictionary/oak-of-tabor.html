            <P><B>OAK OF TABOR</B><P> ('elon tabhor):
<P> Thus the Revised Version (British and American) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+10:3">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:3</A> for the King James Version "plain of Tabor" (the Revised Version margin "terebinth"). Tabor was famous for its groves of oak, but what "oak" is meant here is not known. Ewald thinks that "Tabor" is a different pronunciation for "Deborah," and connects with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+35:8">Genesis 35:8</A>; but this is not likely.
<P> See OAK, 3.
