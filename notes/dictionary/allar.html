            <P><B>ALLAR</B><P> al'-ar (the King James Version, Aalar; Aalar):

HDB identifies with Immer of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:59">Ezra 2:59</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:61">Nehemiah 7:61</A> (which see), but this is not at all certain.
