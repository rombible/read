            <P><B>LO-DEBAR</B><P> lo'-de-bar, lo-de'-bar (lo dhebhar):
<P> A place in Gilead where dwelt Machir, son of Ammiel, who sheltered Mephibosheth, son of Saul, after that monarch's death (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+9:4">2&nbsp;Samuel 9:4</A>), until he was sent for by David. This same Machir met David with supplies when he fled to Gilead from Absalom (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+17:27">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:27</A>). Possibly it is the same place as Lidebir in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:26">Joshua 13:26</A> (Revised Version margin). No certain identification is possible; but Schumacher (Northern 'Ajlun, 101) found a site with the name Ibdar about 6 1/2 miles East of Umm Qeis, North of the great aqueduct, which may possibly represent the ancient city. Lidebir, at least, seems to be placed on the northern boundary of Gilead. The modern village stands on the southern shoulder of Wady Samar. There is a good spring to the East, a little lower down, while ancient remains are found in the neighborhood.
