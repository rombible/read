The chief MSS. and versions exhibit the name as <B><a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/smiths-bible-dictionary/magadan.html" target="_blank" url="magadan.html">MAGADAN</a></B>, as in the Revised Version. Into the limits of Magadan Christ came by boat, over the Lake of Gennesareth after his miracle of feeding the four thousand on the Mountain of the eastern side, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/15-39.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/15-39.html">Matthew 15:39</a> ) and from thence he returned in the same boat to the opposite shore. In the parallel narrative of St. Mark, ch. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/8-10.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/8-10.html">Mark 8:10</a> ) we find the "parts of Dalmanutha," on the western edge of the Lake of Gennesareth. The Magdala, which conferred her name on "Mary the Magdalene one of the numerous migdols, i.e. towers, which stood in Palestine, was probably the place of that name which is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud as near Tiberias, and this again is as probably the modern <I>el-Mejdel</I> , a miserable little Muslim village, of twenty huts on the waters edge at the southeast corner of the plain of Gennesareth. It is now the only inhabited place on this plain. </FONT></body></html>
