            <P><B>GEDEROTHAIM</B><P> ged-e-ro-tha'-im (gedherathayim, "place of enclosures"):
<P> Stands as the 15th in a list which professes to give only the names of 14 cities in the Judean Shephelah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:36">Joshua 15:36</A>). the King James Version margin suggests that we might read "or" for "and" after Gederah, but this is impossible. Septuagint reads, "and its cattle shelters." Probably, however, the name has arisen by dittography from the preceding GEDERAH (which see).
