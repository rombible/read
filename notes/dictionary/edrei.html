<P> (1) One of the cities of Og, not far from Ashtaroth, where the power of his kingdom received its deathblow from the invading Israelites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:4">Joshua 12:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:33">Numbers 21:33</A>, etc.). It seems to mark the western limit of Bashan as against Salecah on the East (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+3:10">Deuteronomy 3:10</A>). It was given to Machir, son of Manasseh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:31">Joshua 13:31</A>). Eusebius, Onomasticon places it 24 Roman miles from Bostra. The most probable identification is with Der`ah, a town of between 4,000 and 5,000 inhabitants, on the southern lip of Wady Zeideh, about 29 miles as the crow flies East of the Sea of Galilee. It is the center of an exceedingly fruitful district. The accumulated rubbish in the town covers many remains of antiquity. It is, however, chiefly remarkable for the extraordinary subterranean city, as yet only partially explored, cut in the rock under the town. This is certainly very ancient, and was doubtless used by the inhabitants as a refuge in times of stress and peril. For a description see Schumacher, Across the Jordan, 121.
<P> (2) A place not identified, between Kedesh and En-hazor (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:37">Joshua 19:37</A>).
