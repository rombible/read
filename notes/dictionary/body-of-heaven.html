            <P><B>BODY OF HEAVEN</B><P> The King James Version translates the Hebrew idiom, etsem ha-shamayim, by "the body of heaven" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+24:10">Exodus 24:10</A>). A more correct rendering is given in the Revised Version (British and American), "the very heaven," taking the word `etsem in its idiomatic use as an intensive, which is derived from its literal meaning, "bone," as "strength," "substance," and then as "self" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+21:23">Job 21:23</A>); the substance of the blue, unclouded sky, hence, the clear sky itself.
