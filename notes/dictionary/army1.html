It does not appear that the system established by David was maintained by the kings of Judah; but in Israel the proximity of the hostile kingdom of Syria necessitated the maintenance of a standing army. The maintenance and equipment of the soldiers at the public expense dated from the establishment of a standing army. It is doubtful whether the soldier ever received pay even under the kings. II. <B><a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/smiths-bible-dictionary/roman-empire.html" target="_blank" url="roman-empire.html">ROMAN</a></B> ARMY.--The Roman army was divided into legions, the number of which varied considerably (from 3000 to 6000), each under six tribuni ("chief captains,") ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-31.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-31.html">Acts 21:31</a> ) who commanded by turns. The legion was subdivided into ten cohorts ("band,") ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-1.html">Acts 10:1</a> ) the cohort into three maniples, and the maniple into two centuries, containing originally 100 men, as the name implies, but subsequently from 50 to 100 men, according to the strength of the legion. There were thus 60 centuries in a legion, each under the command of a centurion. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-1.html">Acts 10:1</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-22.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-22.html">Acts 10:22</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/8-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/8-5.html">Matthew 8:5</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-54.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-54.html">27:54</a> ) In addition to the legionary cohorts, independent cohorts of volunteers served under the Roman standards. One of these cohorts was named the Italian, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/10-1.html">Acts 10:1</a> ) as consisting of volunteers from Italy. The headquarters of the Roman forces in Judea were at Caesarea. </FONT></body></html>
