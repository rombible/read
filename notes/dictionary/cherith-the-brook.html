            <P><B>CHERITH, THE BROOK</B><P> ke'-rith (nachal kerith; Cheimarrhous Chorrhath):
<P> The place where Elijah hid and was miraculously fed, after announcing the drought to Ahab (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+17:3">1&nbsp;Kings 17:3</A>). It is described as being "before," that is "east," of Jordan. It cannot therefore be identified with Wady el-Kelt, to the West of Jericho. The retreat must be sought in some recess of the Gilead uplands with which doubtless Elijah had been familiar in his earlier days.
