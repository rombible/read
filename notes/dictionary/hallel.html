            <P><B>HALLEL</B><P> ha-lal', hal'-el:
<P> In the fifth book of the Psalms (107-50) there are several groups of Hallelujah Psalms: 104-106; 111-113; 115-117; 135; 146-150. In the worship of the synagogue Psalms 135-136 and 146-150 were used in the daily morning service. Psalms 113-118 were called the "Egyp Hallel," and were sung at the feasts of the Passover, Pentecost, Tabernacles and Dedication. At the Passover, Psalms 113 and 114 (according to the school of Shammai only <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+113">Psalms 113</A>) were sung before the feast, and Psalms 115-118 after drinking the last cup. The song used by our Lord and the disciples on the night of the betrayal (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+26:30">Matthew 26:30</A>), just before the departure for the Mount of Olives, probably included Psalms 115-118.
