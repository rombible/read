            <P><B>FLOURISH</B><P> flur'-ish (parach, tsuts; anathallo):
<P> The translation of parach, "to break forth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+72:7">Psalms 72:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+92:12,13">92:12,13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+14:11">Proverbs 14:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+66:14">Isaiah 66:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+6:11">Song of Solomon 6:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+7:12">7:12</A>; the Revised Version (British and American) "budded"); of tsuts "to bloom" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+72:16">Psalms 72:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+90:6">90:6</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+92:7">92:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+103:15">103:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+132:18">132:18</A>); ra`anan, "green," "fresh," is translated "flourishing" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+92:14">Psalms 92:14</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) "green," and ra`anan, Aramaic in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+4:4">Daniel 4:4</A>; nubh, "to sprout" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+9:17">Zechariah 9:17</A>, the King James Version "cheerful").
<P> In an interesting passage (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ec+12:5">Ecclesiastes 12:5</A> the King James Version), the Hiphil future of na'ats, meaning properly "to pierce or strike," hence, to slight or reject, is translated "flourish"; it is said of the old man "The almond tree shall flourish," the Revised Version (British and American) "blossom" (so Ewald, Delitzsch, etc.); na'ats has nowhere else this meaning; it is frequently rendered "contemn;" "despise," etc. Other renderings are, "shall cause loathing" (Gesenius, Knobel, etc.), "shall be despised," i.e. the hoary head; "The almond tree shall shake off its flowers," the silvery hairs falling like the fading white flowers of the almond tree; by others it is taken to indicate "sleeplessness," the name of the almond tree (shaqedh) meaning the watcher or early riser (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+1:11">Jeremiah 1:11</A>, "a rod of an almond-tree," literally, "a wakeful (or early) tree"), the almond being the first of the trees to wake from the sleep of winter.
<P> See ALMOND.
<P> "Flourish" appears once only in the New Testament, in the King James Version, as translation of anathallo, "to put forth anew," or "to make put forth anew" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:10">Philippians 4:10</A>):
<P> "Your care for me hath flourished again," the Revised Version (British and American) "Ye have revived your thought for me."
