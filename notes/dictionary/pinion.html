            <P><B>PINION</B><P> pin'-yun ('ebher, 'ebhrah):
<P> the Revised Version (British and American) has translated these Hebrew words uniformly by "pinion," where the King James Version uses either "wing" or "feathers," with which words they stand in parallelism in all passages. The shorter Hebrew word is found only once, in Yahweh's parable to Ezekiel: "A great eagle with great wings and long pinions (the King James Version "longwinged"), full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+17:3">Ezekiel 17:3</A>). The feminine form ('ebhrah) is used of the wings of the dove (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+68:13">Psalms 68:13</A>), of the ostrich (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:13">Job 39:13</A>) and of the eagle (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:11">Deuteronomy 32:11</A>). Once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+91:4">Psalms 91:4</A>) it stands in a figurative expression for the protective care of Yahweh, which is bestowed on those that trust in Him.
