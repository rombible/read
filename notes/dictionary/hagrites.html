            <P><B>HAGRITES</B><P> hag'-rits (haghri'im):
<P> An Arab tribe, or confederation of tribes (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:10,19,20">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:10,19,20</A> the King James Version "Hagarites"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:31">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:31</A> the King James Version "Hagerite"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+83:6">Psalms 83:6</A> "Hagarenes"), against which the Reubenites fought in the days of Saul. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:12-18">Genesis 25:12-18</A> are recorded the descendants, "generations," of Ishmael, "whom Hagar the Egyptian Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham." Two, and possibly three, of these tribes, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah (25:15), appear to be identical with the 3 tribes whom the Reubenites and the other Israelite tribes East of the Jordan conquered and dispossessed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5</A>). The correspondence of names in Ge and 1Ch leaves little doubt that "Hagrite" is a generic term roughly synonymous with "Ishmaelite," designating the irregular and shifting line of desert tribes stretching along the East and South of Palestine. Those "East of Gilead," "Jetur, Naphish and Nodah," were overcome by Reuben: "The Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them. .... And they took away their cattle .... they dwelt in their stead until the captivity" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+5:20-22">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:20-22</A>).
<P> These along with other Arab tribes are mentioned in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III (745-727 BC). Jetur gave his name to the Itureans of Roman times, who were famed soldiers dwelling in Anti-Libanus. Compare Curtis, Commentary on Chronicles; Skinner, "Gen," ICC, in the place cited.
