            <P><B>ADMIRATION</B><P> ad-mi-ra'-shun (thauma, "a marvel" or "wonder"; thaumazo, "to wonder"):
<P> A term thrice used in the King James Version in the New Testament, to express a wonder that includes approval, high esteem; replaced in the Revised Version (British and American) by three renderings better suited to convey the various kinds of surprise, wonder, admiration, expressed, by this fertile word: namely, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+1:10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:10</A>, "to be admired," reads in the Revised Version (British and American) "to be marveled at"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:16">Jude 1:16</A> "having men's persons in admiration" is rendered "showing respect of persons"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</A> "wondered with great admiration" is replaced by "with a great wonder." The Greek original is used frequently in the New Testament, especially in the Gospels, to express marvel and wonder at the supernatural works of Jesus.
<P> Dwight M. Pratt
