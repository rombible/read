            <P><B>SCAB, SCABBED</B><P> skab, skab'-ed, skabd (yallepheth, micpachath, cappachath, verb sippach; semasia, leichen):
<P> These are generic terms for any skin disease in which there are patches of hard crusts on the surface. The commonest of these are the forms now named eczema, herpes and, perhaps, psoriasis, all of which are common in Bible lands. Milder cases in which the disease was localized and in small patches (the semasia of the Septuagint) did not render the bearer unclean, and they were to be distinguished by the priest (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:2,6">Leviticus 13:2,6</A>) from the more virulent and spreading eruptions which (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:7">Leviticus 13:7</A>) were regarded as causes of ceremonial uncleanness. These severer forms are the leichen of Septuagint mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:20">Leviticus 21:20</A>, which disqualified any son of Aaron from serving as a priest, and when affecting an animal rendered it unfit to be offered as a burnt offering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+22:22">Leviticus 22:22</A>). Hippocrates speaks of these cases as obstinate and persistent, and Galen believed that they might degenerate into leprosy; hence, the terms in which Aeschylus speaks of it (Choephori 281). Celsus, however, recognized that leichen was a papular eruption, not a true scab. The name yallepheth seems to have been given to it on account of the firmness of attachment of the scabs, while the term micpachath refers to its tendency to spread and cover the surface. A cognate word in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+13:18">Ezekiel 13:18</A> is the name of a large Tallith or prayer veil used by the false prophetesses in Israel (translated "kerchief"). Scabs were especially disfiguring on the head, and this infliction was threatened as a punishment on the daughters of Zion for their wanton haughtiness (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:17">Isaiah 3:17</A>). In Middle English, "scab" is used for itch or mange, and as a term of opprobrium, as in Greene, Bacon and Bungay, 35, 1591.
