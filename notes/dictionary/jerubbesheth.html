            <P><B>JERUBBESHETH</B><P> jer-ub-be'-sheth, je-rub'-e-sheth (yerubbesheth, see JERUBBAAL, for meaning):
<P> It is found once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:21">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:21</A>) for JERUBBAAL.
<P> The word bosheth, "shameful thing," was substituted by later editors of the text for ba`al, "lord," in the text of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+3:24">Jeremiah 3:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+9:10">Hosea 9:10</A>; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+2:8">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:8</A>, etc., we find Ish-bosheth = Eshbaal (Ishbaal) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+8:33">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:39">9:39</A>. The reason for this was reluctant to pronounce the word Ba`al, which had by their time been associated with Canaanitic forms of worship. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+11:21">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:21</A> Septuagint, Lucian, has "Jeroboal," which Septuagint, Codex Vaticanus, has corrupted to "Jeroboam." Compare MERIB-BAAL; MEPHIBOSHETH; and see Ginsburg, New Massoretico-Critical Text of the Hebrew Bible, Intro, 400. For a New Testament case compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:4">Romans 11:4</A> and see Sanday and Headlam at the place.
<P> See JERUBBAAL.
