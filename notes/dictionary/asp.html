            <P><B>ASP</B><P> (pethen (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+32:33" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 32:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+20:14,16">Job 20:14,16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+11:8">Isaiah 11:8</A>); aspis (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+3:13">Romans 3:13</A>)); Any poisonous snake, or even poisonous snakes in general, would satisfy the context in all the passages cited. Pethen is also translated <a href="adder.html">ADDER</a> (which see) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+58:4">Psalms 58:4</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+91:13">91:13</A>. Most authors have supposed the Egyptian cobra (Naia haje, L.) to be the snake meant, but while this is widely distributed throughout Africa, its occurrence in Southern Palestine seems to rest solely on the authority of Canon Tristram, who did not collect it.
<P> There are Other poisonous snakes in Palestine, any one of which would satisfy the requirements of these passages. See <a href="serpent.html" target="_blank">SERPENT</a>. While the aspis of classical Greek literature may well have been the Egyptian cobra, it is to be noted that Vipera aspis, L., is confined to central and western Europe.
