            <P><B>HIP</B><P> (shoq, "leg," "limb," "hip," "shoulder"):
<P> Samson smote the Philistines "hip and thigh" (Hebrew "leg upon thigh"), which was indicative of "a great slaughter" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+15:8">Judges 15:8</A>), the bodies being hewed in pieces with such violence that they lay in bloody confusion, their limbs piled up on one another in great heaps.
