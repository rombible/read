            <P><B>MORROW AFTER THE SABBATH</B><P> (mochorath, or mochoratham, "the morrow," or "tomorrow," "the day following"; mochorath ha-shabbath, "the day after the Sabbath," i.e. the first day of the week):
<P> The first day of the week was designated for the formal offering of the first-fruits in the form of wave-sheaves (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+23:11">Leviticus 23:11</A>), and of the wave-loaves 50 days later (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+23:16,17">Leviticus 23:16,17</A>). This recognition of an after-Sabbath during festive periods has its counterpart in the later ecclesiastical practice of celebrating not only Easter Sunday, but also Easter Monday, etc., and undoubtedly was a factor in establishing the custom which transferred the sanctity of the Sabbath to the first day of the week after the resurrection of our Lord.
<P> Frank E. Hirsch
