            <P><B>MORROW, TOMORROW</B><P> mor'-o, too-mor'-o:
<P> Two words are used in the Old Testament in this meaning: boqer, which properly means "dawn," or "morning," and machar, properly the same, but used for the next morning and hence, "tomorrow," like the German morgen. The derivative mo-chorath, is "the following day," "all the next day," especially after yom ("day"), but usually coupled with a noun following, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+23:11">Leviticus 23:11</A>, mochorath ha-shabbath "day after the Sabbath." It is also used adverbially for "on the morrow," as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+19:34">Genesis 19:34</A>.
<P> In the Greek of the New Testament we find aurion (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+6:34">Matthew 6:34</A>, etc.), commonly used, but hexes, also occurs (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+25:17">Acts 25:17</A> the King James Version, where the Revised Version (British and American) renders more exactly "the next day"); epaurion, is "on the morrow" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+10:9,23,24">Acts 10:9,23,24</A>).
