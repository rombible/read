            <P><B>SKIRT</B><P> skurt:
<P> (1) kanaph, "wing" "extremity" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+3:9">Ruth 3:9</A>, etc.), is the usual word. But in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+24:4">1&nbsp;Samuel 24:4</A> perhaps "corner" is the best translation.
<P> (2) shul, "loose hanging" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+28:33">Exodus 28:33</A>, etc.; in the King James Version often rendered "hem").
<P> (3) peh, "mouth," "opening" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+133:2">Psalms 133:2</A>, "the precious oil .... that came down upon the skirt"). But the "opening" is that for is that for the head, so that the Revised Version margin "collar" is the correct translation.
<P> "Skirt" is frequently used in a euphemistic sense, for which the commentaries must be consulted.
<P> See DRESS; TRAIN.
