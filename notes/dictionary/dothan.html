            <P><B>DOTHAN</B><P> do'-than (dothayin, dothan, "two wells," "double feast"; Dothaeim):
<P> A place to the North of Shechem whither Jacob's sons went for pasture for the flocks; where Joseph who followed them was sold to the Ishmaelites, after having been imprisoned in a "pit" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+37:17">Genesis 37:17</A>). Here in later days the eyes of Elisha's servant were opened to see the mountain "full of horses and chariots of fire," guarding his master from the encircling Syrians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+6:13">2&nbsp;Kings 6:13</A>). This is certainly to be identified with Tell Dothan, which lies on the East of the ancient road leading from Gilead across Esdraelon to the seacoast, and thence to Egypt. It is about 5 miles to the Southwest of Jenin. There are some traces of old buildings, two cisterns--Dothayin or Dothayin = "two cisterns" or "pits"- -and one copious spring. Excellent pasture is found in the surrounding plain, and on the adjoining slopes.
