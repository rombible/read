            <P><B>SECT</B><P> sekt (hairesis):
<P> "Sect" (Latin, secta, from sequi, "to follow") is in the New Testament the translation of hairesis, from haireo, "to take," "to choose"; also translated "heresy," not heresy in the later ecclesiastical sense, but a school or party, a sect, without any bad meaning attached to it. The word is applied to schools of philosophy; to the Pharisees and Sadducees among the Jews who adhered to a common religious faith and worship; and to the Christians. It is translated "sect" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</A>, of the Sadducees; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+15:5">Acts 15:5</A>, of the Pharisees; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</A>, of the Nazarenes; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</A>, of the Pharisees; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+28:22">Acts 28:22</A>, of the Christians); also the Revised Version (British and American) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</A> (the King James Version and the English Revised Version margin "heresy"), "After the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers" (just as the Pharisees were "a sect"); it is translated "heresies" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+11:19">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:19</A>, margin "sects," the American Standard Revised Version "factions," margin "Greek: `heresies' "; the English Revised Version reverses the American Standard Revised Version text and margin; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</A>, the American Standard Revised Version "parties," margin "heresies"; the English Revised Version reverses text and margin; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:1">2&nbsp;Peter 2:1</A>, "damnable heresies," the Revised Version (British and American) "destructive heresies," margin "sects of perdition"); the "sect" in itself might be harmless; it was the teaching or principles which should be followed by those sects that would make them "destructive." Hairesis occurs in 1 Macc 8:30 ("They shall do it at their pleasure," i.e. "choice"); compare Septuagint <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+22:18,21">Leviticus 22:18,21</A>.
