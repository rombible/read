<P> "Range" and "rank" have the same derivation, and in the sense of a "row" (of men, etc.) they were formerly interchangeable. "Range" with this meaning is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+11:8,15">2&nbsp;Kings 11:8,15</A> the King James Version parallel <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+23:14">2&nbsp;Chronicles 23:14</A> (the Revised Version (British and American) "rank"; sedherah, "row"). Hence, "to range" is "to set in a line" (Judith 2:16; 2 Macc 12:20, diatasso) or "to move in a line" or, simply, "to roam," whence "a ranging bear" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+28:15">Proverbs 28:15</A>; shaqaq, "run to and fro"). A cooking "range" is a stove on which pots, etc., can be set in a row, but the kirayim of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:35">Leviticus 11:35</A> is a much more primitive affair, composed, probably, of two plates (kirayim is a dual). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+39:8">Job 39:8</A> "range of the mountains" is good modern use, but ythr, should be pointed yathur (not yethur as in Massoretic Text) and connected with tur, "search." So translate. "He searcheth out the mountains as his pasture."
