            <P><B>CONCERNING</B><P> kon-surn'-ing:
<P> The Revised Version (British and American) makes frequent changes, such as "for," "as for," "from," "about," for "concerning"; "concerning" instead of "for," "of," "over," "in," "against," etc. Some of the other changes are, "unto that which is good" for "concerning" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:19">Romans 16:19</A>), "concerning" instead of "because of" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+23:9">Jeremiah 23:9</A>), for "the miracle of" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+6:52">Mark 6:52</A>); for "with" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+10:41">Mark 10:41</A>), for "of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</A>), "concerning Jesus" (diferent text), "by way of disparagement" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+11:21">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:21</A>), instead of "concerning reproach"; "Why askest thou me concerning that which is good?" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</A>) instead of "Why callest thou me good?" (different text; see the Revised Version, margin).
