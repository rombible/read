            <P><B>VEX, VEXATION</B><P> veks, vek-sa'-shun:
<P> "Vex," meaning originally to shake or toss in carrying, has a much more intensive meaning in Scripture than in common modern usage. It represents over a score of Hebrew and Greek words, most of them translated by this word only once, and many of them changed in the Revised Version (British and American) into other forms. Thus bahel in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+6:2,3,10">Psalms 6:2,3,10</A>. is in the American Standard Revised Version "troubled" (in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+2:5">Psalms 2:5</A>, the Revised Version margin. "trouble"); tsarar in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+9:27">Nehemiah 9:27</A> is in the Revised Version (British and American) "distressed";. pascho in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+17:15">Matthew 17:15</A> is "suffereth grievously"; kakoo in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+12:1">Acts 12:1</A> is "afflict," etc. So "vexation only" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:19">Isaiah 28:19</A> is in the Revised Version (British and American) "nought but terror," and there are other changes of this word (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+28:20">Deuteronomy 28:20</A>, "discomfiture"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+9:1">Isaiah 9:1</A>, "in anguish"). On the other hand, the Revised Version (British and American) has "vex" for "distress" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+2:9,19">Deuteronomy 2:9,19</A>); "they that vex" for "the adversaries of" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+11:13">Isaiah 11:13</A>); "vexeth himself" for "meddleth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+26:17">Proverbs 26:17</A>), etc.
