            <P><B>PALANQUIN</B><P> pal-an-ken':
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+3:9">Song of Solomon 3:9</A> occurs 'appiryon, a word that has no Semitic cognates and is of dubious meaning. In form, however, it resembles the Sanskrit paryanka, and still more closely the Greek phoreion, both of which mean "litter bed." Hence, the Revised Version (British and American) "palanquin" (ultimately derived from paryanka). The margin "car of state" and the King James Version "chariot" are mere guesses.
