            <P><B>SYROPHOENICIAN</B><P> si'-ro-fe-nish'-an, sir-o- (Surophoinissa, Surophoinikissa; Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek has variant Sura Phoinikissa; the King James Version Syrophenician):
<P> The woman from the borders of Tyre and Sidon whose daughter Jesus healed is described as "a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+7:26">Mark 7:26</A>), and again as "a Canaanitish woman" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+15:22">Matthew 15:22</A>). This seems to mean that she was of Canaanite descent, a native of the Phoenician seaboard, Greek in religion, and probably also in speech. The names Syria and Phoenicia are both applied to the same region in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+21:2,3">Acts 21:2,3</A>. Syrophoenician may therefore denote simply an inhabitant of these parts. According to Strabo (xvii.3), this district was called Syrophoenicia to distinguish it from the North African Lybophoenicia.
