            <P><B>MARTYR</B><P> mar'-ter (martus, Aeolic martur):
<P> One who gives heed, and so, a "witness," so translated in numerous passages, both as of one bearing testimony, and also as of one who is a spectator of anything (see WITNESS). In the King James Version rendered "martyr" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</A>, "thy martyr Stephen"; and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</A>, "Antipas my faithful martyr"; also 17:6, "the blood of the martyrs of Jesus," where alone the American Standard Revised Version retains "martyrs." These 3 passages are the beginning of the use of the word "martyr" for such witnesses as were faithful even unto death, its uniform modern use.
