            <P><B>MAIMED</B><P> mam'-d (charuts; kullos, anaperos):
<P> The condition of being mutilated or rendered imperfect as the result of accident, in contrast to congenital malformation. An animal thus affected was declared to be unfit to be offered in sacrifice as a peace offering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+22:22">Leviticus 22:22</A>); although under certain conditions a congenitally deformed animal might be accepted as a free-will offering, apparently the offering of a maimed animal was always prohibited (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+22:23,24">Leviticus 22:23,24</A>). The use of such animals in sacrifice was one of the charges brought against the Jews of his time by Malachi (1:8-14). The word is also used to denote those who were so mutilated. Among those made whole by our Lord in Galilee were the maimed as well as the halt (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+15:30">Matthew 15:30</A>).
<P> Figuratively the casting off of any evil habit or distracting condition which interferes with the spiritual life is called "maiming" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+18:8">Matthew 18:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:43">Mark 9:43</A>); with this may be taken the lesson in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+19:12">Matthew 19:12</A>. In these passages "maimed" (kullos) is used of injuries of the upper limb, and cholos of those affecting the feet, rendering one halt. Hippocrates, however, uses kullos for a deformation of the legs in which the knees are bent so far outward as to render the patient lame; while he applies the term cholos as a generic name for any distortion, and in one place uses it to describe a mutilation of the head (Prorrhetica, 83). The maimed and the halt are among the outcasts who are to be brought into the gospel feast according to the parable (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+14:13-21">Luke 14:13-21</A>).
