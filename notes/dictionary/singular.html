            <P><B>SINGULAR</B><P> sin'-gu-lar:
<P> "Pertaining to the single person," "individual," and so sometimes "unusual," "remarkable." So The Wisdom of Solomon 14:18, the King James Version "the singular diligence of the artificer" (philotimia, "love of honor," the Revised Version (British and American) "ambition"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+27:2">Leviticus 27:2</A> by "when a man shall make a singular vow" the King James Version seems to have understood a "personal" or "private" vow. the Revised Version (British and American) has "accomplish a vow," with margin "make a special vow." Compare the same phrase (yaphli' (yephalle') nedher) used of the Nazirite vow in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+6:2">Numbers 6:2</A>.
