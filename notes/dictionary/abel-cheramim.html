            <P><B>ABEL-CHERAMIM</B><P> a'-bel-ker'-a-mim ('abhel keramim, "meadow of vineyards"):
<P> A city mentioned in the Revised Version (British and American) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+11:33">Judges 11:33</A>, along with Aroer, Minnith, and "twenty cities," in summarizing Jephthah's campaign against the Ammonites. The King James Version translates "the plain of the vineyards." The site has not been identified, though Eusebius and Jerome speak of it as in their time a village about seven Roman miles from the Ammonite city of Rabbah.
