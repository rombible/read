            <P><B>REGION</B><P> re'-jun:
<P> A "district," as in modern English. The word "region" is used by English Versions of the Bible interchangeably with "country," "coasts," etc., for various Hebrew and Greek terms, but "region round about" is usually in the King James Version and invariably in the Revised Version (British and American) the translation of perichoros, "surrounding country." For a possible technical use of "region" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</A> and the Revised Version (British and American) 18:23.
<P> See GALATIA.
