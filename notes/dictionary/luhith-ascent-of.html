            <P><B>LUHITH, ASCENT OF</B><P> lu'-hith, loo'-hith, ma`-aleh ha-luchith):
<P> A place named in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:5">Isaiah 15:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:5">Jeremiah 48:5</A>. It is clearly identical with the way, or descent, of Horonaim. Eusebius, Onomasticon places Luhith between Areopolis and Zoar. Some way is intended by which fugitives from the Arabah could reach the uplands of the Moabite plateau. Guthe thinks it may be the road which leads from the district of the ancient Zoar on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea to the uplands through Wady Bene Hammad. Along this track ran also a Roman road. If Horonaim were the higher of the two places, this might account for the way being called the "descent" of Horonaim as going down from that place, and the "ascent" of Luhith as going up thence. Neither place can as yet be identified with certainty.
