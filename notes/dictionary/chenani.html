            <P><B>CHENANI</B><P> ke-na'-ni (kenani, "planted"):
<P> One of the names mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+9:4">Nehemiah 9:4</A>, in connection with the constitution of "congregation." If the names represent houses or families, eight Levitical houses probably sang some well-known psalm on this occasion. If they are names of individual representatives, they were probably deputed to recite or chant some special prayer in order to lead the worship of the people.
