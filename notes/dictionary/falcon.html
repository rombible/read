            <P><B>FALCON</B><P> fo'-k'-n, fol'-k'-n, fal'-kun:
<P> The Hebrews did not know the word. Their bird corresponding to our falcon, in all probability, was one of the smaller kestrels covered by the word nets, which seemed to cover all lesser birds of prey that we include in the hawk family. That some of our many divisions of species were known to them is indicated by the phrase "after its kind." The word occurs in the Revised Version (British and American) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+28:7">Job 28:7</A>, to translation 'ayyah, Greek gups (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+11:14">Leviticus 11:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:13">Deuteronomy 14:13</A>):
<P> "That path no bird of prey knoweth,
<P> Neither hath the falcon's eye seen it."
<P> This substitutes "falcon" for "vulture" in the King James Version. The change weakens the force of the lines. All ornithologists know that eagles, vultures and the large hawks have such range of vision that they at once descend from heights at which we cannot see them to take prey on earth or food placed to tempt them. The falcons and sparrow hawks are small members of the family, some of which feed on little birds, some on insects. They are not celebrated for greater range of vision than other birds of the same location and feeding habits. The strength of these lines lay in the fact that if the path to the mine were so well concealed that the piercing eye of the vulture failed to find it, then it was perfectly hidden indeed.
