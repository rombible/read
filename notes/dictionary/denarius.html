            <P><B>DENARIUS</B><P> de-na'-ri-us (denarion):
<P> A Roman silver coin, 25 of which went to the aureus, the standard gold coin of the empire in the time of Augustus, which was equal in value to about one guinea or ,25; more exactly ?1.0,6 = .00, the ? = ,866. Hence, the value of the denarius would be about 20 cents and this was the ordinary wage of a soldier and a day laborer. The word is uniformly rendered "penny" in the King James Version and "shilling" in the American Standard Revised Version, except in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+22:19" target="_blank">Matthew 22:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+12:15">Mark 12:15</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+20:24">Luke 20:24</A>, where the Latin word is used, since in these passsages it refers to the coin in which tribute was paid to the Roman government.
