After the death of his three brothers, Amnon, Chileab and Absalom, he became eldest son; and when his fathers strength was visibly declining, put forward his pretensions to the crown. Adonijahs cause was espoused by Abiathar and by Joab the famous commander of Davids army. [<B><a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/smiths-bible-dictionary/joab.html" target="_blank" url="joab.html">JOAB</a></B>] His name and influence secured a large number of followers among the captains of the royal army belonging to the tribe of Judah, comp.

[EN-ROGEL] Apprised of these proceedings, David immediately caused Solomon to be proclaimed king, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/1-33.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/1-33.html">1 Kings 1:33</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/1-34.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/1-34.html">1 Kings 1:34</a> ) at Gihon. [<B><a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/smiths-bible-dictionary/gihon.html" target="_blank" url="gihon.html">GIHON</a></B>] This decisive measure struck terror into the opposite party, and Adonijah fled to the sanctuary, but was pardoned by Solomon on condition that he should "show himself a worthy man."
