The most remarkable occurred in the reign of Uzziah. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/zechariah/14-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/zechariah/14-5.html">Zechariah 14:5</a> ) From ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/zechariah/14-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/zechariah/14-4.html">Zechariah 14:4</a> ) we are led to infer that a great convulsion took place at this time in the Mount of Olives, the mountain being split so as to leave a valley between its summit. An earthquake occurred at the time of our Saviours crucifixion. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=Matthew+27:51-54" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+27:51-54&amp;t=niv">Matthew 27:51-54</a> ) Earthquakes are not unfrequently accompanied by fissures of the earths surface; instances of this are recorded in connection with the destruction of Korah and his company, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/16-32.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/16-32.html">Numbers 16:32</a> ) and at the time of our Lords death, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-51.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-51.html">Matthew 27:51</a> ) the former may be paralleled by a similar occurrence at Oppido in Calabria A.D. 1783, where the earth opened to the extent of five hundred and a depth of more than two hundred feet. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
