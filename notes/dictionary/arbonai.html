            <P><B>ARBONAI</B><P> ar-bo'-nai, ar-bo'na-i (Abrona):
<P> A torrent mentioned in Judith 2:24. Beyond what is indicated in this passage, it is not possible to determine the location; but from this it appears to have been near Cilicia. Identification with the modern Nahr Ibrahim is rejected on the ground (1) that the ancient name of this river was Adonis, and (2) that this does not answer to the term "torrent" applied by Judith. A possible misreading of "the high cities that were be`ebher ha- nahar" ("beyond the river"; Encyclopedia Biblica under the word).
