            <P><B>RHINOCEROS</B><P> ri-nos'-er-os:
<P> This word is found in the King James Version margin to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+34:7">Isaiah 34:7</A> ("rhinocerots") for re'emim, the King James Version "unicorns," the Revised Version (British and American) "wild-oxen." The word is quite inappropriate to the passage, which refers to the land of Edom. The one-horned rhinoceros, Rhinoceros unicornis, is confined to India. Other rhinoceroses are found in India and in equatorial Africa, but it is hardly to be presumed that these animals were meant by the Hebrew writers.
<P> See UNICORN.
