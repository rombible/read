            <P><B>YOKE</B><P> yok:
<P> (1) The usual word is `ol (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+27:40">Genesis 27:40</A>, etc.), less commonly the (apparently later) form moTah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+58:6">Isaiah 58:6</A>, etc.; in Nab 1:13 moT), which the Revised Version (British and American) in Jer 27; 28 translates "bar" (a most needless and obscuring change). The Greek in Apocrypha (Sirach 28:19, etc.) and in the New Testament (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</A>, etc.) is invariably zugos. Egyptian monuments show a yoke that consisted of a straight bar fastened to the foreheads of the cattle at the root of the horns, and such yokes were no doubt used in Palestine also; but the more usual form was one that rested on the neck (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+27:40">Genesis 27:40</A>, etc.). It was provided with straight "bars" (moToth in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+26:13">Leviticus 26:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+34:27">Ezekiel 34:27</A>) projecting downward, against which the shoulders of the oxen pressed, and it was held in position by thongs or "bonds" (moceroth in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+2:20">Jeremiah 2:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+5:5">5:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+27:2">27:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+30:8">30:8</A>; 'aghuddoth in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+58:6">Isaiah 58:6</A>, "bands"), fastened under the animals' throats. Such yokes could of course be of any weight (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+12:4">1&nbsp;Kings 12:4</A>), depending on the nature of the work to be done, but the use of "iron yokes" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+28:48">Deuteronomy 28:48</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+28:13">Jeremiah 28:13</A>) must have been very rare, if, indeed, the phrase is anything more than a figure of speech.
<P> What is meant by "the yoke on their jaws" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+11:4">Hosea 11:4</A> is quite obscure. Possibly a horse's bit is meant; possibly the phrase is a condensed form for "the yoke that prevents their feeding"; possibly the text is corrupt.
<P> See JAW.
<P> The figurative use of "yoke" in the sense of "servitude" is intensely obvious (compare especially Jer 27, 28). Attention needs to be called only to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+3:27">Lamentations 3:27</A>, where "disciplining sorrow" is meant, and to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+5:5">Jeremiah 5:5</A>, where the phrase is a figure for "the law of God." This last use became popular with the Jews at a later period and it is found, e.g. in Apocrypha Baruch 41:3; Psalter of Solomon 7:9; 17:32; Ab. iii.7,. and in this sense the phrase is employed. by Christ in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</A> f. "My yoke" here means "the service of God as I teach it" (the common interpretation, "the sorrows that I bear," is utterly irrelevant) and the emphasis is on "my." The contrast is not between "yoke" and "no yoke," but between "my teaching" (light yoke) and "the current scribal teaching'; (heavy yoke).
<P> (2) "Yoke" in the sense of "a pair of oxen" is tsemedh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+11:7">1&nbsp;Samuel 11:7</A>, etc.), or zeugos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+14:19">Luke 14:19</A>).
