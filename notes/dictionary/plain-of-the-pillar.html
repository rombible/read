<P> With the Revised Version margin we must read "terebinth of the pillar," the place where the men of Shechem and Beth-millo made Abimelech king (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+9:6" target="_blank">Judges 9:6</A>). This was one of the sacred trees of which there seem to have been several near Shechem. See <a href="meonenim-oak-of.html">MEONENIM, OAK OF</a>. "The pillar" may possibly have been the great stone which Joshua set up "under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+24:26">Joshua 24:26</A>).
