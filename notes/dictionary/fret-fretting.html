            <P><B>FRET, FRETTING</B><P> (charah, ma'ar):
<P> To "fret" is from for (prefix) and etan, "to eat," "to consume." The word is both transitive and intransitive in King James Version:
<P> (1) transitive as translation of charah, "to burn," Hithpael, "to fret one's self," "to be angry" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+37:1">Psalms 37:1</A>, "Fret not thyself because of evil-doers";
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+37:7,8">Psalms 37:7,8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+24:19">Proverbs 24:19</A>); of qatsaph, "to be angry," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+8:21">Isaiah 8:21</A>, "They shall fret themselves, and curse," etc.); of raghaz, to be moved" (with anger, etc.) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+16:43">Ezekiel 16:43</A>, "Thou hast fretted me in all these things," the American Standard Revised Version "raged against me"). For <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:55">Leviticus 13:55</A>, see under Fretting below.
<P> (2) Intransitive, it is the translation of ra`am, "to rage," Hiphil, "to provoke to anger" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:6">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:6</A>, "Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret"); of za`aph, "to be sad," "to fret" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+19:3">Proverbs 19:3</A>, "His heart fretteth against Yahweh").
<P> Fretting in the sense of eating away, consuming, is used of the leprosy, ma'ar, "to be sharp, bitter, painful" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:51,52">Leviticus 13:51,52</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+14:44">14:44</A>, "a fretting leprosy"; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:55">Leviticus 13:55</A> we have "it (is) fret inward" ("fret" past participle), as the translation of pehetheth from pahath, "to dig" (a pit), the word meaning "a depression," "a hollow or sunken spot in a garment affected by a kind of leprosy," the Revised Version (British and American) "it is a fret."
<P> Revised Version has "fretful" for "angry" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+21:19">Proverbs 21:19</A>), margin "vexation."
