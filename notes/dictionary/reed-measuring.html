            <P><B>REED, MEASURING</B><P> mezh'-ur-ing (qeneh ha-middah):
<P> In Ezekiel's vision of the temple a "man" (an angel) appears with a "measuring reed" to measure the dimensions of the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:3">Ezekiel 40:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+42:16">42:16</A>). The reed is described as 6 cubits long, "of a cubit and a handbreadth each," i.e. the cubit used was a handbreadth longer than the common cubit (see CUBIT; WEIGHTS AND MEASURES; TEMPLE). In the Apocalypse this idea of a measuring reed reappears for measuring the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</A>) and the holy city (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+21:15,16">Revelation 21:15,16</A>, "a golden reed"). The thought conveyed is exactitude in the dimensions of these edifices, symbolic of the symmetry and perfection of God's church.
