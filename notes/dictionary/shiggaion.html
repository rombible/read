            <P><B>SHIGGAION</B><P> shi-ga'-yon, shi-gi'-on (shiggayon):
<P> Occurs in the title of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+7">Psalms 7</A>, and, in the plural, in the verse introducing Habakkuk's prayer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+3:1">Habakkuk 3:1</A>). Derived from a verb meaning "to wander," it is generally taken to mean a dithyramb, or rhapsody. This is not supported by the Greek VSS, but they are evidently quite at a loss.
<P> See PSALMS, BOOK OF.
