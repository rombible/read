<P> Mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:31">1&nbsp;Kings 4:31</A> as one of the wise men with whom Solomon was compared. The better orthography is Calcol which the King James Version gives for the same name in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:6">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:6</A>. In the former passage, Calcol is the son of Mahol, while in the latter he is called the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah, and a brother of Heman and Ethan.
