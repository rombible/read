( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/5-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/5-23.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:23</a> ) It stands at the southern end, and is the culminating point of the anti-Libanus range; it towers high above the ancient border city of Dan and the fountains of the Jordan, and is the most conspicuous and beautiful mountain in Palestine or Assyria. At the present day it is called <I>Jebel esh-Sheikh</I> , "the chief mountain," and <I>Jebel eth-Thelj</I> , "snowy mountain." When the whole country is parched with the summer sun, white lines of snow streak the head of Hermon. This mountain was the great landmark of the Israelites. It was associated with their northern border almost as intimately as the sea was with the western. Hermon has three summits, situated like the angles of a triangle, and about a quarter of a mile from each other. In two passages of Scripture this mountain is called <I>Baal-hermon</I> , ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/3-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/judges/3-3.html">Judges 3:3</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/5-23.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/5-23.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:23</a> ) possibly because Baal was there worshipped. (It is more than probable that some part of Hermon was the scene of the transfiguration, as it stands near Caesarea Philippi, where we know Christ was just before that event --ED.) The height of Hermon has never been measured, though it has often been estimated. It may safely be reckoned at 10,000 feet. </FONT></body></html>
