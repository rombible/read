            <P><B>RECORDER</B><P> re-kor'-der (mazkir; the Revised Version margin "chronicler"):
<P> A high functionary in the court of the Jewish kings, part of whose duty seems to have been to chronicle the events of the reign, but who also occupied a position corresponding with that of the modern vizier (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:16">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:16</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+20:24">20:24</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+18:15">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:15</A>, etc.). His high rank is shown by the facts that, with other officers, he represented Hezekiah in speaking with Rabshakeh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+18:18">2&nbsp;Kings 18:18</A>), and, in the reign of Josiah, superintended the repairs of the temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:8">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:8</A>).
