            <P><B>SHEREBIAH</B><P> sher-e-bi'-a, she-reb'-ya (sherebhyah, "God has sent burning heat"(?); the form is doubtful):
<P> A post-exilic priest and family. Sherebiah, who joined Ezra at the river Ahava (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:18">Ezra 8:18</A>; the Septuagint omits), and had charge, along with eleven others, of the silver and gold and vessels for the Temple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+8:24">Ezra 8:24</A>, Codex Vaticanus and Codex Alexandrinus Saraia, Lucian, Sarabias). He aided in the exposition of the Law (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+8:7">Nehemiah 8:7</A>), was among those who made public confession (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+9:4">Nehemiah 9:4</A>) and sealed the covenant (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+10:12">Nehemiah 10:12</A>)). His name also appears in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+12:8,24">Nehemiah 12:8,24</A>. In every passage listed above except 10:12 (13), Codex Vaticanus and Codex Alexandrinus read Sarabia, Lucian, Sarabias. In 1 Esdras 8:47 the name appears as "Asebebia," the Revised Version (British and American) "Asebebias"; in 1 Esdras 8:54, "Esebrias," the Revised Version (British and American) "Eserebias," and 1 Esdras 9:48, "Sarabias." Many of the companion-names on the lists are plainly ethnic (Cheyne).
