<P> Occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+21:13">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:13</A>, as the translation of tawah: "David .... feigned himself mad and scrabbled on the doors of the gate." "To scrabble" (modern English "scrawl") is here to make unmeaning marks; tawah means "to make a mark" from taw, "a mark," especially as a cross (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+9:4">Ezekiel 9:4</A>), a signature (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+31:35">Job 31:35</A>, see the Revised Version (British and American)), the name of the Hebrew letter taw ("t") originally made in the form of a cross; the Revised Version margin has "made marks"; but Septuagint has tumpanizo, "to beat as a drum," which the Vulgate, Ewald, Driver and others follow ("beat upon" or "drummed on the doors of the city," which seems more probable).
