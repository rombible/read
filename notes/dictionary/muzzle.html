            <P><B>MUZZLE</B><P> muz'l (chacam; phimoo)  According to the Deuteronomic injunction (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+25:4">Deuteronomy 25:4</A>), the ox was not to be muzzled while treading the grain, i.e. threshing. The muzzle was a guard placed on the mouth of the oxen to prevent them from biting or eating. The threshing ox would have ample opportunity of feeding (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+10:11">Hosea 10:11</A>). The Deuteronomic injunction is quite in accordance with the humane spirit which inspires it all through. Paul quotes this law in two places (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+9:9">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:18">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:18</A>) to illustrate his view that the "laborer is worthy of his hire."
<P> T. Lewis
