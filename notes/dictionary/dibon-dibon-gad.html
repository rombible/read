            <P><B>DIBON; DIBON-GAD</B><P> di'-bon (dibhon, "washing"; Daibon):
<P> (1) A city of Moab captured by the Amorites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:30">Numbers 21:30</A>), and held by them at the invasion by Israel. It was taken and given to the tribe of Gad, whence it is called Dibon-gad (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+32:34">Numbers 32:34</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:45">33:45</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:17">Joshua 13:17</A> it is reckoned to Reuben. Along with other cities in the territory North of the Arnon, Dibon changed hands several times between Moab and Israel. Mesha claims it (MS), and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+48:18,22">Jeremiah 48:18,22</A> it is named among the cities of Moab. The form of the name, Dimon, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:9">Isaiah 15:9</A>, may have been given to make it resemble the Hebrew dam, "blood," to support the play upon words in the verse (HDB, under the word). It is represented by the modern Dhiban, about 4 miles North of Aroer (`Ara`ir), on the line of the old Roman road. The ruins that spread over two adjacent knolls are of no importance:
<P> walls, a tower, cistern, etc. Near Dibon the famous Moabite Stone was found.
<P> (2) A town in Judah, occupied after the exile (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:25">Nehemiah 11:25</A>). It may be the same as Dimonah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:22">Joshua 15:22</A>); unidentified.
