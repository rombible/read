The first two are in the Authorized Version. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/8-28.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/8-28.html">Matthew 8:28</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/5-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/5-1.html">Mark 5:1</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/8-26.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/8-26.html">Luke 8:26</a> ) In Gerasenes in place of Gadarenes. The miracle referred to took place, without doubt, near the town of Gergesa, the modern <I>Kersa</I> , close by the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, and hence in the country of Gergesenes. But as Gergesa was a small village, and little known, the evangelists, who wrote for more distant readers, spoke of the event as taking place in the country of the Gadarenes, so named from its largest city, Gadara; and this country included the country of the Gergesenes as a state includes a county. The Gerasenes were the people of the district of which Gerasa was the capital. This city was better known than Gadara or Gergesa; indeed in the Roman age no city of Palestine was better known. "It became one of the proudest cities of Syria." It was situated some 30 miles southeast of Gadara, on the borders of Peraea and a little north of the river Jabbok. It is now called <I>Jerash</I> and is a deserted ruin. The district of the Gerasenes probably included that of the Gadarenes; so that the demoniac of Gergesa belonged to the country of the Gadarenes and also to that of the Gerasenes, as the same person may, with equal truth, be said to live in the city or the state, or in the United States. For those near by the local name would be used; but in writing to a distant people, as the Greeks and Romans, the more comprehensive and general name would be given. --ED.) </FONT></body></html>
