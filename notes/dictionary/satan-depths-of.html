            <P><B>SATAN, DEPTHS OF</B><P> (ta bathea tou Satana):
<P> Found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+2:24">Revelation 2:24</A>, and has reference to false teaching at Thyatira. It is a question (that perhaps may not be decided) whether tou Satana, "of Satan," represents the claim of the false teachers, or is thrown in by the Lord. Did those false teachers claim to know "the depths" of Satan? Or was it that they claimed to know "the depths" of Deity, and the Lord said it was rather "the depths of Satan"? In either case the antithesis to "depths of Satan" is "depths of God," as referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+2:10">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:10</A>.
