            <P><B>DROPSY</B><P> drop'-si (hudropikos, "a man afflicted with hudrops or dropsy"):
<P> Both forms of this disease occur in Palestine, that in which the limbs and body are distended with water called anasarca, depending generally on cardiac or renal disease, and the form confined to the abdomen, usually the result of liver infection. The latter is the commoner, as liver disease is a frequent result of recurrent attacks of malarial fever. The man was evidently able to move about, as he had entered into the Pharisee's house (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+14:2">Luke 14:2</A>).
