            <P><B>GAIN</B><P> gan:
<P> In the Old Testament the translation of three Hebrew substantives, betsa`, "unjust gain," "any gain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+5:19">Judges 5:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+22:3">Job 22:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+1:19">Proverbs 1:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+15:27">15:27</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+33:15">Isaiah 33:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+56:11">56:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+22:13,17">Ezekiel 22:13,17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+4:13">Micah 4:13</A>); mechir, "price" for which a thing is sold (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+11:39">Daniel 11:39</A>, the only place where the Hebrew word is translated "gain" in the King James Version, though it occurs in other places translated "price"); tebhu'ah, "produce," "profits," "fruit" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+3:14">Proverbs 3:14</A>). It is the translation of one Hebrew verb, batsa`, "to gain dishonestly" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+27:8">Job 27:8</A>); of one Aramaic verb, zebhan, "to buy," "procure for oneself" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=da+2:8">Daniel 2:8</A>, here used of buying time, i.e. "seeking delay" (Gesenius)).
<P> In the New Testament, the translation of three Greek substantives, ergasia, "gain gotten by work," "profit" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+16:16,19">Acts 16:16,19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:24">19:24</A> (the King James Version)); kerdos, "gain," "advantage" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+3:7">3:7</A>, in the former, Paul asserting that to him to die was a personal advantage, because then he would "be with Christ"; in the latter, he counts as "loss" his personal privileges in the flesh, when compared with "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ"); porismos, "gain," "a source of gain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+6:5,6">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:5,6</A>, where the apostle asserts, not "gain" (earthly) is godliness, but godliness is "gain" (real, abiding)).
<P> It is the translation of three Greek vbs., kerdaino, "to gain," "acquire," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</A>, where Jesus teaches that the soul, or life in its highest sense ("his own self," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+9:25">Luke 9:25</A>), is worth more than the "gaining" of the whole (material) world; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+18:15">Matthew 18:15</A>, concerning the winning of a sinning brother by private interview; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+25:17,22">Matthew 25:17,22</A>, the parable of the Talents; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:21">Acts 27:21</A> the King James Version, injury "gained," sustained, by sailing from Crete; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+9:19,20">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:19,20</A> bis, 21,22, all referring to Paul's life-principle of accommodation to others to "gain," win, them to Christ; in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+4:13">James 4:13</A> used in a commercial sense; poieo, "to make," "make gain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:18">Luke 19:18</A> the King James Version, the parable of the Pounds); prosergazomai, "to gain by trading" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+19:1">Luke 19:1</A>6, commercial use, in the same parallel).
