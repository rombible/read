The salutation at meeting consisted in early times of various expressions of blessing, such as "God be gracious unto thee," ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/43-29.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/43-29.html">Genesis 43:29</a> ) "The Lord be with you;" "The Lord bless thee." ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/2-4.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ruth/2-4.html">Ruth 2:4</a> ) Hence the term "bless" received the secondary sense of "salute." The salutation at parting consisted originally of a simple blessing, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-60.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-60.html">Genesis 24:60</a> ) but in later times the form "Go in peace," or rather "Farewell" ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/1-17.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/1-17.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:17</a> ) was common. In modern times the ordinary mode of address current in the East resembles the Hebrew <I>Es-selam aleykum</I> , "Peace be on you," and the term "salam," peace, has been introduced into our own language to describe the Oriental salutation. In epistolary salutations the writer placed-his own name first, and then that of the person whom he sainted. A form of prayer for spiritual mercies was also used. The concluding salutation consisted generally of the term "I salute," accompanied by a prayer for peace or grace. </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
