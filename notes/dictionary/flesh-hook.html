            <P><B>FLESH-HOOK</B><P> flesh'-hook (mazlegh, and plural mizlaghoth):
<P> One of the implements used around the sacrificial altar. According to Divine direction given to Moses (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+27:3">Exodus 27:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+38:3">38:3</A>), it was to be made of brass, but later David felt impelled by "the Spirit" or "in his spirit" to determine that for use in the magnificent Temple of Solomon it should be made of gold (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+28:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 28:17</A>). But Huram made it, with other altar articles, of "bright brass" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+4:16">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:16</A>).
<P> In Samuel's time, it was made with three hook-shaped tines, and was used in taking out the priests' share of the meat offering (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+2:13,14">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:13,14</A>). With the other altar utensils, it was in the special charge of the Kohathites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:14">Numbers 4:14</A>). The hooks mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+40:43">Ezekiel 40:43</A> were altogether different and for another purpose.
<P> See HOOK.
