            <P><B>AMPLIATUS</B><P> am-pli-a'-tus (Ampliatos, Codex Sinaiticus, A,B,F, Ampliatus; Amplias, D,E,L,P, the Revised Version (British and American) form; the King James Version Amplias):
<P> The name of a member of the Christian community at Rome, to whom Paul sent greetings (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:8">Romans 16:8</A>). He is designated "my beloved in the Lord." It is a common name and is found in inscriptions connected with the imperial household. The name is found twice in the cemetery of Domitilla. The earlier inscription is over a cell which belongs to the end of the 1st century or the beginning of the 2nd century. The bearer of this name was probably a member of her household and conspicuous in the early Christian church in Rome.
