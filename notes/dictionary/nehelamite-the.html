            <P><B>NEHELAMITE, THE</B><P> ne-hel'-a-mit, (ha-necheldmi):
<P> The designation of Shemaiah, a false prophet who opposed Jeremiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+29:24,31,32">Jeremiah 29:24,31,32</A>). The word means "dweller of Nehelam," but no such place-name is found in the Old Testament. Its etymology, however, suggests a connection with the Hebrew chalam, "to dream," and this has given rise to the rendering of the King James Version margin "dreamer."
