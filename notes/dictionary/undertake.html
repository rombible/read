            <P><B>UNDERTAKE</B><P> un-der-tak':
<P> "To take upon one's self," "assume responsibility," and so in Elizabethan English "be surety." In this sense in the King James Version <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+38:14">Isaiah 38:14</A>, "O Lord, .... undertake for me" (`arabh, the Revised Version (British and American) "be thou my surety"). Perhaps in the same sense in Sirach 29:19, although the idea is scarcely contained in the Greek verb dioko, "pursue." In the modern sense in 1 Esdras 1:28; 2 Macc 2:29; 8:10; the King James Version 2:27.
<P> See SURE; SURETY.
