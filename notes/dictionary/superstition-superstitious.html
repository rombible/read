            <P><B>SUPERSTITION; SUPERSTITIOUS</B><P> su-per-stish'-un; su-per-stish'-us (deisidaimonia, "fearing demons"):
<P> The Biblical use of these words is limited to that of the former in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+25:19">Acts 25:19</A> the King James Version, and of the latter in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:22">Acts 17:22</A>. In the former reference, Festus speaks of the Jews' "superstition" (the Revised Version (British and American) "religion"), thus artfully dodging an avowal of his own convictions "respecting the Hebrew faith." In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:22">Acts 17:22</A> the King James Version Paul tactfully refers to the Athenians as being "too superstitious" (the Revised Version (British and American) "too religious"), thus using the term correctly from both their and his point of view. They were truly too "religious" with their superstitions.
