<P> One of David's "braves" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:27">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:27</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:18">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:18</A> he is named "Sibbechai" (the Revised Version (British and American) "Sibbecai"), and is there mentioned as the slayer of a Philistine giant. The Revised Version (British and American) spelling occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+11:29">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:29</A>, the King James Version "Sibbechai" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+20:4">1&nbsp;Chronicles 20:4</A> (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+21:18">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:18</A>); and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+27:11">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:11</A> the Revised Version (British and American) spelling recurs, where this person is mentioned as captain of the 8th course of the 12 monthly courses that served the king in rota. Scribal error, and the similarity in Hebrew spelling of the two forms accounts for the difference in spelling. the Revised Version (British and American) consistently tries to keep this right.
