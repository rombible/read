            <P><B>ACCESS</B><P> ak'-ses (prosagoge, "a leading to or toward," "approach"):
<P> Thrice used in the New Testament to indicate the acceptable way of approach to God and of admission to His favor. Jesus said, "I am the way" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+14:6">John 14:6</A>). His blood is the "new and living way" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+10:20">Hebrews 10:20</A>). Only through Him have we "access by faith into this grace wherein we stand" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</A>); "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+2:18">Ephesians 2:18</A> the King James Version); "in whom we have .... access in confidence, through our faith in him" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</A>).
<P> The goal of redemption is life in God, "unto the Father." The means of redemption is the cross of Christ, "in whom we have our redemption through his blood" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</A>). The agent in redemption is the Holy Spirit, "by one Spirit," "sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</A>). The human instrumentality, faith. The whole process of approach to, and abiding fellowship with, God is summed up in this brief sentence Access to the Father, through Christ, by the Spirit, by faith.
