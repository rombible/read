It is situated among the hills which constitute the south ridges of Lebanon,just before they sink down into the plain of Esdraelon, (Mr. Merrill, in "Galilee in the Time of Christ" (1881), represents Nazareth in Christs time as a city (so always called in the New Testament) of 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants, of some importance and considerable antiquity, and not so insignificant and mean as has been represented. --ED.) Of the identification of the ancient site there can be no doubt. The name of the present village is <I>en-Nazirah</I> the same, therefore, as of old it is formed on a hill or mountain, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/4-29.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/4-29.html">Luke 4:29</a> ) it is within the limits of the province of Galilee, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/1-9.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/1-9.html">Mark 1:9</a> ) it is near Cana, according to the implication in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/2-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/2-1.html">John 2:1</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/2-2.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/2-2.html">John 2:2</a>  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/2-11.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/2-11.html">John 2:11</a> ) a precipice exists in the neighborhood. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/4-29.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/4-29.html">Luke 4:29</a> ) The modern Nazareth belongs to the better class of eastern villages. It has a population of 3000 or 4000; a few are Mohammadans, the rest Latin and Greek Christians. (Near this town Napoleon once encamped (1799), after the battle of Mount Tabor.) The origin of the disrepute in which Nazareth stood, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/1-47.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/1-47.html">John 1:47</a> ) is not certainly known. All the inhabitants of Galilee were looked upon with contempt by the people of Judea because they spoke a ruder dialect, were less cultivated and were more exposed by their position to contact with the heathen. But Nazareth labored under a special opprobrium, for it was a Galilean and not a southern Jew who asked the reproachful question whether "any good thing" could come from that source. Above the town are several rocky ledges, over which a person could not be thrown without almost certain destruction. There is one very remarkable precipice, almost perpendicular and forty or fifty near the Maronite church, which may well be supposed to be the identical one over which his infuriated fellow townsmen attempted to hurl Jesus. </FONT></body></html>
