            <P><B>WEIGHT</B><P> wat (Measure of quantity) mishqal, (mishqol (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+4:10">Ezekiel 4:10</A>), from shaqkal, "to weigh" 'ebhen, "a stone" used for weighing in the balance):
<P> Weights were commonly of stone or bronze (or of lead, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+5:7,8">Zechariah 5:7,8</A>). They were of various forms, such as the lion-shaped weights of Babylonia and Assyria, or in the form of birds and other animals. The Hebrew and Phoenician weights, when made of stone, were barrel-shaped or spindle-shaped, but in bronze they were often cubical or octagonal or with numerous faces (see illustration under WEIGHTS AND MEASURES). Hemispherical or dome-shaped stone weights have been found in Palestine (PEFS, 1902, p. 344; 1903, p. 117; 1904, p. 209).
<P> Figurative:
<P> The phrase "without weight" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+25:16">2&nbsp;Kings 25:16</A>) signifies a quantity too great to be estimated. "Weight of glory" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+4:17">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:17</A>, baros) has a similar meaning, but with a spiritual reference. "Weighty," "weightier" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+10:10">2&nbsp;Corinthians 10:10</A>, barus, baruteros), signify what is important. The Greek (ogkos) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</A>), is used in the sense of burden, hindrance, as is also the Hebrew neTel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+27:3">Proverbs 27:3</A>).
