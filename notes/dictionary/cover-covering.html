            <P><B>COVER; COVERING</B><P> kuv'-er, kuv'-er-ing:
<P> The translation of several Hebrew words. The covering of the ark (mikhceh, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+8:13">Genesis 8:13</A>) was possibly the lid of a hatchway (compare Mitchell, World before Abraham, 215).
<P> To the sons of Kohath was assigned the task of caring for the furniture of the Tabernacle whenever the camp was moved, a suitable covering (kacah) of sealskin being designated for each of the specially sacred objects, the temple curtains also being used (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+4:8,9,11,12">Numbers 4:8,9,11,12</A>).
<P><P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+19:15">Numbers 19:15</A> (tsamidh) may refer to anything used as a lid or covering; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+24:7">Job 24:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+31:19">31:19</A> (kecuth) refer to clothing or bed-covering.
<P> Figurative:
<P> "Abaddon hath no covering"; (kecuth) from God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+26:6">Job 26:6</A>); "He will destroy .... the face of the covering (ha-loT) that covereth all peoples" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+25:7">Isaiah 25:7</A>). The removal of the veil, often worn as a token of mourning (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+19:4">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:4</A>), signified the destruction of death.
