            <P><B>ALOTH</B><P> a'-loth (`aloth):
<P> So found in the King James Version and the Revised Version, margin in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:16" target="_blank">1&nbsp;Kings 4:16</A>, where the Revised Version (British and American) has <a href="bealoth.html">BEALOTH</a> (be`aloth). A town, or district in northern Palestine, together with Asher under Baana, one of Solomon's twelve civil officers. Conder identifies with the ruin `Alia, near Achzib. There was another Bealoth in southern Palestine (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:24">Joshua 15:24</A>). The difference in the form of the word in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) is due to interpretation of the initial "b" as the preposition "in" in the former, and as part of the word itself in the latter.
