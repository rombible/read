Here alone, among all the Greek cities visited by St. Paul, we read expressly of "synagogues" in the plural, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-5.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/13-5.html">Acts 13:5</a> ) hence we conclude that there were many Jews in Cyprus. And this is in harmony with what we read elsewhere. Salamis was not far from the modern <I>Famagousta</I> , it was situated near a river called the Pediaeus, on low ground, which is in fact a continuation of the plain running up into the interior toward the place where <I>Nicosia</I> , the present capital of Cyprus, stands. </FONT></body></html>
