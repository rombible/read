            <P><B>TOPHEL</B><P> to'-fel (tophel; Tophol):
<P> This name is found in a passage with many difficulties (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+1:1">Deuteronomy 1:1</A>). The verse ostensibly makes clearer the position occupied by the camp of Israel where Moses addressed the people, by reference to certain other places which might be presumed to be better known. Not one of them, however, has been satisfactorily identified. Some think Tophel may be represented by the modern et-tafeleh, 15 miles Southeast of the Dead Sea, on the caravan road from Petra to Kerak. Apart from the question of position, the change of "t" to "T" is not easily explained. Meantime we must suspend judgment.
