            <P><B>ANATHOTH</B><P> an'-a-thoth (`anathoth; Anathoth):
<P> A town which lay between Michmash and Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+10:30">Isaiah 10:30</A>), in the territory of Benjamin, assigned to the Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:18">Joshua 21:18</A>). It was the native place of Abiathar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+2:26">1&nbsp;Kings 2:26</A>), and of the prophet Jer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+1:1">Jeremiah 1:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+11:21">11:21</A>, etc.). Here lay the field which, under remarkable circumstances, the prophet purchased (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+32:7">Jeremiah 32:7</A>). Two of David's distinguished soldiers, Abiezer (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+23:27">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:27</A>) and Jehu (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+12:3">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:3</A>), also hailed from Anathoth. It was again occupied by the Benjamites after the return from the Exile (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:32">Nehemiah 11:32</A>, etc.). It is identified with `Anata, two and a quarter miles Northeast of Jerusalem, a small village of some fifteen houses with remains of ancient walls. There are quarries in the neighborhood from which stones are still carried to Jerusalem. It commands a spacious outlook over the uplands to the North, and especially to the Southeast, over the Jordan valley toward the Dead Sea and the mountains of Moab. There is nothing to shelter it from the withering power of the winds from the eastern deserts (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+4:11">Jeremiah 4:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+18:17">18:17</A>, etc.).
