            <P><B>TROW</B><P> tro:
<P> An obsolete verb meaning "to believe"; compare "trust" and the German trauen. It occurs only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+17:9">Luke 17:9</A>, the King James Version "Doth he thank that servant. ...? I trow not," as a translation of ou doko, "I believe not." The words ou doko, however, are not part of the original text, but are a later gloss to supply an answer to the question, and hence, "I trow not" is omitted by the Revised Version (British and American).
