            <P><B>GIBBETHON</B><P> gib'-e-thon (gibbethon):
<P> A city in the territory of Da in the plain named with Eltekeh and Baalath (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:44">Joshua 19:44</A>), and assigned to the Kohathite Levites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+21:23">Joshua 21:23</A>). Later we find it in the hands of the Philistines; and it was while besieging the city that Nadab was slain by Baasha (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+15:27">1&nbsp;Kings 15:27</A>). After 25 years Omri, the general of Baasha, was here made king of the army when news reached them of Zimri s regicide (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+16:15">1&nbsp;Kings 16:15</A>). It may possibly be identified with Kibbiah, which lies about 16 miles Southeast of Jaffa; but no certain identification is possible.
