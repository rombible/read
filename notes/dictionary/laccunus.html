            <P><B>LACCUNUS</B><P> lak'-u-nus (Lakkounos; the King James Version Lacunus):
<P> One of the sons of Addi who returned with Ezra and had married a foreign wife (1 Esdras 9:31). The name does not, as might have been expected, occur in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+10:30">Ezra 10:30</A>. See note on the passage (in Lange's Commentary) as to the reconciliation of the lists in 1 Esdras and Ezra.
