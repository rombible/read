            <P><B>LORD OF HOSTS</B><P> A name or title of God frequently used in the Old Testament, always translated "Yahweh of Hosts" (Yahweh tsebha'oth) in the American Standard Revised Version, since Yahweh, never 'Adhonay, is used in this phrase. Evidently the meaning of the title is that all created agencies and forces are under the leadership or dominion of Yahweh, who made and maintains them (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:1">Genesis 2:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+45:12">Isaiah 45:12</A>). It is used to express Yahweh's great power.
<P> See GOD, NAMES OF, III, 8.
