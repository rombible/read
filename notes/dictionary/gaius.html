            <P><B>GAIUS</B><P> ga'-yus (Gaios; Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek, Gaios):
<P> (1) The Gaius to whom 3 Joh is addressed. He is spoken of as "the beloved" (3<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:1,2,5,11">John 1:1,2,5,11</A>), "walking in the truth" (3<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:3,4">John 1:3,4</A>), and doing "a faithful work" "toward them that are brethren and strangers withal" (3<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+1:5,6">John 1:5,6</A>). He has been identified by some with the Gaius mentioned in the Apostolical Constitutions (VII, 46), as having been appointed bishop of Pergamum by John.
<P> (2) Gaius of Macedonia, a "companion in travel" of Paul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</A>). He was one of those who were seized by Demetrius and the other silversmiths in the riot at Ephesus, during Paul's third missionary journey.
<P> (3) Gaius of Derbe, who was among those who accompanied Paul from Greece "as far as Asia," during his third missionary journey (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</A>). In the corresponding list given in the "Contendings of Paul" (compare Budge, Contendings of the Twelve Apostles, II, 592), the name of this Gaius is given as "Gallius."
<P> (4) Gaius, the host of Paul when he wrote the Epistle to the Roman, and who joined in sending his salutations (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</A>). As Paul wrote this epistle from Corinth, it is probable that this Gaius is identical with (5).
<P> (5) Gaius, whom Paul baptized at Corinth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+1:14">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:14</A>).
<P> C. M. Kerr
