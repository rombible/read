<P> For the King James Version "the tower of Syene," in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+29:10">Ezekiel 29:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+30:6">30:6</A>, the Revised Version (British and American) reads, "the tower of Seveneh," with a marginal note, "or, from Migdol to Syene." Seveneh is the town at the First Cataract in Egypt, now known as Assuan. Fresh interest has recently been given to it by the Elephantine discoveries bearing on the ancient Jewish colony and temple of Yahweh in that place in the 5th century BC.
