<P> Only once is this word found in our English Bible (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1co+14:40">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:40</A>). It is in the last verse of that remarkable chapter on the proper use of spiritual gifts in the church and the proper conduct of public worship. It does not refer here to absence of impurity or obscenity. It rather refers to good order in the conduct of public worship. All things that are done and said in public worship are to be in harmony with that becoming and reverent spirit and tone that befit the true worshippers of God.
