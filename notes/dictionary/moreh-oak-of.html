<P> It seems probable that the place here intended may be the same as that mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+11:30" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 11:30</A> ('elone moreh, "terebinths of Moreh," the King James Version "plains," the Revised Version (British and American) "oaks," the Revised Version margin "terebinths"). Both are defined as near to Shechem. The position cannot be identified today. The tree or trees were evidently a place of resort for those who wished to consult a moreh. See <a href="moreh-hill-of.html">MOREH, HILL OF</a>. To this day in Palestine trees are often regarded with a certain religious awe as the habitation of spirits. Isolated terebinths receive much veneration. The present writer has often seen such trees with multitudinous rags of all colors attached to them by the peasantry as evidence of their homage.
