            <P><B>INTREAT; INTREATY; (ENTREAT)</B><P> in-tret', in-tret'-i:
<P> The two forms are derived from the same verb. In 1611 the spelling was indifferently "intreat" or "entreat." In editions of the King James Version since 1760 "intreat" is used in the sense of "to beg"; "entreat" in the sense of "deal with." As examples of "intreat" see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+8:8">Exodus 8:8</A>, "Intreat the Lord" (tsa`aq); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+1:16">Ruth 1:16</A>, "Intreat me not to leave thee" (pagha`); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+8:4">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:4</A>, "praying us with much entreaty" paraklesis). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+25:21">Genesis 25:21</A> "intreat" is used to indicate the success of a petition. For entreat see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+12:16">Genesis 12:16</A>, "He entreated Abraham well"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:3">Acts 27:3</A>, "And Julius courteously entreated Paul" (philanthropos chresamenos, literally, "to use in a philanthropic way"); compare also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jas+3:17">James 3:17</A>, where eupeithes, literally, "easily persuaded," is translated "easy to be entreated."
<P> The Revised Version changes all passages of the King James Version where "intreat" is found to "entreat," with the exception of those mentioned below. The meaning of "entreat" is "to ask," "to beseech," "to supplicate":
<P> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+19:17">Job 19:17</A> reads "and my supplication to the children" (hannothi, the King James Version "though I entreated for the children," the Revised Version, margin "I make supplication"). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+15:11">Jeremiah 15:11</A> reads, "I will cause the enemy to make supplication" (hiphga'ti), instead, the King James Version "I will cause the enemy to entreat" (the Revised Version margin "I will intercede for thee with the enemy"). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:1">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:1</A> changes the King James Version "intreat" to "exhort." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</A> renders the King James Version "entreat" by "beseech."
