            <P><B>ANGLE</B><P> an'-g'-l:
<P> Used in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+19:8">Isaiah 19:8</A> for a Hebrew noun that is rendered "hook" in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:1">Job 41:1</A>: "The fishers shall lament, and all they that cast angle (hook) into the Nile shall mourn." For a striking figurative use of it see <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=hab+1:15">Habakkuk 1:15</A> where, speaking of the wicked devouring the righteous, "making men as the fishes of the sea," the prophet says: "They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net" (the Revised Version (British and American) uses singular).
