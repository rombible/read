            <P><B>JAIRUS (2)</B><P> ja'-i-rus, ja-i'-rus (Iaeiros):
<P> A ruler in a synagogue near Capernaum whose only daughter, aged about 12 years, was raised from the dead by Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+9:18-26">Matthew 9:18-26</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+5:22-43">Mark 5:22-43</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+8:41-56">Luke 8:41-56</A>). The accounts of the miracle are substantially the same, but vary in detail. According to Mark and Luke the arrival of Jairus in Capernaum fell immediately after the return of Jesus from Gadara, but according to Matthew the sequence of events was that Jesus had returned to Capernaum, had called Matthew, had joined the feast of the publicans, and had just finished His discourse on fasting when Jairus came to Him. Matthew and Mark both testify to the great faith of Jairus, who besought of Jesus that He should but lay His hand upon the maid and she should live. According to Matthew she was already dead when Jairus came to Capernaum; according to the others she was on the point of death; but all agree as to her death before the arrival of Jesus and His followers at her abode. Matthew implies that Jesus alone was present at the actual raising; Mark and Luke state that Peter, James, John and the parents were also there. The healing of the woman with the issue of blood by Jesus on the way is given by all.
