            <P><B>WENCH</B><P> wench, wensh (shiphchah):
<P> The word "wench" is found only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+17:17">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:17</A> the King James Version, where the Revised Version (British and American) has "maid-servant." The Hebrew word shiphchah here used is a common term for maid-servant, female slave. the King James Version used the word "wench" to convey the meaning maid-servant, which was a common use of the word at that time, but it is now practically obsolete.
