            <P><B>CONSORT</B><P> kon-sort' (proskleroo, "to allot," <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</A>). The verb may be either in the middle or passive voice. the Revised Version (British and American), the King James Version, and Luther's German translation regard it as middle, and render it:
<P> "cast their lots with," "associated," "united with." In advocacy of the passive, see Alford's Greek Testament, proposing: "were added," as if by lot, the allotment eing determined by God who gave them the Holy Spirit directing their choice. The English has the Latin for "lot" as its base.
