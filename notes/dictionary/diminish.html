            <P><B>DIMINISH</B><P> di-min'-ish:
<P> the Revised Version (British and American) has retained nearly all passages of the King James Version where "to diminish" is used. Some of these uses have become obsolete: <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+4:2">Deuteronomy 4:2</A>, "neither shall ye diminish from it." "Diminish" generally means "to reduce," "to lessen." In this sense it is employed in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+5:11">Ezekiel 5:11</A> from the Hebrew gara`, literally, "to shear." The picture of shearing the beard, expressing degradation and loss of manhood, may underlie this passage.
