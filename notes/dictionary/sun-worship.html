            <P><B>SUN-WORSHIP</B><P> sun'-wur-ship:
<P> The splendor of the sun makes it a natural object of adoration, once the purer idea of the one true God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+1:20,21">Romans 1:20,21</A>) is parted with, and in most ancient nations the worship of the sun was an outstanding feature. It is found in Babylonian and Assyrian (Samas; special seats of sun-worship were Sippara and Larsa); in Egypt it is a leading feature of the religion (Ra, and, under special phases, Horus, Tum, Aten; a special seat of sun-worship was Heliopollis, the Old Testament On, called in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+43:13">Jeremiah 43:13</A> Beth-shemesh, "house of the sun"). Other cities bore the same name: Beth-shemesh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:10">Joshua 15:10</A> = Ir-shemesh; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:41">Joshua 19:41</A>, in Judah; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:22">Joshua 19:22</A>, in Issachar; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:38">Joshua 19:38</A>, in Naphtali; see BETH-SHEMESH). Allusions to, and warnings against, sun-worship are frequent in the Old Testament, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+26:30">Leviticus 26:30</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+14:5">2&nbsp;Chronicles 14:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:4,7">34:4,7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+17:8">Isaiah 17:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+27:9">27:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+6:4,6">Ezekiel 6:4,6</A>, in which passages for the King James Version "images," "idols," the Revised Version (British and American) has "sun-images" (which see); <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+31:26,27">Job 31:26,27</A> and numerous passages show that this form of idolatry latterly penetrated deeply into Judah--even into its temple-worship (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:5,11">2&nbsp;Kings 23:5,11</A>, "horses .... given to the sun" (see under HORSES OF THE SUN,
<P> "Chariots of the Sun"); and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+8:16">Ezekiel 8:16</A>). Josiah's reformation took account of these abuses (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+23:5,11">2&nbsp;Kings 23:5,11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+34:4,7">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:4,7</A>), and Ezekiel strenuously denounced them (8:16).
