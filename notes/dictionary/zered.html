            <P><B>ZERED</B><P> ze'-red (zeredh; Codex Vaticanus Zaret; Codex Alexandrinus Zare; the King James Version, Zared (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:12">Numbers 21:12</A>)):
<P> This is the nachal or "torrent valley" given as the place where Israel encamped before they reached the Arnon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:12">Numbers 21:12</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+2:13">Deuteronomy 2:13</A>, the crossing of the brook Zered marks the end of the 38 years' desert wanderings. It has often been identified with Wady el-`Achsa, which runs up from the southeastern corner of the Dead Sea. A fatal objection to this is that the host had entered the wilderness to the East of Moab before they crossed the Zered (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+21:11">Numbers 21:11</A>), while Wady el-`Achsa must have formed the southern boundary of Moab. We may conclude with certainty that one of the confluents of Wady Kerak is intended, but which, it is impossible now to say.
