<P> Occurs (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+3:23">Colossians 3:23</A>) as the translation of ek psuches, "out of the soul," "Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily as unto the Lord (who sees the heart and recompenses "whatsoever good thing a man does") and not unto men" (however they, your masters according to the flesh, may regard it); the Revised Version (British and American) "work heartily," margin (Greek) "from the soul."
<P> In 2 Macc 4:37, we have "Antiochus was heartily sorry," psuchikos ("from the soul").
