            <P><B>TOWER OF LEBANON</B><P> (mighdal ha-lebhanon):
<P> (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+7:4">Song of Solomon 7:4</A>)): The designation "which looketh toward Damascus" compels us to identify it with some portion of, or something in, the eastern range of "Lebanon, toward the sun-rising" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:5">Joshua 13:5</A>). It would then of necessity correspond to the chief summit of Hermon, on which there has been from ancient times also a tower-like temple, and from which the view is almost of boundless extent, Damascus with its gardens and groves being surprisingly near and appearing like a beautiful island in a wide extended sea.
<P> See LEBANON.
