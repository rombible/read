            <P><B>PURPOSE, OF GOD</B><P> pur'-pus (prothesis (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</A>)):
<P> The word "purpose" seems to be an equivalent of the word "decree" as used in regard to man's relation to eternity. More correctly stated, it softens the word "decree" and refers back to the cause of the decree as lodged in an intelligent design and forward to an aim consistent with the character of God.
<P> See FOREORDAIN; PREDESTINATION.
