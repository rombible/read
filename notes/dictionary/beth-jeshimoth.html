            <P><B>BETH-JESHIMOTH</B><P> beth-jesh'-i-moth (beth ha-yeshimoth; Codex Vaticanus, Haisimoth; Codex Alexandrinus, Asimoth, and other variants (see DB, under the word)):
<P> Mentioned as the point in the south from which the camp of Israel stretched to Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+33:49">Numbers 33:49</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+12:3">Joshua 12:3</A> the way to Beth-jeshimoth is described as South of the Arabah, near the Dead Sea. It was in the lot assigned to Reuben (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+13:20">Joshua 13:20</A>), At what times and how long it was actually held by Israel we do not know; but it appears in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+25:9">Ezekiel 25:9</A> as belonging to Moab. It may be identical with Khirbet es-Suweimeh, where there are some ruins and a well, about 3 miles East of the mouth of the Jordan.
