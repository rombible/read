( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-64.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-64.html">Genesis 24:64</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/3-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/3-3.html">Jeremiah 3:3</a> ) The custom among many Oriental nations both of coloring the face and forehead and of impressing on the body marks indicative of devotion to some special deity or religious sect is mentioned elsewhere. The "jewels for the forehead," mentioned by Ezekiel, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/16-12.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/16-12.html">Ezekiel 16:12</a> ) and in margin of Authorized Version, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-22.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/24-22.html">Genesis 24:22</a> ) were in all probability nose-rings.
