            <P><B>BDELLIUM</B><P> del'-i-um (bedholach):
<P> The word occurs twice in the Pentateuch:
<P>  (1) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+2:12" target="_blank">Genesis 2:12</A>, in conjunction with gold and onyx, as a product of the land of <a href="havilah.html">HAVILAH</a> (which see), and
<P>  (2) in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+11:7">Numbers 11:7</A>, where the manna is likened to this substance in appearance:
<P> "The appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium." The latter comparison excludes the idea of bedholach being a precious stone, and points to the identification of it with the fragrant resinous gum known to the Greeks as bdellion, several kinds being mentioned by Dioscorides and Pliny. It was a product of Arabia, India, Afghanistan, etc.
