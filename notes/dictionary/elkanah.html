            <P><B>ELKANAH</B><P> el-ka'-na ('elqanah, "God has possessed"):
<P> (1) An Ephraimite, the father of Samuel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+1:1-28">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:1-28</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+2:11-20">2:11-20</A>). Of his two wives, Hannah, the childless, was best beloved. At Shiloh she received through Eli the promise of a son. Elkanah, with Hannah, took the young Samuel to Shiloh when he was weaned, and left him with EIi as their offering to Yahweh. They were blessed with three other sons and two daughters.
<P> (2) The second son of Korah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+6:24">Exodus 6:24</A>), who escaped the fate of Korah, Dathan and Abiram (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+26:11">Numbers 26:11</A>).
<P> (3) One "next to the king" in Jerusalem in the time of Ahaz; slain by one Zichri of Ephraim in war with Pekah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+28:7">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:7</A>).

<P> (7) Another Levite, ancestor of Berechiah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:16">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:16</A>).
<P> (8) Another Levite (if not the same as (4) above), one of the "doorkeepers for the ark" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+15:23">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:23</A>).
