            <P><B>CONFECTION; CONFECTIONARY</B><P> kon-fek'-shun, kon-fek'-shun-a-ri (roqach "perfume," "spice," raqqahah, feminine "perfumer"):
<P> (1) "Confection" is found in the King James Version only and but once "a confection after the art of the apothecary" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+30:35">Exodus 30:35</A>; the Revised Version (British and American) "perfume"); but the Revised Version (British and American) renders <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:30">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:30</A>, "the confection (the King James Version "ointment") of the spices." It stands for something "made up," a mixture of perfumes or medicines, but never sweetmeats, as confection means with us.
<P> (2) Likewise a "confectionary" is a perfumer. This word, too, is found but once (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+8:13">1&nbsp;Samuel 8:13</A>), "He will take your daughters to be perfumers (the King James Version "confectionaries"), and to be cooks, and to be bakers."
