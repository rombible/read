            <P><B>MIRIAM</B><P> mir'-i-am (miryam; Septuagint and the New Testament Mariam; English Versions of the Bible of the New Testament "Mary"):
<P> (1) Daughter of Amram and Jochebed, and sister of Aaron and Moses. It is probable that it was she who watched the ark of bulrushes in which the child Moses was laid (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+2:4">Exodus 2:4</A>). She associated herself with her brothers in the exodus, is called "the prophetess," and led the choir of maidens who sang the triumph-song after the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+15:20">Exodus 15:20</A>). Along with Aaron, she opposed Moses at Hazeroth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+12:1-5">Numbers 12:1-5</A>). She was smitten with leprosy in punishment, but on Aaron's intercession was pardoned and healed (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+12:10-15">Numbers 12:10-15</A>). She died and was buried at Kadesh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+20:1">Numbers 20:1</A>). In the Deuteronomic Law respecting leprosy, Miriam is mentioned as a warning to the Israelites (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+24:8">Deuteronomy 24:8</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+6:4">Micah 6:4</A>, she is referred to along with Moses and Aaron as a leader of God's people.
<P> (2) Son (or daughter) of Jether (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:17">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:17</A>). The latter half of the verse is in its present situation unintelligible; it should probably follow verse 18 (see Curtis, Chronicles, in the place cited.).
