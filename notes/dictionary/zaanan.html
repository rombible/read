            <P><B>ZAANAN</B><P> za'-a-nan (tsa`anan; Sennaar):
<P> A place named by Micah in the Shephelah of Judah (1:11). In this sentence the prophet makes verbal play with the name, as if it were derived from yatsa', "to go forth": "The inhabitant (margin "inhabitress") of tsa'anan is not come forth" (yatse'ah). The place is not identical. It is probably the same as ZENAN.
