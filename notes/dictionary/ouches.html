            <P><B>OUCHES</B><P> ouch'-ez, -iz (mishbetsoth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+28:11,13,14,25">Exodus 28:11,13,14,25</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:6,13,16,18">39:6,13,16,18</A>) the American Standard Revised Version "settings," but in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:13">Exodus 39:13</A>, "inclosings"):
<P> The secondary meaning of this now archaic word is the gold or silver setting of a precious stone. In Exodus, where it occurs 8 times, it is clear that the gold settings of the engraved stones forming the breast-plate of the high priest are intended; the onyx stones forming the fibula or brooch for holding together the two sides of the breast-plate being said to be "enclosed in ouches (settings) of gold" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:6">Exodus 39:6</A>). Not only were these two onyx or beryl stones so set, but the 12 stones forming the front of the breast-plate were "inclosed in gold in their settings" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+28:20">Exodus 28:20</A>). The same word occurs in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+45:13">Psalms 45:13</A>, where the king's daughter is said to have her clothing "in-wrought with gold," i.e. embroidered with gold thread or wire. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:3">Exodus 39:3</A> tells us how this wire was produced. From this fact it may be inferred that the settings of the breast-plate were not solid pieces of gold, but were formed of woven wire wreathed round the stones, in a sort of filigree.
