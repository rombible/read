            <P><B>LADE; LADING</B><P> lad, lad'-ing:
<P> "To lade" in the sense of "to load" is retained by the Revised Version (British and American) in nearly all passages where the word occurs in the King James Version (but compare the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) reading of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+68:19">Psalms 68:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+46:1">Isaiah 46:1</A>), "They laded us with such things" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+28:10">Acts 28:10</A> the King James Version). The epithithemi, "to put on," is rendered by the Revised Version (British and American), "They put on board such things." <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=lu+11:46">Luke 11:46</A> the Revised Version (British and American) reads "ye load" instead of the King James Version "ye lade."
<P> Lading (phortion) is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:10">Acts 27:10</A> in its usual meaning, "the lading of a ship."
