            <P><B>LAPPIDOTH</B><P> lap'-i-doth, -doth (lappidhoth, "flames," "torches"; the King James Version, Lapidoth):
<P> Deborah's husband (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+4:4">Judges 4:4</A>). The Hebrew name is a feminine plural like Jeremoth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:8">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:8</A>), Naboth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+21:1">1&nbsp;Kings 21:1</A>). The plural is probably intensive. Jewish interpreters have identified Lappidoth ("flames") with Barak ("lightning"). Some have taken the words rendered "wife of Lappidoth" ('esheth lappidhoth) as a description of Deborah, and have translated them, "woman of lights," i.e. maker of wicks for the sanctuary; or "woman of flames," referring to her prophetic zeal. These explanations are more interesting than probable.
