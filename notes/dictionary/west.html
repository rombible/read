            <P><B>WEST</B><P> (1) Usually (yam), "sea" because the Mediterranean lies to the West of Palestine; not usually in figurative expressions; but compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+11:10">Hosea 11:10</A>.
<P> (2) Often (ma`arabh); compare Arabic (gharb), and (maghrib), "west" (maghrib-ush-shems), or simply (maghrib), "sunset."
<P> (3) (mebho' ha-chemesh), "entrance of the sun," (mabho', bo'), "to come in." (Just as mizrach, is the rising of the sun, or east, so mabho' (or ma'arabh], is the setting of the sun, or west:
<P> "From the rising of the sun (mizrach-shemesh) unto the going down (mabho) thereof" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+50:1">Psalms 50:1</A>; compare 113:3; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mal+1:11">Malachi 1:11</A>).)
<P> (4) (dusme, from duo), "to enter," "sink," "set." The Greek usage is parallel to the Hebrew just cited:
<P> "Many shall come from the east anatole, "rising") and the west" (dusme, "setting") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</A>).
<P> The chief figurative use of the word "west" is in combination with "east" to denote great or infinite distance, as:
<P> "As far as the east is from the west,
<P> So far hath he removed our transgressions
<P> from us" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+103:12">Psalms 103:12</A>).
