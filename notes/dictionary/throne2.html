( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/17-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/17-18.html"> 17:18</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/1-46.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/1-46.html">1&nbsp;Kings 1:46</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/7-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/7-18.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 7:18</a> ) The characteristic feature in the royal throne was its elevation: Solomons throne was approached by six steps, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/10-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/10-19.html">1&nbsp;Kings 10:19</a> ;  <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/9-18.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/9-18.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:18</a> ) and Jehovahs throne is described as "high and lifted up." ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/6-1.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/6-1.html">Isaiah 6:1</a> ) The materials and workmanship of Solomons throne were costly. It was made of wood inlaid with ivory and then covered with gold except where the ivory showed. It was furnished with arms or "stays." The steps were also lines with pairs of lions. As to the form of chair, we are only informed in ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/10-19.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/10-19.html">1&nbsp;Kings 10:19</a> ) that "the top was round behind." The king sat on his throne on state occasions. At such times he appeared in his royal robes. The throne was the symbol of supreme power and dignity. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/41-40.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/41-40.html">Genesis 41:40</a> ) Similarly, "to sit upon the throne" implied the exercise of regal power.
