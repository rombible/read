            <P><B>AMMIHUD</B><P> a-mi'-hud (`ammihudh, "my kinsman is glorious"; variously in the Septuagint, Emioud or Semioud or Amioud):
<P> The name of several Old Testament persons.
<P> (1) Father of Elishama, who in the wilderness was head of the tribe of Ephraim (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+1:10">Numbers 1:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+2:18">2:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+7:48,53">7:48,53</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+10:22">10:22</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+7:26">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:26</A>).
<P> (2) Father of Shemuel, who was appointed by Moses from the tribe of Simeon to divide the land among the tribes after they should have entered Canaan (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:20">Numbers 34:20</A>).
<P> (3) Father of Pedahel, who was appointed from the tribe of Naphtali for the same purpose as the Ammihud of (2) (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=nu+34:28">Numbers 34:28</A>).
<P> (4) In the King James Version and the Revised Version, margin for the Ammihur (`ammichur,"my kinsman is noble"), who was father of Talmai of Geshur, a little Aramaic kingdom East of the Lebanon mountains, to whom Absalom fled after the murder of his brother Amnon. The weight of evidence seems to favor the reading Ammichur (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:37">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:37</A>).
<P> (5) A descendant of Judah through the line of Perez (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:4">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:4</A>).
