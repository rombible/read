            <P><B>ANSWER</B><P> an'-ser:
<P> In our English Bible the word "answer" does not always mean a simple reply to a question.
<P> 1. In the Old Testament:
<P> Six different words are translated by answer.
<P> (1) It is frequently used where no question has been asked and in such cases it means a word, a statement.
<P> (2) It also means a response (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+21:34">Job 21:34</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+34:36">34:36</A>).
<P> (3) It often means a declaration or proclamation from God where no question has been asked. See the many passages that read:
<P> "The Lord answered and said."
<P> (4) The other words translated "answer" or "answered" in the Old Testament are unimportant shadings and variations.
<P> 2. In the New Testament:
<P> The words translated "answer" are not so varied.
<P> (1) It sometimes means an apology, a defense (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1pe+3:15">1&nbsp;Peter 3:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+24:10,25">Acts 24:10,25</A>).
<P> (2) It may mean simply "to say" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mr+9:6">Mark 9:6</A>).
<P> (3) It may mean a revelation from God (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+11:4">Romans 11:4</A>).
<P> (4) It is also used to apply to unspoken thoughts of the heart, especially in the sayings of Jesus; also by Peter to Sapphira (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+5:8">Acts 5:8</A>).
