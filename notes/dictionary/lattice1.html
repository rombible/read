Perhaps the network through which Ahaziah fell and received his mortal injury was on the parapet of his palace.

It frequently projects from the wall (like our bay windows), and is formed of reticulated work, often highly ornamental, portions of which are hinged so that they may be opened or shut at pleasure. The object is to keep the apartments cool by intercepting the direct rays of the sun, while the air is permitted to circulate freely. --Fairbairn.
