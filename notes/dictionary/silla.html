            <P><B>SILLA</B><P> sil'-a (cilla'; Codex Vaticanus Galla; Codex Alexandrinus Gaallad):
<P> Joash was assassinated by his servants "at the house of Millo, on the way that goeth down to Silla" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+12:20">2&nbsp;Kings 12:20</A>). Wherever Beth-millo stood, Silla was evidently in the valley below it; but nothing is known of what it was or where it stood.
