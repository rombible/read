            <P><B>GARLAND</B><P> gar'-land (stemma, "wreath"):
<P> Mentioned only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+14:13">Acts 14:13</A>, where it is said that the priest of Jupiter brought oxen and garlands unto the gates with which to offer sacrifices unto Barnabas and Paul. The rendering "oxen and garlands," instead of "oxen garlanded," seems to imply that the garlands were for the priests and altar and worshippers themselves, as well as for the victims sacrificed. Only occasionally did the Hebrews use such ornaments for themselves, and that almost altogether in their later history.
<P> See CROWN.
