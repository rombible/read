            <P><B>EN-RIMMON</B><P> en-rim'-on (`en-rimmon, "the fountain of Rimmon" (see RIMMON), or perhaps "the spring of the pomegranate"; Eromoth, Rhemmon):
<P> A city of Judah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+15:32">Joshua 15:32</A>), "Ain and Rimmon"; ascribed to Simeon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+19:7">Joshua 19:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+4:32">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:32</A>, "Ain, Rimmon"). In
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+11:29">Nehemiah 11:29</A> mentioned as reinhabited after the Captivity. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+14:10">Zechariah 14:10</A>, runs:
<P> "All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem." It must have been a very southerly place. In the Eusebius, Onomasticon, ("Erimmon") it is described as a "very large village 16 miles South of Eleutheropolis." Kh. Umm er Rumamin, 9 miles North of Beersheba is the usually accepted site. See PEF, 398; Sh XXIV.
