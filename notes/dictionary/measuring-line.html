            <P><B>MEASURING LINE</B><P> (qaw, qeweh):
<P> The usual meaning is simply line, rope or cord, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:10,13">Isaiah 28:10,13</A>, but the line was used for measurement, as is evident from such passages as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+7:23">1&nbsp;Kings 7:23</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+38:5">Job 38:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+31:39">Jeremiah 31:39</A>. Whether the line for measuring had a definite length or not we have no means of knowing. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+44:13">Isaiah 44:13</A> it refers to the line used by the carpenter in marking the timber on which he is working, and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=zec+1:16">Zechariah 1:16</A> it refers to the builder's line.
<P> Figuratively:
<P> It signifies destruction, or a portion of something marked off by line for destruction, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+21:13">2&nbsp;Kings 21:13</A>; or for judgment, as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+28:17">Isaiah 28:17</A>.
<P> H. Porter
