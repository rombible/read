            <P><B>BROTH</B><P> broth (maraq):
<P> Equivalent to our "soup." When Gideon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+6:19">Judges 6:19</A>) made ready a kid, "the flesh he put in a basket," but, it is added, "he put the broth in a pot"; and he is told by the angel to "pour out the broth" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+6:20">Judges 6:20</A>). <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+65:4">Isaiah 65:4</A> makes Yahweh speak of rebellious Israel as "a people that provoke me to my face continually sacrificing in gardens," and adds in description "that eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels" (maraq, paraq).
