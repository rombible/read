            <P><B>CHANNEL</B><P> chan'-el ('aphiq (root 'aphaq, "to hold or contain," "to be strong"; compare Arabic 'afaq "to overcome" and 'afiq, "preeminent"); shibboleth (shabhal, "to go," "to go up or grow," "to flow"; compare Arabic 'asbal, "to flow," "to rain," "to put forth ears"; sabalat, "an ear of grain"; sabil, "a road," "a public fountain")):
<P> In
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+12:21">Job 12:21</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+40:18">40:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+41:15">41:15</A> we have 'aphiq in the sense of "strong" (but compare 40:18, the Revised Version (British and American) "tubes" (of brass)). Elsewhere it is translated "river," "brook," "stream," "channel" or "watercourse." Shibboleth (in the dialect of Ephraim cibboleth (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+12:6">Judges 12:6</A>)) means "an ear of grain" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+41:5">Genesis 41:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ru+2:2">Ruth 2:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+17:5">Isaiah 17:5</A>) or "a flood of water" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+69:2,15">Psalms 69:2,15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+27:12">Isaiah 27:12</A>). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+22:16">2&nbsp;Samuel 22:16</A> (compare
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+18:15">Psalms 18:15</A>) we have:
 - "Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils."
 + This is reminiscent of "fountains of the deep" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+7:11">Genesis 7:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+8:2">8:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=pr+8:28">Proverbs 8:28</A>). It is a question how far we should attribute to these ancient writers a share in modern notions of oceanography, but the idea seems to be that of a withdrawal of the water of the ocean, and the laying bare of submarine declivities and channels such as we know to exist as the result of erosion during a previous period of elevation, when the given portion of ocean floor was dry land.
<P> The fact that many streams of Palestine flow only during the rainy season seems to be referred to in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+6:15">Job 6:15</A>; and perhaps also in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+126:4">Psalms 126:4</A>.
