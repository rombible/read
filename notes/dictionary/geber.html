<P> (1) According to <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:13">1&nbsp;Kings 4:13</A> the King James Version the father of one of the 12 officers who provided food for Solomon and his household (but here the Revised Version (British and American) "Ben-geber"). His district lay to the Northeast of Jordan.
<P> (2) Another, and the last in the list of Solomon's commissariat officers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+4:19">1&nbsp;Kings 4:19</A>). His district was also East of the Jordan, but probably to the South of that named in connection with the official of 4:13 (the Revised Version (British and American) "Ben-geber"). According to the rendering of English Versions of the Bible, he is said to have been "the only officer that was in the land." Unless the text, which presents some difficulties, is corrupt, as some suppose, it probably means that this large region was assigned to one official because less able than the others to furnish the required supplies.
