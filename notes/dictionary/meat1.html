The latter is denoted uniformly by "flesh." The word "meat," when our English version was made, meant <I>food</I> in general; or if any particular kind was designated, it referred to meal, flour or grain. The only real and inconvenient ambiguity caused by the change which has taken place in the meaning of the word is in the case of the "meat offering."
