            <P><B>MOTION</B><P> mo'-shun:
<P> In 2 Esdras 6:14, the King James Version "motion" represents the Latin commotio, "commotion," "disturbance" (the Revised Version (British and American) has revised entirely here). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+7:5" target="_blank">Romans 7:5</A>, "the motions of sins, which were by the law," "motion" is used in the sense of "impulse," and "impulses" would probably give the best translation. But the Greek noun (pathemata) is hard to translate exactly, and the Revised Version (British and American) has preferred "passions," as in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ga+5:24">Galatians 5:24</A>. Sanday (ICC) paraphrases "the impressions of sense, suggestive of sin, stimulated into perverse activity by their legal prohibition." See <a href="passion-passions.html">PASSION</a>. "Motion" is found also in The Wisdom of Solomon 5:11 (the King James Version and the Revised Version margin) and The Wisdom of Solomon 7:24 (the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American)) in a modern sense.
