            <P><B>SIRAH, WELL OF</B><P> si'-ra (bor hacirah, "the pit," "well" or "cistern of Sarah"):
<P> The spot from which Abner was enticed back to Hebron to his death (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+3:26">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:26</A>). Josephus (Ant., VII, i, 5) calls it Be(r)sira, implying that it was a "well." It is possible that this spot is now `Ain Sarah, a spring which flows into a little tank near the west side of the road about a mile out of ancient Hebron, on the way to Jerusalem. There is, however, a curious cistern with steps known as Chamam Sarah ("Sarah's bath") near Ramet el-Khalil, which is also possibly the site (PEF, 314, Sh XXI).
