He led the forces of Assyria into Palestine, where Hoshea, the last king of Israel, had revolted against his authority. ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/17-3.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/17-3.html">2&nbsp;Kings 17:3</a> ) Hoshea submitted and consented to pay tribute; but he soon after concluded all alliance with the king of Egypt, and withheld his tribute in consequence. In B.C. 723 Shalmaneser invaded Palestine for the second time, and, as Hoshea refused to submit, laid siege to Samaria. The siege lasted to the third year, B.C. 721, when the Assyrian arms prevailed.
