            <P><B>BALDNESS</B><P> bald'-ness qorchah:
<P> The reference in the Bible to baldness is not to the natural loss of hair, but to baldness produced by shaving the head. This was practiced as a mark of mourning for the dead (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:5">Leviticus 21:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+15:2">Isaiah 15:2</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+22:12">22:12</A>); as the result of any disaster (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+8:10">Amos 8:10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+1:16">Micah 1:16</A>). The custom arose from the fact that the hair was regarded as a special ornament. It was the custom of the people of the land, and the Israelites were strictly forbidden to practice it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+21:5">Leviticus 21:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:1">Deuteronomy 14:1</A>). These are striking passages with reference to the knowledge the Israelites had concerning the future life. This is saying to them what Paul said to the Thessalonians (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+4:13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:13</A>). To call one a "bald head" was an epithet of contempt, and was sometimes applied to persons who were not naturally bald. It was the epithet applied by certain infidel young men to Elisha (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+2:23,24">2&nbsp;Kings 2:23,24</A>). In a figurative sense it is used to express the barrenness of the country (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+47:5">Jeremiah 47:5</A>).
