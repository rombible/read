            <P><B>CONTROVERSY</B><P> kon'-tro-ver-si (ribh, "strife," "contention"; homologoumenos, "confessedly," "without controversy"):
<P> Used frequently of disputes among men (as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+17:8">Deuteronomy 17:8</A>) and then transferred to the justice of God as directed against the sins of men. Thus we read of Yahweh's controversy with the nations (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+25:31">Jeremiah 25:31</A>); with the inhabitants of the land (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ho+4:1">Hosea 4:1</A>); with His people (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+6:2">Micah 6:2</A>). "Without controversy" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+3:16">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:16</A>), a positive rather than a negative expression, "by common consent," or better, "as unanimously confessed," introducing a quotation from a hymn or rhythmical confession of the early church.
