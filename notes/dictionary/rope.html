            <P><B>ROPE</B><P> rop:
<P> Used in the Old Testament for chebhel, "that which binds" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+17:13">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:13</A>, etc.), and for `abhoth, "that which is woven" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+15:13">Judges 15:13</A>, etc.). In neither word is any specified thickness or strength connoted, and chebhel is translated equally well by "line" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+8:2">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:2</A>, etc.) or "cord" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+2:15">Joshua 2:15</A>, etc.), and `abhoth by "cord" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+118:27">Psalms 118:27</A>, etc.), as best suits the context. Similarly in the New Testament the word schoinion, literally, "made of rushes" can mean the rope by which a boat is fastened (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+27:32">Acts 27:32</A>) or small cords suitable for a whip (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+2:15">John 2:15</A>). The usual material for ropes was certainly flax (hemp), but the Egyptians, and so possibly the Hebrews, at times made ropes of leathern thongs.
<P> See CORD; LINE; SHIPS AND BOATS, III, 2.
