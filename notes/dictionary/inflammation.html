<P> Only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+28:22" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 28:22</A>, was considered by Jewish writers as "burning fever," by Septuagint as a form of ague. Both this and typhoid fever are now, and probably were, among the commonest of the diseases of Palestine. See <a href="fever.html">FEVER</a>. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+13:28">Leviticus 13:28</A> the King James Version has "inflammation" as the rendering of tsarebheth, which Septuagint reads charakter, and for which the proper English equivalent is "scar," as in the Revised Version (British and American).
