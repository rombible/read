            <P><B>TAHASH</B><P> ta'-hash (tachash; Tochos; the King James Version Thahash):
<P> A son of Nahor by his concubine Reumah (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+22:24">Genesis 22:24</A>). The word tachash means a kind of leather or skin, and perhaps the animal yielding it, probably the "dugong" (compare Brown, Briggs, and Driver). Tachash has been identified by Winckler with Tichis (Egypt), located on the Orontes, North of Kadesh.
