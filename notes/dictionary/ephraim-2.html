            <P><B>EPHRAIM (2)</B><P> (1) A position apparently of some importance, since the position of Baal-hazor (probably = Tell `Asur) where Abraham's sheep- farm was located, is determined by relation to it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:23">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:23</A>). That it lay North of Jerusalem seems to be indicated in
 <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+13:34">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:34</A>. It may be identical with the Ephraim of Eusebius, Onomasticon, 20 Roman miles North of Jerusalem, and therefore to be sought somewhere in the neighborhood of Sinjil and el- Lubban. Connected with this may have been the name Aphaerema, a district in Samaria mentioned in 1 Macc 11:34; Ant, XIII, iv, 9.
<P> (2) The town near the wilderness to which Jesus retired after the raising of Lazarus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+11:54">John 11:54</A>). This probably corresponds to Ephrem of Eusebius, Onomasticon (s .v. "Afra") 5 Roman miles East of Bethel. This may be the place named along with Bethel by Josephus (BJ, IV, ix, 9). It probably answers to eT-Taiyebeh, a large village about 4 miles North of Beitin. The antiquity of the site is attested by the cisterns and rock tombs. It stands on a high hill with a wide outlook including the plains of Jericho and the Dead Sea.
