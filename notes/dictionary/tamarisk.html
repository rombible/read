<P> (1) 'eshel (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+21:33">Genesis 21:33</A>, the King James Version "grove," margin "tree"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+22:6">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:6</A>, the King James Version "tree," margin "grove"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+31:13">1&nbsp;Samuel 31:13</A>, the King James Version "tree"). The Revised Version (British and American) translation is due to the similarity of 'eshel to the Arabic 'athl, "the tamarisk."

<P> The tamarisk (Tamarix, with various species in Palestine, chiefly T. Syriaca) is a very characteristic tree of Palestine, especially in the Maritime Plain, near the sea itself, and in the Jordan Valley. Eight species are described. They are characterized by their brittle, feathery branches and by their tiny scale-like leaves. Some varieties flourish not infrequently in salty soil unsuited to any ordinary vegetation.
