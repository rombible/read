            <P><B>RAAMIAH</B><P> ra-a-mi'-a (ra`amyah; Codex Vaticanus Naamia; Codex Alexandrinus, Rheelma):
<P> One of the leading men who returned with Zerubbabel from captivity (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ne+7:7">Nehemiah 7:7</A>). In the corresponding passage in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ezr+2:2">Ezra 2:2</A>, where the same list is named, a slight variation in form is given. "Reelaiah" is the name found in this passage. Doubtless, one is a corruption of the other. Both have the same root meaning.s generally been identified with Regina, mentioned by Ptolemy and Steph. Byzantr. as a city in Southeastern Arabia on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The Septuagint (Rhegma) itself supposes this site. But the Arabic name of the city here indicated is spelled with a "g" and so gives rise to a phonological difficulty. A more probable identification has been found in the Sabean ra`mah in Southwestern Arabia near Me`in in the north of Marib. Me`in was the capital of the old Minaean kingdom.
