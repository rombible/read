( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2%20Peter+1:1-13" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=2%20Peter+1:1-13&amp;t=niv">2&nbsp;Peter 1:1-13</a> ) Referring then to his approaching death, the apostle assigns as grounds of assurance for believers his own personal testimony as eye-witness of the transfiguration and the sure word of prophecy--that is the testimony of the Holy Ghost. vs. ( <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2%20Peter+1:14-21" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible/passage.aspx?q=2%20Peter+1:14-21&amp;t=niv">2&nbsp;Peter 1:14-21</a> ) The danger of being misled by false prophets is dwelt upon with great earnestness throughout the second chapter, which is almost identical in language and subject with the Epistle of Jude. The overthrow of all opponents of Christian truth is predicted in connection with prophecies touching the second advent of Christ, the destruction of the world by fire, and the promise of new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. ch. 3. This epistle of Peter presents questions of difficulty. Doubts as to its genuineness were entertained by the early Church; in the time of Eusebius it was reckoned among the disputed books, and was not formally admitted into the canon until the year 393, at the Council of Hippo. These difficulties, however, are insufficient to justify more than hesitation in admitting its ,genuineness. A majority of names may be quoted in support of the genuineness and authenticity of this epistle. (It is very uncertain as to the time when it was written. It was written near the close of Peters life--perhaps about A.D. 68--from Rome or somewhere on the journey thither from the East --<I>Alford</I> .) </FONT>[E] indicates this entry was also found in Easton's Bible Dictionary<br></body></html>
