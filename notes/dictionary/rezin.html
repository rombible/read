            <P><B>REZIN</B><P> re'-zin (retsin; Rhaasson):
<P> The last of the kings of Syria who reigned in Damascus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+15:37">2&nbsp;Kings 15:37</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+16:5-10">16:5-10</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:1">Isaiah 7:1</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+8:4-7">8:4-7</A>). Alona with Pekah, the son of Remaliah, who reigned 20 years over Israel in Samaria, he joined in the Syro-Ephraimitic war aaainst Ahaz, the king of Judah. Together they laid siege to Jerusalem, but were unsuccessful in the effort to take it (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+16:5">2&nbsp;Kings 16:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:1">Isaiah 7:1</A>). It was to calm the fears, and to restore the fainting spirits of the men of Judah, that Isaiah was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that the schemes of "these two tails of smoking firebrands" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+7:4">Isaiah 7:4</A>) were destined to miscarry. It was then, too, that the sign was aiven of the vigin who should conceive, and bear a son, and should call his name Immanuel. Rezin had to content himself on this campaign to the South with the capture of Elath from the men of Judah and its restoration to the men of Edom, from whom it had been taken and made a seaport by Solomon (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+16:6">2&nbsp;Kings 16:6</A>, where it is agareed that "Syria" and "Syrians" should be read "Edom" and "Edomites," which in the Hebrew script are easy to be mistaken for one another, and are in fact often mistaken). Rezin, however, had a more formidable enemy to encounter on his return to Damascus. Ahaz, like kings of Judah before and after him, placed his reliance more on the arm of flesh than on the true King of his people, and appealed to Tiglath-pileser III, of Assyria, for help. Ahaz deliberately sacrificed the independence of his country in the terms of his offer of submission to the Assyrian: "I am thy servant and thy son" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+16:7">2&nbsp;Kings 16:7</A>). Tiglath-pileser had already carried his arms to the West and ravaged the northern border of Israel; and now he crossed the Euphrates and hastened to Damascus, slaying Rezin and carrying his people captive to Kir (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+16:9">2&nbsp;Kings 16:9</A>). In the copious Annals of Tialath-pileser, Rezin figures with the designation Racunu(ni), but the tablet recording his death, found and read by Sir Henry Rawlinson, has been irrecoverably lost, and only the fact of its existence and loss remains (Schrader, COT, I, 252, 257). With the death of Rezin the kingdom of Damascus and Syria came to an end.
