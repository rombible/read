            <P><B>HAMON-GOG</B><P> ha'-mon-gog (hamon-gogh, "the multitude of Gog"):
<P> The name of the place where "Gog and all his multitude" are to be buried (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+39:11,15">Ezekiel 39:11,15</A>). By a change in the pointing of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+39:11">Ezekiel 39:11</A>, ha-`abharim for ha-`obherim, we should read "valley of Abarim" for "valley of them that pass through." In that case it would seem that the prophet thought of some ravine in the mountains East of the Dead Sea.
