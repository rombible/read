            <P><B>DEAL</B><P> del:
<P> The noun "deal" is not found in the Revised Version (British and American). The King James Version translation of `issaron, "the tenth deal" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+29:40" target="_blank">Exodus 29:40</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+14:10">Leviticus 14:10</A>, et al.) is rendered uniformly "the tenth part" in the Revised Version (British and American) (see <a href="weights-and-measures.html">WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</a>). The verb "to deal" often means "to apportion," "to distribute" (compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+6:19">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+16:3">1&nbsp;Chronicles 16:3</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+58:7">Isaiah 58:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+12:3">Romans 12:3</A>), but more frequently it is used in the sense of "to act" "to do," "to have transaction of any kind with." In the Psalms "to deal" always means "to confer benefit," "to deal bountifully," with the exception of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+105:25">Psalms 105:25</A>, where it means "to deal subtly with." The expression "to deal," i.e. "to be engaged in," is not found in the Scriptures. The translation of sugchraomai, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+4:9">John 4:9</A>, "Jews have no dealings with Samaritans," conveys the idea that they have nothing in common.
