            <P><B>HIGH THINGS</B><P> The translation of hupselos, "high," "lofty," "elevated" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</A>, "Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate," the King James Version margin "be contented with mean things," the Revised Version (British and American) "Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to (margin "Greek:
<P> be carried away with") things (margin "them") that are lowly"); high things are proud things, things regarded by the world as high.
<P> High thing is hupsoma, "a high place," "elevation," etc. (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+10:5">2&nbsp;Corinthians 10:5</A>, "casting down every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God," "like a lofty tower or fortress built up proudly by the enemy"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jdt+10:8">Judith 10:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jdt+13:4">13:4</A>, hupsoma is rendered "exaltation."
