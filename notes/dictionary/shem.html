            <P><B>SHEM</B><P> shem (shem; Sem):
<P> 1. Position in Noah's Family:
<P> His Name:
<P> The eldest son of Noah, from whom the Jews, as well as the Semitic ("Shemitic") nations in general have descended. When giving the names of Noah's three sons, Shem is always mentioned first (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+9:18">Genesis 9:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:1">10:1</A>, etc.); and though "the elder" in "Shem the brother of Japheth the elder" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+10:21">Genesis 10:21</A> margin) is explained as referring to Shem, this is not the rendering of Onkelos. His five sons peopled the greater part of West Asia's finest tracts, from Elam on the East to the Mediterranean on the West. Though generally regarded as meaning "dusky" (compare the Assyr-Babylonian samu--also Ham--possibly = "black," Japheth, "fair"), it is considered possible that Shem may be the usual Hebrew word for "name" (shem), given him because he was the firstborn--a parallel to the Assyr-Babylonian usage, in which "son," "name" (sumu) are synonyms (W. A. Inscriptions, V, plural 23, 11,29-32abc).
<P> 2. History, and the Nations Descended from Him:
<P> Shem, who is called "the father of all the children of Eber," was born when Noah had attained the age of 500 years (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+5:32">Genesis 5:32</A>). Though married at the time of the Flood, Shem was then childless. Aided by Japheth, he covered the nakedness of their father, which Ham, the youngest brother, had revealed to them; but unlike the last, Shem and Japheth, in their filial piety, approached their father walking backward, in order not to look upon him. Two years after the Flood, Shem being then 100 years old, his son Arpachshad was born (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+11:10">Genesis 11:10</A>), and was followed by further sons and daughters during the remaining 500 years which preceded Shem's death. Noah's prophetic blessing, on awakening from his wine, may be regarded as having been fulfilled in his descendants, who occupied Syria (Aramaic), Palestine (Canaan), Chaldea (Arpachshad), Assyria (Asshur), part of Persia (Elam), and Arabia (Joktan). In the first three of these, as well as in Elam, Canaanites had settled (if not in the other districts mentioned), but Shemites ruled, at some time or other, over the Canaanites, and Canaan thus became "his servant" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+9:25,26">Genesis 9:25,26</A>). The tablets found in Cappadocia seem to show that Shemites (Assyrians) had settled in that district also, but this was apparently an unimportant colony. Though designated sons of Shem, some of his descendants (e.g. the Elamites) did not speak a Semitic language, while other nationalities, not his descendants (e.g. the Canaanites), did.
