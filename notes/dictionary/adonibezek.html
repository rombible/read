            <P><B>ADONIBEZEK</B><P> a-do-ni-be'-zek ('adhonibhezeq "lord of Bezek"):
<P> Lord of a town, Bezek, in southern Palestine, whom the tribes of Judah and Simeon overthrew. Adonibezek fled when his men were defeated, but was captured, and was punished for his cruelty in cutting off the thumbs and great toes of seventy kings by a similar mutilation. Being brought to Jerusalem, he died there (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+1:5-7">Judges 1:5-7</A>). This not to be confused with Adonizedek, as in the Septuagint. This is quite another name.
