            <P><B>TIMON</B><P> ti'-mon (Timon):
<P> One of "the seven" chosen to relieve the apostles by attending to "the daily ministration" to the poor of the Christian community in Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</A>). The name is Greek, but as Nicolaus is distinguished from the remaining six as a proselyte, Timon and the others were probably Jews by birth.
