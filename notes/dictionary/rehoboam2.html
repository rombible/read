The people demanded a remission of the severe burdens imposed by Solomon, and Rehoboam, rejecting the advice of his fathers counsellors, followed that of his young courtiers, and returned an insulting answer, which led to an open rebellion among the tribes, and he was compelled to fly to Jerusalem, Judah and Benjamin alone remaining true to him. Jeroboam was made king of the northern tribes. [<B><a href="jeroboam.html" target="_blank" url="jeroboam.html">JEROBOAM</a></B>] An expedition to reconquer Israel was forbidden by the prophet Shemaiah, ( <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/12-21.html" target="_blank" url="https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/12-21.html">1&nbsp;Kings 12:21</a> ) still during Rehoboams lifetime peaceful relations between Israel and Judah were never restored.

Jerusalem itself was taken and Rehoboam had to purchase an ignominious peace by delivering up the treasures with which Solomon had adorned the temple and palace. The rest of Rehoboams life was unmarked by any events of importance. He died B.C. 958, after a reign of 17 years, having ascended the throne B.C. 975, at the age of 41.
