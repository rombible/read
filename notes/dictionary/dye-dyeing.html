            <P><B>DYE; DYEING</B><P> di, di'-ing (me'oddam, hamuc, tebhul, cebha`):
<P> Four different Hebrew words have been translated "dyed":
<P> the King James Version
<P> (a) me'-oddam, found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+25:5">Exodus 25:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+26:14">26:14</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+35:7">35:7</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+36:19">36:19</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+39:34">39:34</A>;
<P> (b) hamuts (the Revised Version, margin "crimsoned") (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+63:1">Isaiah 63:1</A>);
<P> (c) tebhul (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+23:15">Ezekiel 23:15</A>). Tebhul is probably more correctly rendered "flowing turban" as in the Revised Version (British and American) of the above verses (Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Lexicon);
<P> (d) gebha`, "dyed" is so translated in the American Standard Revised Version of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+5:30">Judges 5:30</A> (BDB); compare Arabic sabagh.
<P> The above references and other color words mentioned elsewhere (see <a href="color-colors.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">COLOR</a>) indicate that the Israelites were acquainted with dyed stuffs, even if they themselves did not do the dyeing. An analysis of the various Biblical references shows but four colors which were produced on cloth by dyeing, namely, purple, blue (violet), crimson and scarlet. Of these, purple is the one best known because of the many historical references to it. It was the symbol of royalty and luxury. Because of its high price, due to the expensive method of obtaining it, only royalty and the rich could afford purple attire. One writer tells us that the dyestuff was worth its weight in silver. Probably it was because of its scarcity, and because it was one of the very limited number of dyes known, rather than for any remarkable beauty of color, that the purple was so much sought after. If Pliny's estimate is to be accredited, then "in the dye the smell of it was offensive and the color itself was harsh, of a greenish hue and strongly resembling that of the sea when in a tempestuous state."
<P> 1. Purple and Blue:
<P> The purple and blue dyes were extracted from shellfish. The exact process used by the ancients is still a question in spite of the attempts of early writers to describe it. Tyre and Sidon were noted as the suppliers of these colors, hence, the name "Tyrian purple." The inhabitants of these cities were at first simply dealers in the purple (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eze+27:7,24">Ezekiel 27:7,24</A>), but they afterward became the manufacturers, as the heaps of the emptied shells of the Murex trunculus, which still exist in the vicinity of these cities, testify. The pigment was secreted by a gland in the lining of the stomach. The shell was punctured and the fish removed in order to secure the dye. The juice, at first whitish, changed on exposure to yellowish or greenish and finally to red, amethyst or purple, according to the treatment. A modified color was obtained by first dipping the textile in a cochineal bath and then in the purple, Tyrian purple was considered most valuable when it was "exactly the color of clotted blood and of a blackish hue" (Pliny). See also \LYDIA\; \ thYATIRA\.
<P> Besides the shellfish above mentioned, several other species are noted by different writers, namely, Murex branderis, Murex erinaceus, Murex buccinum (purpura haemastoma). This latter species is still used by the dwellers on the shores where it is found. Various species of the murex are found today at Haifa (Syria), about the Greek isles and on the North coast of Africa. The purple color has been produced from them by modern chemists, but it is of historical interest only, in the light of the discovery of modern artificial dyes with which it could not compete commercially.
<P> Two words have been used in the Hebrew Bible to describe the colors from shellfish:
<P> (a) 'argaman (Greek porphura). This has been translated "purple";
<P> (b) tekheleth which was probably a shade of violet, but has been translated "blue" in both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American).
<P> 2. Crimson and Scarlet:
<P> As indicated elsewhere (See <a href="color-colors.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">COLORS</a>), three Hebrew words have been rendered crimson or scarlet:
<P> (a) karmil (compare Arabic kirmiz and English "carmine"),
<P> (b) tola', and
<P> (c) shani. We know nothing further about the method of producing these colors than that they were both obtained from the kermes insect which feeds on a species of live oak growing in Southern Europe and Turkey in Asia. The modern dyer can obtain several shades from the cochineal insect by varying the mordants or assistants used with the dye. Pliny mentions the same fact as being known by the ancient Egyptians. Some of the Syrian dyers still use the kermes, commonly called dud ("worms"), although most of them hove resorted to the artificial European dyes which they indiscriminately call dud frangy ("foreign worms").
<P> The "rams' skins dyed red" mentioned in Exodus are still made in Syria. After the ram's skin has been tanned in sumac, it is laid out on a table and a solution of the dye, made by boiling dud in water, is rubbed on. After the dye is dry, the skin is rubbed with oil and finally polished. No native product is more characteristic of the country than the slippers, Bedouin shoes, and other leather articles made from "rams' skins dyed red" (see <a href="tanner.html" target="_blank">TANNER</a>).
<P> 3. Other Dyes Probably Known:
<P> Other dyes probably known were:
<P> (1) Madder.
<P> In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+10:1">Judges 10:1</A>, we read that "after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah." These were probably names of clans. In the Hebrew they are also color words. Tola` is the scarlet dye and pu'ah, if, as is probable, it is the same as the Arabic fuwah, means "madder." This would add another dyestuff. Until the discovery of alizarin, which is artificial madder, the growing of fuwah was one of the industries of Cyprus and Syria. It was exported to Europe and was also used locally for producing "Turkey red" on cotton and for dyeing dull reds on wool for rug making (see \ thYATIRA\). It was the custom near Damascus for a father to plant new madder field for each son that was born. The field began to yield in time to support the boy and later become his inheritance. Madder is mentioned in the Talmud and by early Latin writers. A Saracenic helmet and a shield of similar origin, in the possession of the writer, are lined with madder-dyed cotton.
<P> (2) Indigo. Another dye has been discovered among the Egyptian mummy cloths, namely, indigo. Indigo blue was used in weaving to form the borders of the cloths. This pigment was probably imported from India.
<P> (3) Yellows and Browns. Yellows and browns of doubtful origin have also been found in the Egyptian tombs. The Jews acquired from the Phoenicians the secret of dyeing, and later held the monopoly in this trade in some districts. A Jewish guild of purple dyers is mentioned on a tombstone in Hieropolis. In the 12th century AD Jews were still dyers and glass workers at Tyre. Akhissar, a Jewish stronghold in Asia Minor, was famous as a dyeing city. See also \ATTIRE\; \DYED ATTIRE\.
