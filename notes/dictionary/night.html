            <P><B>NIGHT</B><P> nit.
<P> See DAY AND NIGHT for the natural usage and the various terms.
<P> 1. In the Old Testament:
<P> Figurative uses:
<P> The word "night" (laylah or layil is sometimes used figuratively in the Old Testament. Thus, Moses compares the brevity of time, the lapse of a thousand years, to "a watch in the night" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+90:4">Psalms 90:4</A>). Adversity is depicted by it in such places as <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+35:10">Job 35:10</A>; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+8:20">Isaiah 8:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+15:9">Jeremiah 15:9</A>. Disappointment and despair are apparently depicted by it in the "burden of Dumah" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+21:11,12">Isaiah 21:11,12</A>); and spiritual blindness, coming upon the false prophets (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=mic+3:6">Micah 3:6</A>); again sudden and overwhelming confusion (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=am+5:8">Amos 5:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+59:10">Isaiah 59:10</A> the King James Version, nesheph, "twilight" as in the Revised Version (British and American)).
<P> 2. In the New Testament:
<P> On the lips of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+9:4">John 9:4</A>) it signifies the end of opportunity to labor; repeated in that touching little allegory spoken to His disciples when He was called to the grave of Lazarus (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+11:9,10">John 11:9,10</A>). Paul also uses the figure in reference to the Parousia (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</A>), where "night" seems to refer to the present aeon and "day" to the aeon to come. He also uses it in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1th+5:5,7">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:5,7</A> where the status of the redeemed is depicted by "day," that of the unregenerate by "night," again, as the context shows, in reference to the Parousia. In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=re+21:25">Revelation 21:25</A> and 22:5, the passing of the "night" indicates the realization of that to which the Parousia looked forward, the establishment of the kingdom of God forever.
