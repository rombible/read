            <P><B>REFUTE</B><P> re-fut':
<P> Only in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:22">Jude 1:22</A>, the American Revised Version margin "And some refute while they dispute with you," where the Revised Version (British and American) in the text reads "And on some have mercy, who are in doubt."
<P> The Greek text of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:22,23">Jude 1:22,23</A> is very uncertain, being given very differently in the various manuscripts. the Revised Version (British and American) text follows the two oldest manuscripts, Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. Instead of eleate, "have mercy," the reading elegchete, "refute," "convict," has the powerful support of Codex Alexandrinus, Codex Ephraemi, the best cursives, Vulgate, Memphitic, Armenian and Ethiopian versions, and is placed in the text by Lachmann, Tischendorf, and Tregelles (Westcott-Hort in list of "Suspected Readings" says:
<P> "Some primitive error probable: perhaps the first eleate an interpolation"). Compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jude+1:15">Jude 1:15</A>, where the same Greek word occurs in the same sense (the King James Version "convince," the Revised Version (British and American) "convict"); compare also <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ti+5:20">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:20</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</A>, where the same idea of refuting the sinful occurs.
