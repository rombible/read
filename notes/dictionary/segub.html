            <P><B>SEGUB</B><P> se'-gub (seghubh (Qere), seghibh (Kethibh); Codex Vaticanus Zegoub; Codex Alexandrinus Segoub):
<P> 15:27; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+9:22">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:22</A>, etc.), And chozeh (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+24:11">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+17:13">2&nbsp;Kings 17:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+21:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 21:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25:5">25:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+29:29">29:29</A>, etc.). The former designation is from the ordinary verb "to see"; the latter is connected with the verb used of prophetic vision. It appears from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+9:9">1&nbsp;Samuel 9:9</A> that "seer" (ro'-eh) was the older name for those who, after the rise of the more regular orders, were called "prophets." It is not just, however, to speak of the "seers" or "prophets" of Samuel's time as on the level of mere fortune-tellers. What insight or vision they possessed is traced to God's Spirit. Samuel was the ro'-eh by pr-eeminence, and the name is little used after his time. Individuals who bear the title "seer" (chozeh) are mentioned in connection with the kings and as historiographers (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2sa+24:11">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:11</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+21:9">1&nbsp;Chronicles 21:9</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+25:5">25:5</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+29:29">29:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+9:29">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:29</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+12:15">12:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ch+19:2">19:2</A>, etc.), and distinction is sometimes made between "prophets" and "seers" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ki+17:13">2&nbsp;Kings 17:13</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+29:29">1&nbsp;Chronicles 29:29</A>, etc.). Havernick thinks that "seer" denotes one who does not belong to the regular prophetic order (Introductions to Old Testament, 50, English translation), but it is not easy to fix a precise distinction.
<P> (1) The youngest son of Hiel, the rebuilder of Jericho (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ki+16:34">1&nbsp;Kings 16:34</A>). The death of Segub is probably connected with the primitive custom of laying foundations with blood, as, indeed, skulls were found built in with the brickwork when the tower of Bel at Nippur was excavated. See GEZER. If the death of the two sons was based on the custom just mentioned, the circumstance was deliberately obscured in the present account. The death of Segub may have been due to an accident in the setting up of the gates. In any event, tradition finally yoked the death of Hiel's oldest and youngest sons with a curse said to have been pronounced by Joshua on the man that should venture to rebuild Jericho (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jos+6:26">Joshua 6:26</A>).
<P> (2) Son of Hezron and father of Jair (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1ch+2:21">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:21</A>).
