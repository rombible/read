<P> Found in the King James Version for ger, (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ex+18:3">Exodus 18:3</A>) = "guest," hence: "foreigner," "sojourner" the Revised Version (British and American); also for nekhar (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+61:5">Isaiah 61:5</A>) = "foreign," "a foreigner" the Revised Version (British and American) (concrete), "heathendom" (abstract), "alien," "strange" (-er), and for nokhri (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=de+14:21">Deuteronomy 14:21</A> the Revised Version (British and American) "foreigner"; compare <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=job+19:15">Job 19:15</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+69:8">Psalms 69:8</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=la+5:2">Lamentations 5:2</A>)--"strange," in a variety of degrees and meanings: "foreign," "non-relative," "adulterous," "different," "wonderful," "alien," "outlandish," "strange." In the New Testament we find apellotriomenos (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=col+1:21">Colossians 1:21</A>) = "being alienated," and allotrios (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=heb+11:34">Hebrews 11:34</A>) = "another's," "not one's own," hence: "foreign," "not akin," "hostile." In the Old Testament the expression was taken in its literal sense, referring to those who were not Israelites--the heathen; in the New Testament it is given a figurative meaning, as indicating those who have not become naturalized in the kingdom of God, hence are outside of Christ and the blessing of the gospel.
