            <P><B>DELUSION</B><P> de-lu'-zhun:
<P> (1) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+66:4">Isaiah 66:4</A>, "I also will choose their delusions" (the Revised Version, margin "mockings"), Hebrew ta`alulim, which occurs only here and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+3:4">Isaiah 3:4</A> (where it is translated "babes," the Revised Version, margin "childishness"). Its meaning is somewhat ambiguous. The best translation seems to be "wantonness," "caprice." "Their wanton dealing, i .e. that inflicted on them" (BDB). Other translations suggested are "insults" (Skinner), "freaks of fortune" (Cheyne), "follies" (Whitehouse). Septuagint has empaigmata, "mockings," Vulgate (Jerome's Latin Bible, 390-405 A. D.) illusiones.
<P> (2) <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2th+2:11">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:11</A> the King James Version, "God shall send them strong delusion" (the Revised Version (British and American) "God sendeth them a working of error"), plane, "a wandering," "a roaming about," in the New Testament "error" either of opinion or of conduct.
