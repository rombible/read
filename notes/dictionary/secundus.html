            <P><B>SECUNDUS</B><P> se-kun'-dus (Westcott-Hort Greek text Se'koundos, Textus Receptus of the New Testament, Sekou'ndos):
<P> A Thessalonian who was among those who accompanied Paul from Greece to Asia (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</A>). They had preceded Paul and waited for him at Troas. If he were one of the representatives of the churches in Macedonia and Greece, entrusted with their contributions to Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</A>; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2co+8:23">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:23</A>), he probably accompanied Paul as far as Jerusalem. The name is found in a list of politarchs on a Thessalonian inscription.
