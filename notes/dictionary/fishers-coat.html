            <P><B>FISHER'S COAT</B><P> kot:
<P> This expression is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=joh+21:7">John 21:7</A> where the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version have "coat." John here, after representing Peter as "naked" (gumnos), pictures him as girding on his "coat" (ependutes), literally, "upper garment," and not at all specifically a "fisher's coat."
<P> See DRESS.
