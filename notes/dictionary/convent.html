<P> Found in the King James Version margin of <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+49:19">Jeremiah 49:19</A>: "Who will convent me in judgment?" and in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jer+50:44">Jeremiah 50:44</A>: "Who will convent me to plead?" The Hebrew term which is rendered convent is ya`adh, and it means to summon to a court, to call on to plead. Convent is obsolete, but it was formerly used, and meant to summon, or to call before a judge. Shakespeare used it several times. In King Henry VIII, Act V, he said, "The lords of the council hath commanded that the archbishop be convented to the council board."
