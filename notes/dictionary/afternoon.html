            <P><B>AFTERNOON</B><P> af-ter-noon' (neToth ha-yom, "the declining of the day"; <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=jud+19:8">Judges 19:8</A> the King James Version):
<P> The expression kechom ha-yom, "in the heat of the day" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+18:1">Genesis 18:1</A>) refers to the early afternoon when the sun is a little past its zenith, its rays still being very strong. The phrase le-ruach ha-yom, "in the cool of the day" (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ge+3:8">Genesis 3:8</A>) is in contrast to the last phrase and points to the late afternoon; in the Orient a cooling breeze arises at this period of the day, and it is then that much of the day's business is transacted.
