            <P><B>BOSOR</B><P> bo'-sor (Bosor):
<P> (1) A city named among those taken by Judas Maccabeus "in the land of Gilead" (1 Macc 5:26,36). From the towns named it is evident that this phrase is elastic, covering territory beyond what is usually called the land of Gilead. Possibly therefore Bosor may be identical with Bucr el-Chariri, in the Luchf, Southeast of el-Leja'.
<P> (2) In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2pe+2:15">2&nbsp;Peter 2:15</A> the King James Version, the Greek form of \BEOR\ (which see).
