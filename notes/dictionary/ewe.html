            <P><B>EWE</B><P> u (rachel, `ul, seh, "a female sheep"):
<P> Rachel (compare pr. note Rachel, and Arabic rachala, "to migrate") is the ordinary Hebrew word for ewe, but is translated "sheep," though with clear indication of sex in context, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+53:7">Isaiah 53:7</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=so+6:6">Song of Solomon 6:6</A> (the Revised Version (British and American) "ewes"). `Aloth, participle of `ul, "to suckle" (compare Arabic ghal) is found in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ps+78:71">Psalms 78:71</A> and <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=isa+40:11">Isaiah 40:11</A> (the King James Version "are with young," the English Revised Version "that give suck," the American Standard Revised Version "have their young"). In <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=1sa+6:7,10">1&nbsp;Samuel 6:7,10</A> occurs paroth `aloth, "milch kine." Seh, in <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=le+22:28">Leviticus 22:28</A>, while translated "ewe," might from the context be "ewe" or "shegoat" and indeed seems to be used here as a term applying equally to either, being used elsewhere for one of a flock of sheep or goats.
