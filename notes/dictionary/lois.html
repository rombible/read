            <P><B>LOIS</B><P> lo'-is (Lois (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:5">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:5</A>)):
<P> The grandmother of Timothy, and evidently the mother of Eunice, Timothy's mother. The family lived at Lystra (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</A>). It was on the occasion of Paul's first missionary journey (<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=ac+14">Acts 14</A>) that Eunice and Timothy were converted to Christ, and it was, in all likelihood, on the same occasion that Lois also became a Christian. Paul speaks of the unfeigned faith that there was in Timothy, and he adds that this faith dwelt at the first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice. This is the only passage where Lois is mentioned; but by comparing <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+1:5">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:5</A> with <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?q=2ti+3:15">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:15</A> (the King James Version), where Paul refers to Timothy's having "from a child known the holy scriptures," it would appear that Lois was associated with Eunice, both in a reverent faith in God and in the careful instruction in the Old Testament which was given to Timothy.
<P> See EUNICE; TIMOTHY.
