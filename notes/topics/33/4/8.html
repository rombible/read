All the peoples will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.'--MICAH iv. 5 (R.V.). This is a statement of a general truth which holds good of all sorts of religion. 'To walk' is equivalent to carrying on a course of practical activity. 'The name' of a god is his manifested character. So the expression 'Walk in the name' means, to live and act according to, and with reference to, and in reliance on, the character of the worshipper's  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/as_god_so_worshipper.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/champness/broken_bread/xii_and_we_will.htm">"And we Will --"</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The prophet Micah was struck with the energy and devotion of the heathen to their gods.  He saw the grip these idols had of their votaries, how no expense was spared, no sacrifice withheld, for the sake of a filthy lie embodied in a stone or golden image.  While he listened to the songs of the heathen, his heart warmed as he thought of the greatness of Jehovah, and so he cried out--"All people will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/champness/broken_bread/xii_and_we_will.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Champness&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Broken Bread</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/pink/the_redeemers_return/6_the_battle_of_armageddon.htm">The Battle of Armageddon. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The Battle of Armageddon!
