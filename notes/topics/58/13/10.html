Hebrews xiii. 8.  "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and for  ever." Let me first briefly remind you, as the truth upon which my whole  explanation of this text is built, that man is not meant either for  solitude or independence.  He is meant to live WITH his fellow-men, to  live BY them, and to live FOR them.  He is healthy and godly, only when  he knows all men for his brothers; and himself, in some way or other, as  the servant of all, and bound in ties of love and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/all_saints_day_and_other_sermons/sermon_xxxi_the_unchangeable_christ.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">All Saints' Day and Other Sermons</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/february_26_make_you_perfect.htm">February 26.

LET me read to you the verse that comes before our text. It is a good habit always to look at texts in their connection. It is wrong, I think, to lay hold of small portions of God's Word, and take them out of their connection as you might pluck feathers from a bird; it is an injury to the Word; and, sometimes, a passage of Scripture loses much of its beauty, its true teaching, and its real meaning, by being taken from the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_40_1894/the_unchangeable_christ.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 40: 1894</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_5_1859/the_blood_of_the_everlasting.htm">The Blood of the Everlasting Covenant</a><br></span><span class="snippet">I.
