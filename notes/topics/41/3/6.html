There is something about the name of this miserable man which commands our attention at once.  There is a sort of fascination about his wickedness, and when we read his story it is difficult to give it up until we have come to its awful end.  It is rather significant, it would seem to me, that his name should come last in the list of the Apostles, and the text, "And Judas Iscariot," would suggest to me not only that his name was last, but  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/chapman/and_judas_iscariot/and_judas_iscariot.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">J.
