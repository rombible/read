And Nathan said unto David, The Lord also hath put away thy sin.'--2 SAMUEL xii. 13.  We ought to be very thankful that Scripture never conceals the faults of its noblest men. High among the highest of them stands the poet- king. Whoever, for nearly three thousand years, has wished to express the emotions of trust in God, longing after purity, aspiration, and rapture of devotion, has found that his words have been before him.

And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man.'--2 SAMUEL xii. 5-7.  Nathan's apologue, so tenderly beautiful, takes the poet-king on the most susceptible side of his character. All his history shows him as a man of wonderfully sweet, chivalrous, generous, swiftly compassionate nature.
