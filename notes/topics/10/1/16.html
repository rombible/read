It is the record of the soul experiences of the race. Its language is that of the heart, and its thoughts of common interest to worshipful humanity. It reflects almost every phase of religious feeling: penitence, doubt, remorse, confession, fear, faith, hope, adoration, and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/xii_the_history_of_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Foster Kent&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Origin & Permanent Value of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/gordon/quiet_talks_on_the_crowned_christ_of_revelation/i_the_christ_crowned_the_fact.htm">The Christ Crowned, the Fact</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"When God sought a King for His people of old, He went to the fields to find him; A shepherd was he, with his crook and his lute And a following flock behind him.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jasher.htm">Jasher</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ashkelon.htm">Ashkelon</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gath.htm">Gath</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gilboa.htm">Gilboa</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/mount_gilboa.htm">Mount Gilboa</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/anointed.htm">Anointed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/blood.htm">Blood</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/holy.htm">Holy</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/killed.htm">Killed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lord's.htm">Lord's</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/marked.htm">Marked</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mouth.htm">Mouth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/oil.htm">Oil</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saying.htm">Saying</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/slain.htm">Slain</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/testified.htm">Testified</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/witness.htm">Witness</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">The Amalekite who accused himself of Saul's death is slain</a></span><br><span class="reftext">17. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-17.htm">David laments Saul and Jonathan with a song</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-16.htm">2 Samuel 1:16</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5157.htm"><b>5157</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5572.htm"><b>5572</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sword</a></body></html>
