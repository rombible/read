Beth-cerem, Nehemiah 3:14. "The stones, as well of the altar, as of the ascent to the altar, were from the valley of Beth-cerem, which they digged out beneath the barren land. And thence they are wont to bring whole stones, upon which the working iron came not." The fathers of the traditions, treating concerning the blood of women's terms, reckon up five colours of it; among which that, "which is like the water of the earth, out of the valley of Beth-cerem."--Where the Gloss writes thus, "Beth-cerem  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_55_divers_matters.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/v_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"So David fled, and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done unto him.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings.
