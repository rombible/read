The supposition that it dates from that period throws great force into many parts of it, and gives a unity to what is else apparently fragmentary and disconnected.

The Scripture teaches positively that the hardening and "darkening of their foolish heart" is a divine, intentional act.

It will not be necessary to extend our preliminary remarks on the prophet Amos, since on the main point--viz., the circumstances under which he appeared as a prophet--the introduction to the prophecies of Hosea may be regarded as having been written for those of Amos also. For, according to the inscription, they belong to the same period at which Hosea's prophetic ministry began, viz., the latter part of the reign of Jeroboam II., and after Uzziah had ascended the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophet_amos.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm">Samuel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Alike from the literary and the historical point of view, the book[1] of Samuel stands midway between the book of Judges and the book of Kings.

The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/araunah.htm">Araunah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/dan.htm">Dan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gad.htm">Gad</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gadites.htm">Gadites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hittites.htm">Hittites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hivite.htm">Hivite</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hivites.htm">Hivites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zidon.htm">Zidon</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/aroer_2.htm">Aroer</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/beersheba.htm">Beersheba</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/dan.htm">Dan</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gilead.htm">Gilead</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jazer.htm">Jazer</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/kadesh.htm">Kadesh</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/negeb.htm">Negeb</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/sidon.htm">Sidon</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/tyre.htm">Tyre</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aroer.htm">Aroer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aro'er.htm">Aro'er</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/brook.htm">Brook</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/camped.htm">Camped</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/crossed.htm">Crossed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/direction.htm">Direction</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/encamp.htm">Encamp</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/encamped.htm">Encamped</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gad.htm">Gad</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gadites.htm">Gadites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gorge.htm">Gorge</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jaazer.htm">Jaazer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jazer.htm">Jazer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jordan.htm">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lieth.htm">Lieth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/middle.htm">Middle</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/midst.htm">Midst</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pass.htm">Pass</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/passed.htm">Passed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pitched.htm">Pitched</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/ravine.htm">Ravine</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/river.htm">River</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/south.htm">South</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/starting.htm">Starting</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/towards.htm">Towards</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/town.htm">Town</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/valley.htm">Valley</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-1.htm">David, tempted by Satan, forces Joab to number the people</a></span><br><span class="reftext">5. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm">The captains, in nine months and twenty days, gather 1,300,000 fighting men</a></span><br><span class="reftext">10. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-10.htm">David repents, and having three plagues proposed by God, chooses pestilence</a></span><br><span class="reftext">15. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm">After the death of 70,000, David by prayer prevents the destruction of Jerusalem</a></span><br><span class="reftext">18. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm">David, by God's direction, purchases Araunah's threshing floor;
