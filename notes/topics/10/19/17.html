Chapel Royal, St James's, December 17th, 1871. 2 Sam. xix. 14.  "He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the  heart of one man." No circumstances can be more different, thank God, than those under which  the heart of the men of Judah was bowed when their king commander  appealed to them, and those which have, in the last few days, bowed the  heart of this nation as the heart of one man.

GEORGE MILLIGAN, M.A., D.D.  "There is nothing," says Socrates to Cephalus in the Republic, "I like better than conversing with aged men.  For I regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom it is right to learn the character of the way, whether it is rugged or difficult, or smooth and easy" (p. 328 E.).

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a
