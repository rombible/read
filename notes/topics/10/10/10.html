When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians: 10. And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/more_than_conquerors_through_him.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/barzillai.htm">Barzillai</a><br></span><span class="snippet">BY REV. GEORGE MILLIGAN, M.A., D.D.  "There is nothing," says Socrates to Cephalus in the Republic, "I like better than conversing with aged men.  For I regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom it is right to learn the character of the way, whether it is rugged or difficult, or smooth and easy" (p. 328 E.). It is to such an aged traveller that we are introduced in the person of Barzillai the Gileadite.

T hat which often passes amongst men for resolution, and the proof of a noble, courageous spirit, is, in reality, the effect of a weak and little mind. At least, it is chiefly owing to the presence of certain circumstances, which have a greater influence upon the conduct, than any inherent principle.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abishai.htm">Abishai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hadadezer.htm">Hadadezer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hadarezer.htm">Hadarezer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hanun.htm">Hanun</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/maacah.htm">Maacah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/nahash.htm">Nahash</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rehob.htm">Rehob</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shobach.htm">Shobach</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/syrians.htm">Syrians</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/beth-rehob.htm">Beth-rehob</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/euphrates_river.htm">Euphrates River</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/helam.htm">Helam</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jericho.htm">Jericho</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/maacah.htm">Maacah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/rehob.htm">Rehob</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/tob.htm">Tob</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/zobah.htm">Zobah</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abishai.htm">Abishai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abi'shai.htm">Abi'shai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ammon.htm">Ammon</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/array.htm">Array</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/arrayed.htm">Arrayed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bene-ammon.htm">Bene-ammon</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/brother.htm">Brother</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/charge.htm">Charge</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/command.htm">Command</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/committed.htm">Committed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/delivered.htm">Delivered</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/deployed.htm">Deployed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/meet.htm">Meet</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/placed.htm">Placed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/position.htm">Position</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/remainder.htm">Remainder</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rest.htm">Rest</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/setteth.htm">Setteth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sons.htm">Sons</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">David's messengers, sent to comfort Hanun are villainously treated</a></span><br><span class="reftext">6. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">The Ammonites, strengthened by the Syrians, overcome by Joab and Abishai</a></span><br><span class="reftext">15. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-15.htm">Shobuch, making a new supply of the Syrains at Helam, is slain by David</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-19</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5087.htm"><b>5087</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, <i>reign of</i></a></body></html>
