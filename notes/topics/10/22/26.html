The Ptolemaic system of astronomy, which had then full possession of the minds of men, contemplated the whole visible universe from the earth as the immovable centre of things. Copernicus changed the point of view, and placing the beholder in the sun, at once reduced the earth to an inconspicuous globule, a merely subordinate  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/temple/essays_and_reviews_the_education_of_the_world/mosaic_cosmogony.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Frederick Temple&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Essays and Reviews: The Education of the World</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_ten_commandments/2_1_the_first_commandment.htm">The First Commandment</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Thou shalt have no other gods before me.' Exod 20: 3. Why is the commandment in the second person singular, Thou? Why does not God say, You shall have no other gods? Because the commandment concerns every one, and God would have each one take it as spoken to him by name. Though we are forward to take privileges to ourselves, yet we are apt to shift off duties from ourselves to others; therefore the commandment is in the second person, Thou and Thou, that every one may know that it is spoken to him,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_ten_commandments/2_1_the_first_commandment.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Watson&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ten Commandments</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/burgon/inspiration_and_interpretation/v_in_the_present_crusade.htm">In the Present Crusade against the Bible and the Faith of Christian Men...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">IN the present crusade against the Bible and the Faith of Christian men, the task of destroying confidence in the first chapter of Genesis has been undertaken by Mr. C.
