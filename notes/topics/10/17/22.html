In the days when the son of Jesse had but few friends, it was a precious thing to be treated in the style Barzillai and his neighbours entertained him (see 2 Sam. xvii. 27-29).  They were rich farmers, and had land which brought forth with abundance, so were able to act with princely hospitality to the fugitive monarch.
