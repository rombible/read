These three hinges of the narrative are all abundantly illustrated in the psalms. As to the first, we have relics of the joyful ceremonial connected with it in two psalms, the fifteenth and twenty-fourth, which are singularly alike not  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/xi_the_kingcontinued.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of David</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/ix_the_king.htm">The King. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">We have now to turn and see the sudden change of fortune which lifted the exile to a throne.

Of the Author. The first that ordained fasting was God himself in paradise; and it was the first law that God made, in commanding Adam to abstain from eating the forbidden fruit. God would not pronounce nor write his law without fasting (Lev. xxiii), and in his law commands all his people to fast.
