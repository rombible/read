We stand here at the darkest hour of King David's life. Bowed down by the consciousness of his past sin, and recognising in the rebellion of his favourite son the divine chastisement, his early courage and buoyant daring seem to have ebbed from him wholly. He is forsaken by the mass of his subjects, he is preparing to abandon Jerusalem, and to flee as an  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/a_loyal_vow.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/ittai_of_gath.htm">Ittai of Gath</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.'--2 SAMUEL xv. 21.  It was the darkest hour in David's life. No more pathetic page is found in the Old Testament than that which tells the story of his flight before Absalom. He is crushed by the consciousness that his punishment is deserved--the bitter fruit of the sin that filled all his later life  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/ittai_of_gath.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/pardoned_sin_punished.htm">Pardoned Sin Punished</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'And It came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 2.

And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. 3. And Absalom said unto him.

He has cast in his lot with him for better and for worse, and he means to be faithful to the end.
