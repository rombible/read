David's good-for-nothing son Absalom had brought about the murder of one of his brothers, and had fled the country. His father weakly loved the brilliant blackguard, and would fain have had him back, but was restrained by a sense of kingly duty. Joab, the astute Commander-in- chief, a devoted friend of David, saw how the land lay, and formed a plan to give the king an excuse for doing what he wished to do.

He, knowing that we will not come by any other means, sendeth a serious trial: he sets our barley-field on fire; which he has a right to do, seeing our barley-fields are far  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_10_1864/the_barley_field_on_fire.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 10: 1864</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_beatitudes_an_exposition_of_matthew_51-12/17_the_blessed_privilege_of.htm">The Blessed Privilege of Seeing God Explained</a><br></span><span class="snippet">They shall see God.

From their lips and pens have come practically all the writings of the Old Testament. Of these three classes the wise men or sages are far less prominent or well known.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zeruiah.htm">Zeruiah</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/geshur.htm">Geshur</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/tekoa.htm">Tekoa</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ab'salom.htm">Ab'salom</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/clear.htm">Clear</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heart.htm">Heart</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/inclined.htm">Inclined</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jo'ab.htm">Jo'ab</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/king's.htm">King's</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/knoweth.htm">Knoweth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/longed.htm">Longed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/perceived.htm">Perceived</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/towards.htm">Towards</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/turning.htm">Turning</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zeruiah.htm">Zeruiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zeru'iah.htm">Zeru'iah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zeruial.htm">Zeruial</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-1.htm">Joab, suborning a widow of Tekoah to incline the king's heart to fetch Absalom,</a></span><br><span class="reftext">21. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-21.htm">brings him home to Jerusalem</a></span><br><span class="reftext">25. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm">Absalom's beauty, hair, and children</a></span><br><span class="reftext">28. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-28.htm">After two years, Absalom is brought into the king's presence by Joab</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5014.htm"><b>5014</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart, <i>human</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5781.htm"><b>5781</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affection</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1-3</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5920.htm"><b>5920</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pretence</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5948.htm"><b>5948</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shrewdness</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1-20</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5383.htm"><b>5383</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lawsuits</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1-24</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/6682.htm"><b>6682</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mediation</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1-33</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/6684.htm"><b>6684</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mediator</a></body></html>
