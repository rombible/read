And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee, Live.

When we were in the East we noticed the beautiful process of raising rice. The rice is sown on a morass of mud and water, ploughed up by great buffaloes, and after a few weeks it springs up and appears above the water with its beautiful pale green shoots. The seed has been sown very thickly and the plants are clustered together in great numbers, so that you can pull up a score at a single handful. But now comes the process of transplanting.

Inward silence is absolutely indispensable, because the Word is essential and eternal, and necessarily requires dispositions in the soul in some degree correspondent to His nature, as a capacity for the reception of Himself. Hearing is a sense formed to receive sounds, and is rather passive than active, admitting, but not communicating sensation; and if we would hear, we must lend the ear  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/guyon/a_short_and_easy_method_of_prayer/chapter_xiv_of_inward_silence.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Madame Guyon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Short and Easy Method of Prayer</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bouvieres/a_short_method_of_prayer_and_spiritual_torrents/chapter_xi_of_rest_in.htm">Of Rest in the Presence of God --Its Fruits --Inward Silence --God Commands it --Outward Silence. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The soul, being brought to this place, needs no other preparation than that of repose: for the presence of God during the day, which is the great result of prayer, or rather prayer itself, begins to be intuitive and almost continual. The soul is conscious of a deep inward happiness, and feels that God is in it more truly than it is in itself. It has only one thing to do in order to find God, which is to retire within itself.
