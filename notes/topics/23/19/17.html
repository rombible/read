Of the manner in which the great Supreme as God acts, as well as of Himself, our knowledge is limited. Yet though even of the effects on creatures of His doings we know little, we have reason to rejoice that, in His word He has informed us, and in His providence illustrated by that word, he has given us to  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_ii_manner_of_covenanting.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Cunningham&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ordinance of Covenanting</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_xiii_covenanting_predicted_in.htm">Covenanting Predicted in Prophecy. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The fact of Covenanting, under the Old Testament dispensations, being approved of God, gives a proof that it was proper then, which is accompanied by the voice of prophecy, affording evidence that even in periods then future it should no less be proper.
