God has promised that He will dwell with him that is humble and of a contrite heart. Jesus has shed the oil of His benediction on the poor in spirit. It is the men who form the exact antithesis to these characters who are addressed here.

It is useless to ask for that to be hallowed which is always holy. But the name of God is always holy, according to Lk. 1:49, "Holy is His name." Again, His kingdom is everlasting, according to Ps. 144:13, "Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages." Again, God's will is always fulfilled, according to Isa 46:10, "All My will shall be done."

Inward silence is absolutely indispensable, because the Word is essential and eternal, and necessarily requires dispositions in the soul in some degree correspondent to His nature, as a capacity for the reception of Himself. Hearing is a sense formed to receive sounds, and is rather passive than active, admitting, but not communicating sensation; and if we would hear, we must lend the ear  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/guyon/a_short_and_easy_method_of_prayer/chapter_xiv_of_inward_silence.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Madame Guyon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Short and Easy Method of Prayer</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bouvieres/a_short_method_of_prayer_and_spiritual_torrents/chapter_xi_of_rest_in.htm">Of Rest in the Presence of God --Its Fruits --Inward Silence --God Commands it --Outward Silence. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The soul, being brought to this place, needs no other preparation than that of repose: for the presence of God during the day, which is the great result of prayer, or rather prayer itself, begins to be intuitive and almost continual. The soul is conscious of a deep inward happiness, and feels that God is in it more truly than it is in itself. It has only one thing to do in order to find God, which is to retire within itself. As soon as the eyes are closed, it finds itself in prayer.
