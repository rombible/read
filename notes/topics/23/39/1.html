Sennacherib either failed to inherit his father's good fortune, or lacked his ability.* He was not deficient in military genius, nor in the energy necessary to withstand the various enemies who rose against him at widely removed points of his frontier, but he had neither the adaptability of character nor the delicate tact required to manage successfully the heterogeneous elements combined under his sway. * The two principal  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maspero/history_of_egypt_chaldaea_syria_babylonia_and_assyria_v_8/chapter_isennacherib_705-681_b_c.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">G.

Whence a certain wise man providently dissuades, saying, My son, meddle not with many matters (Ecclus. xi. 10); because, that is, the mind is by no means collected on the plan of any single work while parted among divers.

Micah signifies: "Who is like Jehovah;" and by this name, the prophet is consecrated to the incomparable God, just as Hosea was to the helping God, and Nahum to the comforting God. He prophesied, according to the inscription, under Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. We are not, however, entitled, on this account, to dissever his prophecies, and to assign particular discourses to the reign of each of these kings.

His words and thoughts are those of a man whose eyes had seen the King, vi. 5. The times in which he lived were big with political problems, which he met as a statesman who saw the large meaning of events, and as a prophet who read a divine purpose in history. Unlike his younger contemporary Micah, he was, in all probability, an aristocrat; and during his long ministry (740-701 B.C., possibly, but not probably later) he bore testimony, as  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/isaiah.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/baladan.htm">Baladan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/merodachbaladan.htm">Merodachbaladan</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/babylon.htm">Babylon</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/baladan.htm">Baladan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bal'adan.htm">Bal'adan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/envoys.htm">Envoys</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gift.htm">Gift</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heareth.htm">Heareth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hezeki'ah.htm">Hezeki'ah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/ill.htm">Ill</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/illness.htm">Illness</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/letter.htm">Letter</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/letters.htm">Letters</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/merodach.htm">Merodach</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/merodachbaladan.htm">Merodachbaladan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/merodach-baladan.htm">Merodach-baladan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mer'odach-bal'adan.htm">Mer'odach-bal'adan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/news.htm">News</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/offering.htm">Offering</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/present.htm">Present</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/recovered.htm">Recovered</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/recovery.htm">Recovery</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sick.htm">Sick</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/strong.htm">Strong</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Merodach-baladan, sending to visit Hezekiah, has notice of his treasures.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">3. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah, understanding thereof, foretells the Babylonian captivity.</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5325.htm"><b>5325</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gifts</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5391.htm"><b>5391</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;letters</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1-2</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5307.htm"><b>5307</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;envoy</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5976.htm"><b>5976</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visiting</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1-7</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5305.htm"><b>5305</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empires</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1-8</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4215.htm"><b>4215</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babylon</a></body></html>
