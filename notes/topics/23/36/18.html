A strict adherence to this arrangement, however, it is found, would exclude from our pages some of the most talented discourses of our early Divines; and it is therefore deemed expedient to depart from it as occasion may require. The following Sermon will occupy two numbers, and we hope, that from its intrinsic value, its historical interest, and the illustrious name of its author, it  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/knox/the_pulpit_of_the_reformation_nos_1_2_and_3_/a_sermon_on_isaiah_xxvi.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Knox&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Pulpit Of The Reformation, Nos. 1, 2 and 3. </span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcgarvey/the_four-fold_gospel/xl_jesus_heals_multitudes_beside.htm">Jesus Heals Multitudes Beside the Sea of Galilee. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">^A Matt.
