ISAIAH xii. 3.  There are two events separated from each other by more than fifteen hundred years which have a bearing upon this prophecy: the one supplied the occasion for its utterance, the other claimed to be its interpretation and its fulfilment. The first of these is that scene familiar to us all, where the Israelites in the wilderness murmured for want of water, and the law-giver, being at his wits' end what to do with his  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_h/the_well-spring_of_salvation.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_k/my_strength_and_song.htm"> 'My Strength and Song'</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'The Lord is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation....'
