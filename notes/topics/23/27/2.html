Lyrical emotion makes the prophet's language obscure by reason of its swift transitions from one mood of feeling to another. But the main drift here is discernible. God is guarding Israel, His vineyard, and before Him its foes are weak as 'thorns and briers,' whose end is to be burned. With daring anthropomorphism, the prophet puts into God's mouth a longing for the enemies to measure  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_h/the_grasp_that_brings_peace.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/murray/the_ministry_of_intercession/twelfth_day_for_the_spirit.htm">Twelfth Day for the Spirit to Convince the World of Sin</a><br></span><span class="snippet">WHAT TO PRAY.--For the Spirit to convince the World of Sin "I will send the Comforter to you.

The first work of the Spirit on the world is conviction of sin. Without that, no deep or abiding revival, no powerful conversion.

Viewed in its innermost substance, the history of the Old Testament is not different from its typical institutions, nor yet these two from its predictions.
