Isaiah xxiii. 7. It is difficult to describe the agony of terror which fell on the wretched inhabitants of the gayest city of the East when they awoke to a sense of the folly into which they had been driven. These soft Syrians had no real leaders and no settled purpose of rebellion. They had simply yielded to a childish impulse of vexation. They had rebelled against an increase of taxation which might be burdensome, but was by no means  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/farrar/gathering_clouds_a_tale_of_the_days_of_st_chrysostom/chapter_iii_the_agony_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Frederic William Farrar&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Gathering Clouds: A Tale of the Days of St. Chrysostom</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kempis/imitation_of_christ/a_prayer_for_the_spirit.htm">A Prayer for the Spirit of Devotion</a><br></span><span class="snippet">6.

All Christians receive the Old and New Testament as sacred writings, but they are not agreed about the meaning which they attribute to them. The book itself remains as at the first; the commentators seem rather to reflect the changing atmosphere of the world or of the Church. Different individuals or bodies of Christians have a different point of view, to which their interpretation  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/temple/essays_and_reviews_the_education_of_the_world/on_the_interpretation_of_scripture.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Frederick Temple&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Essays and Reviews: The Education of the World</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/burgon/inspiration_and_interpretation/vii_the_essay_which_brings.htm">The Essay which Brings up the Rear in this Very Guilty Volume is from The...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The Essay which brings up the rear in this very guilty volume is from the pen of the "Rev.
