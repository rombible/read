"He Shall Dwell on High" (Isa. xxxiii. 16). </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"He shall dwell on high" (Isa. xxxiii. 16). It is easier for a consecrated Christian to live an out and out life for God than to live a mixed life. A soul redeemed and sanctified by Christ is too large for the shoals and sands of a selfish, worldly, sinful life. The great steamship, St. Paul, could sail in deep water without an effort, but she could make no progress in the shallow pool, or on the Long Branch sands; the smallest tugboat is worth a dozen of her there; but out in mid-ocean she could  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/april_2_he_shall_dwell.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.

This glowing promise becomes even more striking if we mark its connection with the solemn question in the previous context. 'Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?' is the prophet's question; 'who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?' That question really means, Who is capable 'of communion with God'?

One great peculiarity of Jerusalem, which distinguishes it from almost all other historical cities, is that it has no river.
