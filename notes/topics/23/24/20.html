"The Lord hath spoken this word," and it is a word of judgment. It unveils some of the terrible issues of sin. See the effects of sin upon the spirit of man. "The merry-hearted do sigh." Life loses its wings and its song. The buoyancy and the optimism die out of the soul. The days move with heavy feet, and duty becomes very stale and unwelcome.

The life of Badman is a very interesting description, a true and lively portraiture, of the demoralized classes of the trading community in the reign of King Charles II; a subject which naturally led the author to use expressions familiar among such persons, but which are now either obsolete or considered as vulgar.

His words and thoughts are those of a man whose eyes had seen the King, vi. 5. The times in which he lived were big with political problems, which he met as a statesman who saw the large meaning of events, and as a prophet who read a divine purpose in history. Unlike his younger contemporary Micah, he was, in all probability, an aristocrat; and during his long ministry (740-701 B.C., possibly, but not probably later) he bore testimony, as  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/isaiah.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/mount_zion.htm">Mount Zion</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/tyre.htm">Tyre</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/addeth.htm">Addeth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/cottage.htm">Cottage</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/crushing.htm">Crushing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/disobedience.htm">Disobedience</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/drink.htm">Drink</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/drunkard.htm">Drunkard</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/drunken.htm">Drunken</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/fall.htm">Fall</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/fallen.htm">Fallen</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/falleth.htm">Falleth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/falls.htm">Falls</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/forth.htm">Forth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/fro.htm">Fro</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/greatly.htm">Greatly</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/guilt.htm">Guilt</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hammock.htm">Hammock</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heavy.htm">Heavy</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hut.htm">Hut</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lies.htm">Lies</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lodge.htm">Lodge</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/moved.htm">Moved</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/moving.htm">Moving</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/overcome.htm">Overcome</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/reel.htm">Reel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/reeleth.htm">Reeleth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/reels.htm">Reels</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/removed.htm">Removed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rise.htm">Rise</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shack.htm">Shack</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shaken.htm">Shaken</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shaking.htm">Shaking</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stagger.htm">Stagger</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/staggers.htm">Staggers</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sway.htm">Sway</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/swayeth.htm">Swayeth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sways.htm">Sways</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/tent.htm">Tent</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thereof.htm">Thereof</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/totters.htm">Totters</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/transgression.htm">Transgression</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/uncertainly.htm">Uncertainly</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/weight.htm">Weight</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wind.htm">Wind</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">The doleful judgments of God upon the land</a></span><br><span class="reftext">13. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-13.htm">A remnant shall joyfully praise him</a></span><br><span class="reftext">16. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">God in his judgments shall advance his kingdom</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-20.htm">Isaiah 24:20</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/6173.htm"><b>6173</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guilt, <i>and God</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17-21</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4045.htm"><b>4045</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chaos</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19-20</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4820.htm"><b>4820</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earthquake</a></body></html>
