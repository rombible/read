The prophet here shows us how there is a great staircase which we ourselves build, which leads straight from earth to heaven, and how we can secure that we shall meet with God and God with us. 'Isaiah' is often called the evangelical prophet. He is so, not only because of his predictions of the suffering Servant of Jehovah which are 'fulfilled' in Christ, but because his conceptions  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_h/how_to_meet_god.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xix_seek_first_the.htm">"Seek First the Kingdom of God," &C. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Matt. vi. 33.--"Seek first the kingdom of God," &c.

The things of this world, even great events, are but poor, petty, and inconsiderable matters, when compared with these.
