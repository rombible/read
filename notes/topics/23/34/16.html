Differently to be admonished are the simple and the insincere.  The simple are to be praised for studying never to say what is false, but to be admonished to know how sometimes to be silent about what is true.  For, as falsehood has always harmed him that speaks it, so sometimes the hearing of truth has done harm to some.  Wherefore the Lord before His disciples, tempering His speech with silence, says, I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now (Joh. xvi. 12).  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_xi_how_the_simple.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Leo the Great&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Writings of Leo the Great</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/yonge/the_chosen_people/questions.htm">Questions. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">LESSON I. 1.

His words and thoughts are those of a man whose eyes had seen the King, vi. 5. The times in which he lived were big with political problems, which he met as a statesman who saw the large meaning of events, and as a prophet who read a divine purpose in history.
