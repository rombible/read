Nor do we feel sure, that they preceded what is about to be related. In the absence of exact data, the succession of events and their location must be matter of combination. From their position in the Evangelic narratives, and the manner in which all concerned speak and act, we inferred, that they took place at that particular  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/chapter_xxxv_the_two_sabbath-controversies.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/murray/holy_in_christ/eleventh_day_the_holy_one.htm">Eleventh Day.
