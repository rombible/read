It was not the first time it had fallen; we read of it in Leviticus ix. 24 as coming from before the Lord, and consuming the sacrifice.  It was God's way of showing His power and his favour, and it was something that could neither be imitated nor produced by anyone else besides Jehovah. I.--THIS FIRE CAME AT A TIME OF APOSTACY.
