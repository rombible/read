For he knows that either he must now or never prevail; for if their souls once go to heaven, he shall never vex nor trouble them any more. And therefore he will now bestir himself as much as he can, and labour to set before their eyes all the gross sins which ever they committed, and the judgments  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/meditations_against_despair_or_doubting.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Lewis Bayly&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Practice of Piety</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/chapter_v_the_cleansing_of.htm">The Cleansing of the Temple - the Sign,' which is not a Sign. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">It has been said that Mary understood, and yet did not understand Jesus.
