If his offering be a burnt-sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord. 4.

The cup of Herod's misdeeds, but also of his misery, was full. During the whole latter part of his life, the dread of a rival to the throne had haunted him, and he had sacrificed thousands, among them those nearest and dearest to him, to lay that ghost.

Hence, there was little need of writing them down. But when most of the priests were carried captive to Babylonia, as in 597 B.C., and ten years later the temple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/ix_influences_that_gave_rise.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Foster Kent&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Origin & Permanent Value of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/leviticus.htm">Leviticus</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The emphasis which modern criticism has very properly laid on the prophetic books and the prophetic element generally in the Old Testament, has had the effect of somewhat diverting popular attention from the priestly contributions to the literature and religion of Israel.
