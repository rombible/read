While the temple stood, the ceremonial rites and customs received constant illustration, and were transmitted directly from father to son in the priestly families. Hence, there was little need of writing them down. But when most of the priests were carried captive to Babylonia, as in 597 B.C., and ten years later the temple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/ix_influences_that_gave_rise.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Foster Kent&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Origin & Permanent Value of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/finney/systematic_theology/lecture_xxxvi_justification.htm">Justification. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Christ is represented in the gospel as sustaining to men three classes of relations. 1.

We now proceed to show how it should be translated, and give our reason for it.
