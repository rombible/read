A: In his being born, and that in a low condition, made under the law, undergoing the miseries of this life, the wrath of God, and the cursed death of the cross. Christ's humiliation consisted in his incarnation, his taking flesh, and being born. It was real flesh that Christ took; not the image of a body (as the Manichees erroneously held), but a true body; therefore he  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_body_of_divinity/6_christs_humiliation_in_his.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Watson&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Body of Divinity</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/rhees/the_life_of_jesus_of_nazareth/v_the_early_years_of.htm">The Early Years of Jesus</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Matt. i. 1 to ii. 23; Luke i. 5 to ii. 52; iii. 23-38  58.
