It is quite in accordance with the abrupt departure of Jesus from Capernaum, and its motives, that when, so far from finding rest and privacy at Bethsaida (east of the Jordan), a greater multitude than ever had there gathered around Him, which would fain have proclaimed Him King, He resolved on immediate return to the western shore, with the view of seeking a quieter retreat, even though it were  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/chapter_xxxi_the_cavils_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcgarvey/the_four-fold_gospel/lviii_jairus_daughter_and_the.htm">Jairus' Daughter and the Invalid Woman. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">(Capernaum, Same Day as Last.) ^A Matt.
