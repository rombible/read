Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 10. And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/youthful_confessors.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/appendix_v_rabbinic_theology_and.htm">Appendix v.

Because, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6), there can be no mean and extremes in things which are essentially good. Now intellective knowledge is essentially good: because man's perfection would seem to consist in his intellect being reduced from potentiality to act, and this is done by the knowledge of truth. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the good of the human soul is to be in accordance with reason,"  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_curiosity_can_be_about.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/wesley/sermons_on_several_occasions/sermon_27_upon_our_lords.htm">Upon Our Lord's SermonOn the Mount</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Discourse 7 "Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance.
