Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 10. And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/youthful_confessors.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/appendix_v_rabbinic_theology_and.htm">Appendix v.

Because, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6), there can be no mean and extremes in things which are essentially good. Now intellective knowledge is essentially good: because man's perfection would seem to consist in his intellect being reduced from potentiality to act, and this is done by the knowledge of truth. For Dionysius says (Div.
