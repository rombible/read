This is the promise for the Lord's coming. It is more than purity. It is to be made white, lustrous, or bright. To be purified is to have the sin burned out; to be made white is to have the glory of the Lord burned in. The one is cleansing, the other is illumination and glorification. The Lord has both for us, but in order for us to have both, we must be put into the fire to be tried, and to be led into difficult and peculiar places  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/april_5_many_shall_be.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
