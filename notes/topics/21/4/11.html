Jesus lived at one of those times when the game of public life is freely played, and when the stake of human activity is increased a hundredfold.

And for your fearlessness against them hold this sure sign--whenever there is any apparition, be not prostrate with fear, but whatsoever it be, first boldly ask, Who art thou? And from whence comest thou? And if it should be a vision of holy ones they will assure you, and change your fear into joy. But if the vision should be from the devil, immediately it becomes feeble, beholding your firm purpose of mind. For merely to ask, Who art thou [1083] ? and whence comest thou? is a proof of coolness.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/athanasius/select_works_and_letters_or_athanasius/life_of_antony_section_43.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Athanasius&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Select Works and Letters or Athanasius</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_7_the_upbringing_of.htm">The Upbringing of Jewish Children</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The tenderness of the bond which united Jewish parents to their children appears even in the multiplicity and pictorialness of the expressions by which the various stages of child-life are designated in the Hebrew. Besides such general words as "ben" and "bath"--"son" and "daughter"--we find no fewer than nine different terms, each depicting a fresh stage of life. The first of these simply designates the babe as the newly--"born"--the "jeled," or, in the feminine, "jaldah"--as in Exodus 2:3, 6, 8.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_7_the_upbringing_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sketches of Jewish Social Life</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bernard/some_letters_of_saint_bernard_abbot_of_clairvaux/letter_xxxvi_circa_a_d_1131.htm">Letter xxxvi (Circa A.
