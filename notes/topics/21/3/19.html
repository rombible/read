There is considerable difficulty in understanding what precise meaning is to be attached to these words, and what precise bearing they have on the general course of the writer's thoughts; but one or two things are, at any rate, quite clear. The Preacher has been enumerating all the various vicissitudes of prosperity and adversity, of construction and destruction, of society and solitude,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/eternity_in_the_heart.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/a_time_to_plant.htm"> 'A Time to Plant'</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'A time to plant.'--Eccles. iii. 2.  The writer enumerates in this context a number of opposite courses of conduct arranged in pairs, each of which is right at the right time.
