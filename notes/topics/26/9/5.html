"The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great;" and "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." We can learn nothing of the gospel, except by feeling its truths--no one truth of the gospel is ever truly known and really learned, until we have tested and tried and proved it, and its power has been exercised upon us. I have heard of a naturalist, who thought himself exceedingly wise with regard to the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_4_1858/the_evil_and_its_remedy.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 4: 1858</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/first_for_thy_thoughts.htm">First, for Thy Thoughts. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1. Be careful to suppress every sin in the first motion; dash Babylon's children, whilst they are young, against the stones; tread, betimes, the cockatrice's egg, lest it break out into a serpent; let sin be to thy heart a stranger, not a home-dweller: take heed of falling oft into the same sin, lest the custom of sinning take away the conscience of sin, and then shalt thou wax so impudently wicked, that thou wilt neither fear God nor reverence man. 2.

By John Bunyan ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR. The life of Badman is a very interesting description, a true and lively portraiture, of the demoralized classes of the trading community in the reign of King Charles II; a subject which naturally led the author to use expressions familiar among such persons, but which are now either obsolete or considered as vulgar. In fact it is the only work proceeding from the prolific  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/the_life_and_death_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Bunyan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of John Bunyan Volumes 1-3</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_7_the_upbringing_of.htm">The Upbringing of Jewish Children</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The tenderness of the bond which united Jewish parents to their children appears even in the multiplicity and pictorialness of the expressions by which the various stages of child-life are designated in the Hebrew. Besides such general words as "ben" and "bath"--"son" and "daughter"--we find no fewer than nine different terms, each depicting a fresh stage of life. The first of these simply designates the babe as the newly--"born"--the "jeled," or, in the feminine, "jaldah"--as in Exodus 2:3, 6, 8.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_7_the_upbringing_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sketches of Jewish Social Life</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">To a modern taste, Ezekiel does not appeal anything like so powerfully as Isaiah or Jeremiah.

Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/axes.htm">Axes</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/compassion.htm">Compassion</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ears.htm">Ears</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/eye.htm">Eye</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/follow.htm">Follow</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hearing.htm">Hearing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kill.htm">Kill</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mercy.htm">Mercy</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pass.htm">Pass</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pity.htm">Pity</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/showing.htm">Showing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/smite.htm">Smite</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spare.htm">Spare</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/strike.htm">Strike</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/town.htm">Town</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/using.htm">Using</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-1.htm">A vision, whereby is shown the preservation of some</a></span><br><span class="reftext">5. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-5.htm">and the destruction of the rest</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-8.htm">God cannot be entreated for them</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1-8</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5612.htm"><b>5612</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3-6</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5899.htm"><b>5899</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lament</a></body></html>
