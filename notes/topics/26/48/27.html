They may serve for examination as well as consolation, and at the beginning of a year they may fulfill this useful double purpose. In any case they are full of marrow and fatness to those whose spiritual taste is purified. It is esteemed by the prophet to be the highest blessing that could come upon a city that its name should be, "JEHOVAH-SHAMMAH, The Lord is there." Even Jerusalem, in its best estate, would have this for its crowning blessing:  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_37_1891/jehovah-shammah_a_glorious_name_for.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 37: 1891</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/taylor/separation_and_service/part_iii_princely_service.htm">Princely Service. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">NUMB. VII.  We learned from Numbers vi, GOD'S requirements of those who desire to take the privileged position of separation to Himself. We found also in the conclusion of the same chapter the overflow of GOD'S love in the rich and comprehensive blessing which so appropriately follows, and forms the connecting link between Nazarite separation and the princely service set forth in Chap. vii,--one of the longest in the Bible, and one full of repetition.
