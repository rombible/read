Let us now examine the conditions under which a revelation may be expected to be given to the original recipients. It may be observed in the first place that a revelation must possess some distinctive character.

Viewed in its innermost substance, the history of the Old Testament is not different from its typical institutions, nor yet these two from its predictions.
