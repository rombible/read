Read the context--"Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the Lord: unto us is this land given in possession." This unbrotherly language moved the Lord to send the prophet Ezekiel with good and profitable words to the children of the captivity.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_34_1888/a_little_sanctuary.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 34: 1888</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_10_1864/a_mystery_saints_sorrowing_and.htm">A Mystery!

How surprising! He does not say, "I regret that I have tarried so long." He does not say, "I ought to have hastened, but even now it is not too late." Hear, and marvel! Wonder of wonders, He says, "I am glad that I was not there." Glad! the word is out of place? Lazarus, by this time, stinketh in his tomb,and here is the Saviour glad!

We have come to the most difficult part in the discussion of the work of the Holy Spirit, viz., the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the tenth day after the ascension. In the treatment of this subject it is not our aim to create a new interest in the celebration of Pentecost. We consider this almost impossible. Man's nature is too unspiritual for this.

Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/azur.htm">Azur</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/azzur.htm">Azzur</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/benaiah.htm">Benaiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jaazaniah.htm">Jaazaniah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pelatiah.htm">Pelatiah</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/chaldea.htm">Chaldea</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/chebar.htm">Chebar</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/azur.htm">Azur</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/azzur.htm">Azzur</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/behold.htm">Behold</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/benaiah.htm">Benaiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/benai'ah.htm">Benai'ah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bringeth.htm">Bringeth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/door.htm">Door</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/doorway.htm">Doorway</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/east.htm">East</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/east-gate.htm">East-gate</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/eastward.htm">Eastward</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/entrance.htm">Entrance</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/faced.htm">Faced</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/faces.htm">Faces</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/facing.htm">Facing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gate.htm">Gate</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gateway.htm">Gateway</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heads.htm">Heads</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jaazaniah.htm">Jaazaniah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/ja-azani'ah.htm">Ja-azani'ah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/leaders.htm">Leaders</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lift.htm">Lift</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lifted.htm">Lifted</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lifting.htm">Lifting</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/looks.htm">Looks</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lord's.htm">Lord's</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/midst.htm">Midst</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/moreover.htm">Moreover</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/opening.htm">Opening</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pelatiah.htm">Pelatiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pelati'ah.htm">Pelati'ah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/princes.htm">Princes</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rulers.htm">Rulers</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spirit.htm">Spirit</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/twenty.htm">Twenty</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/twenty-five.htm">Twenty-five</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wind.htm">Wind</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm">The presumption of the princes</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-4.htm">Their sin and judgment</a></span><br><span class="reftext">13. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel complaining, God shows him his purpose in saving a remnant</a></span><br><span class="reftext">22. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm">The glory of God leaves the city</a></span><br><span class="reftext">24. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel is returned to the captivity</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1305.htm"><b>1305</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, <i>activity of</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1-12</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4478.htm"><b>4478</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat</a></body></html>
