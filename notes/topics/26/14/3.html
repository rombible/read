He learned to read and to write,[1] doubtless, according to the Eastern method, which consisted in putting in the hands of the child a book, which he repeated in cadence with his little comrades, until he knew it by heart.[2] It is doubtful, however, if he understood the Hebrew writings in their original tongue.

For this reason also disobedience is a greater sin than murder, unchastity, theft and dishonesty, and all that these may include.  For we can in no better way learn how to distinguish between greater and lesser sins than by noting the order of the Commandments of God, although there are distinctions also within the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/a_treatise_on_good_works/thou_shalt_honor_thy_father.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Dr. Martin Luther&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Treatise on Good Works</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xvi_all_our_righteousnesses.htm">"All Our Righteousnesses are as Filthy Rags, and we all do Fade as a Leaf, and Our Iniquities, Like the Wind, have Taken us Away.

Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/block.htm">Block</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/blocks.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/cause.htm">Cause</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/caused.htm">Caused</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/consulted.htm">Consulted</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/directions.htm">Directions</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ear.htm">Ear</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/enquired.htm">Enquired</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/face.htm">Face</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/faces.htm">Faces</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/fall.htm">Fall</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gods.htm">Gods</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heart.htm">Heart</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hearts.htm">Hearts</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/inquire.htm">Inquire</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/inquired.htm">Inquired</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mind.htm">Mind</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/myself.htm">Myself</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/over-against.htm">Over-against</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stumbling.htm">Stumbling</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stumblingblock.htm">Stumblingblock</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stumbling-block.htm">Stumbling-block</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wicked.htm">Wicked</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-1.htm">God answers idolaters according to their own heart</a></span><br><span class="reftext">6. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm">They are exhorted to repent, for fear of judgments, by means of seduced prophets</a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-12.htm">God's irrevocable sentence of famine</a></span><br><span class="reftext">15. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">of wild beasts</a></span><br><span class="reftext">17. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-17.htm">of the sword</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-19.htm">and of pestilence</a></span><br><span class="reftext">22. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm">A remnant shall be reserved for example of others</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1-11</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8648.htm"><b>8648</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enquiring of God</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3-4</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5186.htm"><b>5186</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stumbling</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/6206.htm"><b>6206</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offence</a></body></html>
