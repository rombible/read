Can you speed back to that period when God dwelt alone, when this round world and all the things that be upon it, had not come from his hand; when the sun flamed not in his strength, and the stars flashed not in their brightness? Can you go back to the period when there were no angels, when cherubim and seraphim had not been born; and, if there be creatures elder than they, when none  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_62_1916/divine_destruction_and_protection.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 62: 1916</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_h/as_sodom.htm"> 'As Sodom'</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 4.

You have it thus,--"He came to his own, but his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them which believe on his name; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God."
