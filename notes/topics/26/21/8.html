When the Lord is punishing such a people against whom he hath a controversy, and a notable controversy, every one that is found shall be thrust through: and every one joined with them shall fall, Isa. xiii. 15. They partake in their judgment, not only because in a common calamity all shares, (as in Ezek. xxi. 3.) but chiefly because joined with and partakers with these whom God is pursuing; even as the strangers that join  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/section_v_scriptures_showing_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Hugh Binning&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of the Rev.

Luther calls mourning a rare herb'. Men have tears to shed for other things, but have none to spare for their sins. There are many murmurers, but few mourners. Most are like the stony ground which lacked moisture' (Luke 8:6). We have many cry out of hard times, but they are not sensible of hard hearts. Hot and dry is the worst temper of the body.

He studied at Geneva and was appointed to the Walloon Church in London in 1701. The scene of his great life work was, however, the Hague, where he settled in 1705. He has been compared with Bossuet, tho he never attained the graceful style and subtilty which characterize the "Eagle of Meaux." The story is told of the famous scholar Le Clerc that he long refused to hear Saurin preach, on the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kleiser/the_worlds_great_sermons_volume_3/saurin__paul_before_felix.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Grenville Kleiser&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The world's great sermons, Volume 3</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">To a modern taste, Ezekiel does not appeal anything like so powerfully as Isaiah or Jeremiah.

His imaginations border sometimes on the grotesque and sometimes on the mechanical. Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/babylon.htm">Babylon</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/negeb.htm">Negeb</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/rabbah.htm">Rabbah</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saying.htm">Saying</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel prophesies against Jerusalem with a sign of sighing</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-8.htm">The sharp and bright sword</a></span><br><span class="reftext">18. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-18.htm">against Jerusalem</a></span><br><span class="reftext">25. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-25.htm">against the kingdom</a></span><br><span class="reftext">28. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-28.htm">and against the Ammonites</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-8.htm">Ezekiel 21:8-12</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4514.htm"><b>4514</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stick</a></body></html>
