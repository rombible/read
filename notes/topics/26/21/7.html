Luther calls mourning a rare herb'. Men have tears to shed for other things, but have none to spare for their sins. There are many murmurers, but few mourners. Most are like the stony ground which lacked moisture' (Luke 8:6). We have many cry out of hard times, but they are not sensible of hard hearts. Hot and dry is the worst temper of the body.

He studied at Geneva and was appointed to the Walloon Church in London in 1701. The scene of his great life work was, however, the Hague, where he settled in 1705. He has been compared with Bossuet, tho he never attained the graceful style and subtilty which characterize the "Eagle of Meaux." The story is told of the famous scholar Le Clerc that he long refused to hear Saurin preach, on the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kleiser/the_worlds_great_sermons_volume_3/saurin__paul_before_felix.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Grenville Kleiser&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The world's great sermons, Volume 3</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">To a modern taste, Ezekiel does not appeal anything like so powerfully as Isaiah or Jeremiah.

His imaginations border sometimes on the grotesque and sometimes on the mechanical. Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a
