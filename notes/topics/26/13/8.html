For, as incautious speaking leads into error, so indiscreet silence leaves in error those who might have been instructed.  For often improvident rulers, fearing to lose human favour, shrink timidly from speaking freely the things that are right; and, according to the voice of the Truth (Joh. x. 12), serve unto the custody of the flock by no means  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_iv_that_the_ruler.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Leo the Great&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Writings of Leo the Great</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xii_now_the_end.htm">"Now the End of the Commandment," &C. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1 Tim. i. 5.--"Now the end of the commandment," &c.

Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/false.htm">FALSE</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/behold.htm">Behold</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/declares.htm">Declares</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/delusions.htm">Delusions</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/falsehood.htm">Falsehood</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lie.htm">Lie</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lies.htm">Lies</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lying.htm">Lying</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/says.htm">Says</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sovereign.htm">Sovereign</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/speak.htm">Speak</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spoken.htm">Spoken</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/substance.htm">Substance</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thus.htm">Thus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/uttered.htm">Uttered</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vanity.htm">Vanity</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/visions.htm">Visions</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">The reproof of false prophets</a></span><br><span class="reftext">10. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">and their untempered mortar</a></span><br><span class="reftext">17. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Of prophecies and their pillows</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-9</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/9250.htm"><b>9250</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woe</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-12</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1466.htm"><b>1466</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vision</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-23</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/7760.htm"><b>7760</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preachers, <i>responsibilities</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6-9</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1469.htm"><b>1469</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visions</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4125.htm"><b>4125</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan, <i>agents of</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6-10</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4123.htm"><b>4123</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan, <i>deceiver</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-7.htm">Ezekiel 13:7-9</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5943.htm"><b>5943</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-deception</a></body></html>
