For, as incautious speaking leads into error, so indiscreet silence leaves in error those who might have been instructed.  For often improvident rulers, fearing to lose human favour, shrink timidly from speaking freely the things that are right; and, according to the voice of the Truth (Joh. x. 12), serve unto the custody of the flock by no means  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_iv_that_the_ruler.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Leo the Great&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Writings of Leo the Great</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xii_now_the_end.htm">"Now the End of the Commandment," &C. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1 Tim. i. 5.--"Now the end of the commandment," &c.

Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a
