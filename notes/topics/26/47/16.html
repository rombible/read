EZEKIEL xlvii. 1. Unlike most great cities, Jerusalem was not situated on a great river. True, the inconsiderable waters of Siloam--'which flow softly' because they were so inconsiderable--rose from a crevice in the Temple rock, and beneath that rock stretched the valley of the Kedron, dry and bleached in the summer, and a rainy torrent during the rainy seasons; but that was all. So, many of the prophets, who looked forward to the better  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/the_river_of_life.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xiv_and_the_redeemer.htm">"And the Redeemer Shall Come unto Zion, and unto them that Turn,"</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Isaiah lix. 20.--"And the Redeemer shall come unto Zion, and unto them that turn," &c.

There is another very important bit needed to complete the circle of truth we are going over together in these quiet talks. Namely, the daily life after the act of surrender and all that comes with that act. The steady pull day by day. After the eagle-flight up into highest air, and the hundred yards dash, or even the mile run, comes the steady, steady walking mile after mile. The real test of life is here.

The position which has been assigned to Joel in the collection of the Minor Prophets, furnishes an external argument for the determination of the time at which Joel wrote. There cannot be any doubt that the Collectors were guided by a consideration of the chronology. The circumstance, that they placed the prophecies of Joel just between the two prophets who, according to the inscriptions and contents of their prophecies, belonged to the time of Jeroboam and Uzziah, is  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophet_joel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">To a modern taste, Ezekiel does not appeal anything like so powerfully as Isaiah or Jeremiah.
