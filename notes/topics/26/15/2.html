His imaginations border sometimes on the grotesque and sometimes on the mechanical. Yet he is a historical figure of the first importance; it was very largely from him that Judaism received the ecclesiastical impulse by which for centuries it was powerfully  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezekiel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/better.htm">Better</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/branch.htm">Branch</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/branching.htm">Branching</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/forest.htm">Forest</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/grew.htm">Grew</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/surpass.htm">Surpass</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/tree.htm">Tree</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/trees.htm">Trees</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vine.htm">Vine</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vine-branch.htm">Vine-branch</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vine-tree.htm">Vine-tree</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wood.htm">Wood</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/woods.htm">Woods</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">By the unfitness of the vine branch for any work</a></span><br><span class="reftext">6. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-6.htm">is shown the rejection of Jerusalem</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1-6</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4534.htm"><b>4534</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vine</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1-8</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1431.htm"><b>1431</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophecy, <i>OT methods</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4552.htm"><b>4552</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wood</a></body></html>
