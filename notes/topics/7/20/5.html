The grace and might of God be with you, Most Serene Majesty! most gracious, well beloved gentlemen! It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, a single poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help, and have now forced me too, to cry out and to ask, if God would give His Spirit to any one,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/first_principles_of_the_reformation/to_his_most_serene_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Martin Luther&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">First Principles of the Reformation</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/wesley/sermons_on_several_occasions/sermon_27_upon_our_lords.htm">Upon Our Lord's SermonOn the Mount</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Discourse 7 "Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance.
