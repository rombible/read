For the degrees of a thing bear relation to something that is on its own account, not on account of something else. Now, in prophecy, intellectual vision is sought on its own account, and imaginary vision on account of something else, as stated above (A[2], ad 2). Therefore it would seem that the degrees of prophecy are distinguished not according to imaginary, but only according to  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_degrees_of_prophecy.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcafee/study_of_the_king_james_bible/lecture_iii_the_king_james.htm">The King James Version as English Literature</a><br></span><span class="snippet">LET it be plainly said at the very first that when we speak of the literary phases of the Bible we are not discussing the book in its historic meaning. It was never meant as literature in our usual sense of the word. Nothing could have been further from the thought of the men who wrote it, whoever they were and whenever they wrote, than that they were making a world literature. They had the characteristics of men who do make great literature-- they had clear vision and a great passion for truth;  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcafee/study_of_the_king_james_bible/lecture_iii_the_king_james.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">McAfee&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Study of the King James Bible</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/barrows/companion_to_the_bible/chapter_xx_the_historical_books.htm">The Historical Books. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1. In the Pentateuch we have the establishment of the Theocracy, with the preparatory and accompanying history pertaining to it. The province of the historical books is to unfold its practiced working, and to show how, under the divine superintendence and guidance, it accomplished the end for which it was given. They contain, therefore, primarily, a history of God's dealings with the covenant people under the economy which he had imposed upon them.
