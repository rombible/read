In the Pentateuch we have the establishment of the Theocracy, with the preparatory and accompanying history pertaining to it. The province of the historical books is to unfold its practiced working, and to show how, under the divine superintendence and guidance, it accomplished the end for which it was given. They contain, therefore, primarily, a history of God's dealings with the covenant people under the economy which he had imposed upon them.

May we not justly conclude, from these words, that Jerusalem and Beth-el were opposite, as it were, in a right line?

"Sixteen miles on all sides from Tsippor was a land flowing with milk and honey."
