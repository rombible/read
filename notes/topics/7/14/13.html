Dr. Nathaniel Lardner (born in 1684, died in 1768), although a Socinian, or Unitarian, in his views on Christ's person, did excellent service to the cause of revealed religion against the Deism of his day by his truly learned and valuable work on the "Credibility  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/schaff/the_person_of_christ/introductory_remarks.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Philip Schaff&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Person of Christ</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_temptation_of_god.htm">Whether the Temptation of God Consists in Certain Deeds, Wherein the Expected Result is Ascribed to the Power of God Alone?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that the temptation of God does not consist in certain deeds wherein the result is expected from the power of God alone. Just as God is tempted by man so is man tempted by God, man, and demons. But when man is tempted the result is not always expected from his power. Therefore neither is God tempted when the result is expected from His power alone. Objection 2: Further, all those who work miracles by invoking the divine name look for an effect due to God's power alone.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_temptation_of_god.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/vi_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile --Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">We have one psalm which the title connects with the beginning of David's stay at Adullam,--the thirty-fourth.

From their lips and pens have come practically all the writings of the Old Testament. Of these three classes the wise men or sages are far less prominent or well known.
