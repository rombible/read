Few things in this world are so inspiring to the traveler and at the same time so depressing as a city or temple in ruins.  I remember a delightful experience in passing through the ruins of Karnak and Luxor, on the Nile in Egypt, and later passing through Phylae at Assuan on the Nile; and these two thoughts, each the opposite of the other, kept constantly coming to my mind.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/chapman/and_judas_iscariot/a_great_victory.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">J.
