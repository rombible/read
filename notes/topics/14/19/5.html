And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord. 3. Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God. 4.

It first appeared in a collection of his works in folio, 1692; and although a subject of universal interest; most admirably elucidated; no edition has been published in a separate form. Antichrist has agitated the Christian world from the earliest ages; and his craft has been to mislead the thoughtless, by  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/of_antichrist_and_his_ruin_.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Bunyan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of John Bunyan Volumes 1-3</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_xxii_how_those_that.htm">How those that are at Variance and those that are at Peace are to be Admonished. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">(Admonition 23.)  Differently to be admonished are those that are at variance and those that are at peace.  For those that are at variance are to be admonished to know most certainly that, in whatever virtues they may abound, they can by no means become spiritual if they neglect becoming united to their neighbours by concord.  For it is written, But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace (Gal. v. 22).  He then that has no care to keep peace refuses to bear the fruit of the Spirit.

This was preceded by smaller documents, which one or more redactors embodied in it. The earliest things committed to writing were probably the ten words proceeding from Moses himself, afterwards enlarged into the ten commandments which exist at present in two recensions (Exod. xx., Deut. v.)

Though written by the same hand as wrote Ezra-Nehemiah, and forming, together with these books, a continuous history of Judah, it is placed after them in the Hebrew Bible, of which it forms the concluding book; and this no doubt points to the fact that it attained canonical distinction later than they. Nor is this unnatural.
