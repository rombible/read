And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth" (1 Sam. xix. 18)--or, as the word probably means, in the collection of students' dwellings, inhabited by the sons of the prophets, where possibly there may have been some kind of right of sanctuary. Driven thence by Saul's following him, and having had one last sorrowful hour of Jonathan's companionship--the last but one on earth--he fled to Nob, whither  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/v_the_exilecontinued.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of David</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maspero/history_of_egypt_chaldaea_syria_babylonia_and_assyria_v_7/chapter_iitiglath-pileser_iii_and_the.htm">Tiglath-Pileser iii.
