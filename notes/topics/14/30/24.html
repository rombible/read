For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. 3. For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/a_loving_call_to_reunion.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/of_antichrist_and_his_ruin_.htm">Of Antichrist, and his Ruin: and of the Slaying the Witnesses. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">BY JOHN BUNYAN  PREFATORY REMARKS BY THE EDITOR This important treatise was prepared for the press, and left by the author, at his decease, to the care of his surviving friend for publication. It first appeared in a collection of his works in folio, 1692; and although a subject of universal interest; most admirably elucidated; no edition has been published in a separate form. Antichrist has agitated the Christian world from the earliest ages; and his craft has been to mislead the thoughtless, by  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/of_antichrist_and_his_ruin_.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Bunyan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of John Bunyan Volumes 1-3</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/the_new_temple_and_its.htm">The New Temple and Its Worship</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo: and they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 15.

His object in recording the early life of Jesus is not like that of Luke, viz., to communicate historical information to his readers.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_quotation_in_matt_ii.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_xii_covenanting_performed_in.htm">Covenanting Performed in Former Ages with Approbation from Above. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">That the Lord gave special token of his approbation of the exercise of Covenanting, it belongs to this place to show.
