By a thorough argumentation, Caspari has proved, that he occupies his right position in the Canon, and hence belongs to the earliest age of written prophecy, i.e., to the time of Jeroboam II. and Uzziah. As bearing conclusively against those who would assign to him a far later date, viz., the time of the exile, there is not only the indirect testimony borne by the place which this prophecy occupies in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophecy_of_obadiah.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_47_jericho_itself.htm">Jericho Itself. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">We read, that this city was not only wasted by Joshua with fire and sword, but cursed also. "Cursed be he before the Lord, who shall rise up and build that city Jericho," Joshua 6:26. "Nor was another city to be built (says the Talmudists), which was to be called by the name of Jericho: nor was Jericho itself to be built, although to be called by another name." And yet I know not by what chance this city crept out of dust and rubbish, lived again, and flourished, and became the second city to Jerusalem.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_47_jericho_itself.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_beatitudes_an_exposition_of_matthew_51-12/15_a_discourse_of_mercifulness.htm">A Discourse of Mercifulness</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.

There was never more need to preach of mercifulness than in these unmerciful times wherein we live. It is reported in the life of Chrysostom that he preached much on this subject of mercifulness, and for his much pressing Christians to mercy, he was called of many, the alms-preacher,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_beatitudes_an_exposition_of_matthew_51-12/15_a_discourse_of_mercifulness.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Watson&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Beatitudes: An Exposition of Matthew 5:1-12</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophet_joel.htm">The Prophet Joel. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">       PRELIMINARY REMARKS. The position which has been assigned to Joel in the collection of the Minor Prophets, furnishes an external argument for the determination of the time at which Joel wrote. There cannot be any doubt that the Collectors were guided by a consideration of the chronology. The circumstance, that they placed the prophecies of Joel just between the two prophets who, according to the inscriptions and contents of their prophecies, belonged to the time of Jeroboam and Uzziah, is  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophet_joel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/chronicles.htm">Chronicles</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The comparative indifference with which Chronicles is regarded in modern times by all but professional scholars seems to have been shared by the ancient Jewish church. Though written by the same hand as wrote Ezra-Nehemiah, and forming, together with these books, a continuous history of Judah, it is placed after them in the Hebrew Bible, of which it forms the concluding book; and this no doubt points to the fact that it attained canonical distinction later than they.
