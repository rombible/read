As it is my design to investigate the meaning of the Apocalyptical visions, it is requisite for me to treat, in the first place, of that celestial theatre to which John was called, in order to behold them, exhibited as on a stage, and afterwards of the prophecies in succession, examined by  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mede/a_key_to_the_apocalypse/the_first_part_.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Joseph Mede&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Key to the Apocalypse</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/finney/systematic_theology/lecture_xl_sanctification.htm">Sanctification. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">VI.
