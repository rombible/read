O Lord, Thou art our God; let not man prevail against Thee.'--2 CHRON. xiv. 11.  This King Asa, Rehoboam's grandson, had had a long reign of peace, which the writer of the Book of Chronicles traces to the fact that he had rooted out idolatry from Judah, 'The land had rest,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/asas_prayer.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/asas_reformation_and_consequent_peace.htm">Asa's Reformation, and Consequent Peace and victory</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God; 3.

ALFRED ROWLAND, D.D., LL.B.  1 KINGS xv. 8-24; 2 CHRON. xiv-xvi.  Asa was the third king who reigned over the separated kingdoms of Judah.  His father was Ahijah, of whom it is sternly said, "He walked in all the sins of his father, Rehoboam, which he had done before him."  A worse bringing-up than Asa's could scarcely be imagined.  As a child, and as a lad, he was grievously tempted by his father's example, and by the influence of an idolatrous court, which was crowded by flatterers and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/asa.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">George Milligan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Men of the Bible; Some Lesser-Known</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_divine_cordial/the_best_things_work_for.htm">The Best Things Work for Good to the Godly</a><br></span><span class="snippet">WE shall consider, first, what things work for good to the godly; and here we shall show that both the best things and the worst things work for their good. We begin with the best things. 1. God's attributes work for good to the godly. (1). God's power works for good. It is a glorious power (Col. i. 11), and it is engaged for the good of the elect. God's power works for good, in supporting us in trouble. "Underneath are the everlasting arms" (Deut. xxxiii. 27).

Though written by the same hand as wrote Ezra-Nehemiah, and forming, together with these books, a continuous history of Judah, it is placed after them in the Hebrew Bible, of which it forms the concluding book; and this no doubt points to the fact that it attained canonical distinction later than they. Nor is this unnatural.
