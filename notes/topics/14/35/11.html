I will suppose, dear friends, that in the providence of God you are in your place, and that by the direction of God's Spirit you have also sought and found the precise form of usefulness in which you ought to exercise yourself. To-night it shall not be my business to arrange you; but assuming that it is well for you to keep where you are,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_26_1880/cheer_up_my_comrades.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 26: 1880</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/the_new_temple_and_its.htm">The New Temple and Its Worship</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo: and they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 15.

That Jesus was indicated from the beginning as the Messiah -- though not a necessary part of his life and work, and wholly omitted by Mark and only briefly indicated in mystical language by John -- was a highly interesting and important fact in itself, and could not fail to impress the historian. The elaboration and detail of the first two chapters of the Gospel form a sufficient proof that Luke recognized  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/ramsay/was_christ_born_in_bethlehem/chapter_4_importance_in_lukes.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Sir William Mitchell Ramsay&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Was Christ Born in Bethlehem?</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_viii/sermon_vii_josiah_a_pattern.htm">Josiah, a Pattern for the Ignorant. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before Me; I also have heard thee, saith the Lord.

Though written by the same hand as wrote Ezra-Nehemiah, and forming, together with these books, a continuous history of Judah, it is placed after them in the Hebrew Bible, of which it forms the concluding book; and this no doubt points to the fact that it attained canonical distinction later than they.
