These words are the summing-up of the story of a strange old-world battle between Jeroboam, the adventurer who rent the kingdom, and Abijah, the son of the foolish Rehoboam, whose unseasonable blustering had played into the usurper's hands. The son was a wiser and better man than his father. It is characteristic of the ancient world, that before battle was joined Abijah made a long speech  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/the_secret_of_victory.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_53_ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a><br></span><span class="snippet">We mean not here the land of Ephraim, but a certain town in the confines of that land: of which you read 2 Chronicles 13:19; and of which the Talmudic writers speak: "What is the best flour," to be offered in the Temple?

Those of the Mishnaioth, in the eighth chapter, read, as we have writ it: the Tosaphtah also reads Michmas: but the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_53_ephraim.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/coleridge/confessions_of_an_inquiring_spirit_etc/letter_vi_in_my_last.htm">Letter vi.

I will now endeavour to state the argument, as between the former and the advocates for the popular belief,--such of them, I mean, as are competent to deliver a dispassionate judgment in the cause.  And again, more particularly, I mean the learned and reflecting part of them, who are influenced to the retention of the prevailing  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/coleridge/confessions_of_an_inquiring_spirit_etc/letter_vi_in_my_last.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit etc</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_20_beth-el_beth-aven.htm">Beth-El.

Let these last words be marked, "The breadth of the land of Benjamin was bounded by Jerusalem and Beth-el." May we not justly conclude, from these words, that Jerusalem and Beth-el were opposite, as it were, in a right line? But if you look upon the maps, there are some that separate these by a very large tract of land,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_20_beth-el_beth-aven.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/chronicles.htm">Chronicles</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The comparative indifference with which Chronicles is regarded in modern times by all but professional scholars seems to have been shared by the ancient Jewish church. Though written by the same hand as wrote Ezra-Nehemiah, and forming, together with these books, a continuous history of Judah, it is placed after them in the Hebrew Bible, of which it forms the concluding book; and this no doubt points to the fact that it attained canonical distinction later than they.
