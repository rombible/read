We should go home and first break our false gods; next, cut down the very groves in which we have been wont to delight, and after that break the altars which though dedicated to the God of Israel, are not according to Scripture, and therefore ought to be broken down, albeit, they be even dedicated to the true  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_5_1859/reform.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 5: 1859</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/yeardley/memoir_and_diary_of_john_yeardley_minister_of_the_gospel/chapter_xxi_last_journey_and.htm">Last Journey and Death, 1858 --Concluding Remarks. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">We are now arrived at the closing scene of John Yeardley's labors. The impression which he had received, during his visit to Turkey in 1853, of the opening for the work of the Gospel in the Eastern countries, had never been obliterated; it had rather grown deeper with time, although his ability to accomplish such an undertaking had proportionately diminished. This consideration, however, could not satisfy his awakened sympathies, and, according to his apprehension, no other course remained for him  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/yeardley/memoir_and_diary_of_john_yeardley_minister_of_the_gospel/chapter_xxi_last_journey_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Yeardley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Memoir and Diary of John Yeardley, Minister of the Gospel</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/pink/tithing/part_2.htm">Tithing</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it" (Mal. 3:10). Down deep in the heart of every Christian there is undoubtedly the conviction that he ought to tithe. There is an uneasy feeling that this is a duty which has been neglected, or, if you prefer it, a privilege that has not been  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/pink/tithing/part_2.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Arthur W.

A careful study of them will show how wholehearted love and service is what God has always asked, because He can, in the very nature of things, ask nothing less. The prayerful and believing acceptance of the words will waken the assurance that such wholehearted love and service is exactly the blessing the New Covenant was meant to make possible.

Though written by the same hand as wrote Ezra-Nehemiah, and forming, together with these books, a continuous history of Judah, it is placed after them in the Hebrew Bible, of which it forms the concluding book; and this no doubt points to the fact that it attained canonical distinction later than they. Nor is this unnatural.
