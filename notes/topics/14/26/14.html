Benjamin, in the order backward, thus,--"Joppah, Jabneh, Azotus." That is Jabneh with this author, that is Jaminia with the other. A remembrance of this place is in 2 Chronicles 26:6: but the chief fame of it is for the Sanhedrim, that was placed there, both before the destruction of Jerusalem and after. Rabban Gamaliel, St. Paul's master, first presided there.

Accordingly Simon would not suffer Matthias, by whose means he got possession of the city, to go off without torment. This Matthias was the son of Boethus, and was one of the high priests, one that had been very faithful to the people, and in great esteem with them; he, when the multitude were distressed by the zealots, among whom John was numbered, persuaded the people to admit this Simon to come in to assist them, while he had made no terms with him, nor expected any thing that was evil from  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/josephus/the_wars_of_the_jews_or_history_of_the_destruction_of_jerusalem/chapter_13_the_great_slaughters.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Flavius Josephus&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Wars of the Jews or History of the Destruction of Jerusalem</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/i_of_preparation.htm">Of Preparation. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">That a Christian ought necessarily to prepare himself before he presume to be a partaker of the holy communion, may evidently appear by five reasons:-- First, Because it is God's commandment; for if he commanded, under the pain of death, that none uncircumcised should eat the paschal lamb (Exod. xii. 48), nor any circumcised under four days preparation, how much greater preparation does he require of him that comes to receive the sacrament of his body and blood? which, as it succeeds, so doth it  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/i_of_preparation.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Lewis Bayly&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Practice of Piety</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_ten_commandments/1_1_obedience.htm">Obedience</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the Lord thy God.

It is not enough to hear God's voice, but we must obey. Obedience is a part of the honour we owe to God. If then I be a Father, where is my honour?' Mal 1: 6.
