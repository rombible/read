J. G. GREENHOUGH, M.A.  "And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, by coming to Joram; for, when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab."--2 CHRON. xxii. 7.  We rarely read this part of the Bible.  And I do not wonder at it.  For those particular chapters are undoubtedly dreary and monotonous.  They contain the names of a number of incompetent and worthless kings who did nothing that was worth writing  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/ahaziah.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">George Milligan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Men of the Bible; Some Lesser-Known</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/murray/the_two_covenants/note_f_chap_xviii_the_whole.htm">The Whole Heart</a><br></span><span class="snippet">LET me give the principal passages in which the words "the whole heart," "all the heart," are used. A careful study of them will show how wholehearted love and service is what God has always asked, because He can, in the very nature of things, ask nothing less. The prayerful and believing acceptance of the words will waken the assurance that such wholehearted love and service is exactly the blessing the New Covenant was meant to make possible. That assurance will prepare us for turning to the Omnipotence  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/murray/the_two_covenants/note_f_chap_xviii_the_whole.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Andrew Murray&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Two Covenants</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/chronicles.htm">Chronicles</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The comparative indifference with which Chronicles is regarded in modern times by all but professional scholars seems to have been shared by the ancient Jewish church. Though written by the same hand as wrote Ezra-Nehemiah, and forming, together with these books, a continuous history of Judah, it is placed after them in the Hebrew Bible, of which it forms the concluding book; and this no doubt points to the fact that it attained canonical distinction later than they. Nor is this unnatural.
