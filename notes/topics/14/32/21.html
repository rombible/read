XXXII. 1.  The Revised Version gives a much more accurate and significant rendering of a part of these words. It reads: 'After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came.' What are 'these things' and 'this faithfulness'? The former are the whole of the events connected with the religious reformation in Judah, which King Hezekiah inaugurated and carried through so brilliantly  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/a_strange_reward_for_faithfulness.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_24_some_buildings_in.htm">Some Buildings in Acra.
