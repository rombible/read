But it is not narrated in the gospels that He ate His own body or drank His own blood. Therefore we must not assert this as a fact. Objection 2: Further, nothing can be within itself except perchance by reason of its parts, for instance. as one part is in another, as is stated in Phys. iv.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_christ_received_his_own.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_judicial_precepts_regarding.htm">Whether the Judicial Precepts Regarding Foreigners were Framed in a Suitable Manner?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that the judicial precepts regarding foreigners were not suitably framed. For Peter said (Acts 10:34,35): "In very deed I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons, but in every nation, he that feareth Him and worketh justice is acceptable to Him." But those who are acceptable to God should not be excluded from the Church of God.

[We learn from verse 40 that the Pharisee's name was Simon. Because the feast at Bethany was given in the house of Simon the leper, and because Jesus was anointed there also, some have been led to think that Luke is here describing this supper.
