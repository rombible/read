For, we have no need of grace for what we can accomplish naturally. But the angel naturally turns to God: because he loves God naturally, as is clear from what has been said ([543]Q[60], A[5]). Therefore an angel did not need grace in order to turn to God. Objection 2: Further, seemingly we need help only for difficult tasks. Now it was not a difficult task for the angel to turn to God; because there was no obstacle  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_an_angel_needs_grace.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_ten_commandments/3_1_mans_inability_to_keep.htm">Man's Inability to Keep the Moral Law</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Is any man able perfectly to keep the commandments of God? No mere man, since the fall, is able in this life perfectly to keep the commandments of God, but does daily break them, in thought, word, and deed. In many things we offend all.' James 3: 2. Man in his primitive state of innocence, was endowed with ability to keep the whole moral law. He had rectitude of mind, sanctity of will, and perfection of power. He had the copy of God's law written on his heart; no sooner did God command but he obeyed.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_ten_commandments/3_1_mans_inability_to_keep.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Watson&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ten Commandments</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/lamentations.htm">Lamentations</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The book familiarly known as the Lamentations consists of four elegies[1] (i., ii., iii., iv.) and a prayer (v.). The general theme of the elegies is the sorrow and desolation created by the destruction of Jerusalem[2] in 586 B.C.: the last poem (v.) is a prayer for deliverance from the long continued distress. The elegies are all alphabetic, and like most alphabetic poems (cf. Ps. cxix.) are marked by little continuity of thought.
