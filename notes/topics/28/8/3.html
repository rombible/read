We see from our text that God looks upon man; for he says of Ephraim, "I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing." But see how, when he observes the sin of man, he does not dash him away and spurn him with his foot; he does not shake him by the neck over the gulf of hell, until his brain doth reel and then drop him forever; but  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_1_1855/the_bible.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 1: 1855</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/law/an_humble_affectionate_and_earnest_address_to_the_clergy/address_167_0_0_and_first_can.htm">And First, Can it be Said that Mammmon is Less Served by Christians...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">And first, can it be said that Mammmon is less served by Christians, than by Jews and infidels?
