Nothing keeps us from advancement more than ruts and drifts, and wheel-tracks into which our chariots roll and then move on in the narrow line with unchanging monotony, currents in life's stream on which we are borne in the old direction until the law of habit almost makes advance impossible. The true remedy for this is to commence at nothing; taking Christ afresh to be the Alpha and Omega for a deeper, higher, Divine experience, waiting even for His conception  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/december_4_from_me_is.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
