Solomon, &c. rightly do. We read of a double Beth-horon in the Old Testament, but one only under the second Temple...

See 1 Samuel 22:6; "Saul sat in Gibeah, under a grove in Ramah." Here the Gemarists trifle: "Whence is it (say they) that Ramah is placed near Gibea? To hint to you, that the speech of Samuel of Ramah was the cause, why Saul remained two years and a half in Gibeah."

May we not justly conclude, from these words, that Jerusalem and Beth-el were opposite, as it were, in a right line?
