JOSHUA v. 14.  The army of Israel was just beginning a hard conflict under an untried leader. Behind them the Jordan barred their retreat, in front of them Jericho forbade their advance. Most of them had never seen a fortified city, and had no experience nor engines for a siege. So we may well suppose that many doubts and fears shook the courage of the host, as it drew around the doomed city. Their chief had his own heavy burden.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/the_captain_of_the_lords.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_rite_of_circumcision.htm">Whether the Rite of Circumcision was Fitting?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It seems that the rite of circumcision was unfitting. For circumcision, as stated above ([4474]AA[1],2), was a profession of faith. But faith is in the apprehensive power, whose operations appear mostly in the head. Therefore the sign of circumcision should have been conferred on the head rather than on the virile member. Objection 2: Further, in the sacraments we make use of such things as are in more frequent use; for instance, water, which is used for washing, and bread, which we  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_rite_of_circumcision.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_circumcision_bestowed_sanctifying_grace.htm">Whether Circumcision Bestowed Sanctifying Grace?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It seems that circumcision did not bestow sanctifying grace. For the Apostle says (Gal. 2:21): "If justice be by the Law, then Christ died in vain," i.e. without cause. But circumcision was an obligation imposed by the Law, according to Gal. 5:3: "I testify . . . to every man circumcising himself, that ne is a debtor to do the whole law." Therefore, if justice be by circumcision, "Christ died in vain," i.e. without cause. But this cannot be allowed.
