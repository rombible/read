EPHESIANS vi. 11. Put on the whole armour of God. St. Paul again and again compares himself and the Christians to whom he writes to soldiers, and their lives to warfare.  And it was natural that he should do so.  Everywhere he went, in those days, he would find Roman soldiers, ruling over men of different races from themselves, and ruling them, on the whole, well.

The military metaphor of which this verse is the beginning was obviously deeply imprinted on Paul's mind. It is found in a comparatively incomplete form in his earliest epistle, the first to the Thessalonians, in which the children of the day are exhorted to put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. It reappears, in a slightly  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_panoply_of_god.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_girdle_of_truth.htm"> 'The Girdle of Truth'</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Stand, therefore, having girded your loins with truth.'--Eph. vi. 14 (R.V.).  The general exhortation here points to the habitual attitude of the Christian soldier. However many conflicts he may have waged, he is still to be ever ready for fresh assaults, for in regard to them he may be quite sure that to-morrow will bring its own share of them, and that the evil day is never left behind so long as days still last.

There can be no doubt that in this whole context the Apostle has in mind the great passage in Isaiah lix. where the prophet, in a figure of extreme boldness, describes the Lord as arming Himself to deliver the oppressed faithful, and coming as a Redeemer to Zion. In that passage the Lord puts on righteousness as a breastplate--that is to say, God, in His manifestation of Himself for the deliverance of His people, comes forth as if arrayed  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_breastplate_of_righteousness.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/a_soldiers_shoes.htm">A Soldier's Shoes</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.'--Eph. vi. 15.  Paul drew the first draft of this picture of the Christian armour in his first letter. It is a finished picture here. One can fancy that the Roman soldier to whom he was chained in his captivity, whilst this letter was being written, unconsciously sat for his likeness, and that each piece of his accoutrements was seized in succession by the Apostle's imagination and turned to a Christian use.

There were two kinds of shields in use in ancient warfare--one smaller, carried upon the arm, and which could be used, by a movement of the arm, for the defence of threatened parts of the body in detail; the other large, planted in front of the soldier, fixed in the ground, and all but covering his whole person.

We may, perhaps, trace a certain progress in the enumeration of the various pieces of the Christian armour in this context. Roughly speaking, they are in three divisions. There are first our graces of truth, righteousness, preparedness, which, though they are all conceived as given by God, are yet the exercises of our own powers. There is next, standing alone, as befits its all-comprehensive character, faith which is able to ward against and overcome  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_helmet_of_salvation.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_sword_of_the_spirit.htm"> 'The Sword of the Spirit'</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.'--Eph. vi. 17.  We reach here the last and only offensive weapon in the panoply. The 'of' here does not indicate apposition, as in the 'shield of faith,' or 'the helmet of salvation,' nor is it the 'of' of possession, so that the meaning is to be taken as being the sword which the Spirit wields, but it is the 'of' expressing origin, as in the 'armour of God'; it is the sword which the Spirit supplies.

The numerous personal greetings usually found at the close of Paul's letters are entirely absent from this Epistle. All which we have in their place is this entirely general good wish, and the still more general and wider one in the subsequent verse. There is but one other of the Apostle's letters similarly devoid of personal messages, viz. the Epistle to the Galatians, and their absence there is sufficiently accounted for by the severe  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/peace_love_and_faith.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_wide_range_of_gods.htm">The Wide Range of God's Grace</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.'--Eph. vi. 24.
