These three texts should be read together, and the significant change found in each text as the thought unfolds should be studied carefully.

That is Paul's way of describing a church. There were plenty of very imperfect Christians in the community at Ephesus and in the other Asiatic churches to which this letter went. As we know, there were heretics amongst them, and many others to whom the designation of 'holy' seemed inapplicable. But Paul classes them all under one category, and describes the whole body of believing people by these two words, which must  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/saints_and_faithful.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_earnest_and_the_inheritance.htm">The Earnest and the Inheritance</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'The earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession.'--Eph. i. 14.  I have dealt with a portion of this verse in conjunction with the fragment of another in this chapter. I tried to show you how much the idea of the mutual possession of God by the believing soul, and of the believing soul by God, was present to the Apostle's thoughts in this context. These two ideas are brought into close juxtaposition in the verse before us, for, as you will see if you use the Revised  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_earnest_and_the_inheritance.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_hope_of_the_calling.htm">The Hope of the Calling</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'That ye may know what is the hope of His calling.'--Eph. i. 18.  A man's prayers for others are a very fair thermometer of his own religious condition. What he asks for them will largely indicate what he thinks best for himself; and how he asks it will show the firmness of his own faith and the fervour of his own feeling. There is nothing colder than the intercession of a cold Christian; and, on the other hand, in no part of the fervid Apostle Paul's writings do his words come more winged and fast,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_hope_of_the_calling.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/gods_inheritance_in_the_saints.htm">God's Inheritance in the Saints</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'That ye may know what is the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.'--Eph. i. 18.  The misery of Hope is that it so often owes its materials to the strength of our desires or to the activity of our imagination. But when mere wishes or fancies spin the thread, Hope cannot weave a lasting fabric. And so one of the old prophets, in speaking of the delusive hopes of man, says that they are like 'spiders' webs,' and 'shall not become garments.'

It is very characteristic of Paul's impetuous fervour and exuberant faith that he begins this letter with a doxology, and plunges at once into the very heart of his theme. Colder natures reach such heights by slow degrees. He gains them at a bound, or rather, he dwells there always. Put a pen into his hand, and it is like tapping a blast furnace; and out rushes a fiery stream at white  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/all_spiritual_blessings.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/according_toii.htm"> 'According To' --II. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">'According to the riches of His grace.'--Eph. i. 7.  We have seen, in a previous sermon, that a characteristic note of this letter is the frequent occurrence of that phrase 'according to.' I also then pointed out that it was employed in two different directions. One class of passages, with which I then tried to deal, used it to compare the divine purpose in our salvation with the historical process of the salvation. The type of that class of reference is found in a verse just before my text, 'according  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/according_toii.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/gods_inheritance_and_ours.htm">God's Inheritance and Ours</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, ... the earnest of our inheritance.'--Eph. i. 11, 14.  A dewdrop twinkles into green and gold as the sunlight falls on it. A diamond flashes many colours as its facets catch the light. So, in this context, the Apostle seems to be haunted with that thought of 'inheriting' and 'inheritance,' and he recurs to it several times, but sets it at different angles, and it flashes back different beauties of radiance.

'The riches of the glory of the inheritance' will sometimes quench rather than stimulate hope. He can have little depth of religion who has not often felt that the transcendent glory of that promised future sharpens the doubt--'and can I ever hope to reach it?'

I reckon twelve instances of it in three chapters of the letter, and they all introduce one or other of the two thoughts which appear in the two fragments that I have taken for my text.
