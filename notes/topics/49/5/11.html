They do not refer to time in general, but to a special point of time, a juncture, a crisis, a moment full of possibilities and quickly passing by, which we must seize and make the best of before it has passed away.

But, though the expression is unique, the idea underlies the whole teaching of the New Testament on the subject of Christian character and conduct.
