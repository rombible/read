But prayer is the link that connects us with God. This is the bridge that spans every gulf and bears us over every abyss of danger or of need.

The narrative of Peter's miraculous deliverance from prison is full of little vivid touches which can only have come from himself. The whole tone of it reminds us of the Gospel according to St. Mark, which is in like manner stamped with peculiar minuteness and abundance of detail.
