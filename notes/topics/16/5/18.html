So did not I, because of the fear of God.'--Neh. v. 15.  I do not suppose that the ordinary Bible-reader knows very much about Nehemiah. He is one of the neglected great men of Scripture. He was no prophet, he had no glowing words, he had no lofty visions, he had no special commission, he did not live in the heroic age. There was a certain harshness and dryness; a tendency towards what, when it was more fully developed, became Pharisaism, in the man, which somewhat covers the essential nobleness  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/an_ancient_nonconformist.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/youthful_confessors.htm">Youthful Confessors</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 9.

Hence, there was little need of writing them down.
