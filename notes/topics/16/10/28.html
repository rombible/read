For the New Testament simply transports us among contemporary scenes and actors, taking the then existent state of things, so to speak, for granted. But the fact referred to explains many seemingly strange circumstances, and casts fresh light upon all.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_14_the_fraternity_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sketches of Jewish Social Life</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/xiii_the_formation_of_the.htm">The Formation of the Old Testament Canon</a><br></span><span class="snippet">[Sidenote: Israel's literature at the beginning of the fourth century before Christ] Could we have studied the scriptures of the Israelitish race about 400 B.C., we should have classified them under four great divisions: (1) The prophetic writings, represented by the combined early Judean, Ephraimite, and late prophetic or Deuteronomic narratives, and their continuation in Samuel and Kings, together with the earlier and exilic prophecies; (2) the legal, represented by the majority of the Old Testament  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/xiii_the_formation_of_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Foster Kent&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Origin & Permanent Value of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/ix_influences_that_gave_rise.htm">Influences that Gave Rise to the Priestly Laws and Histories</a><br></span><span class="snippet">[Sidenote: Influences in the exile that produced written ceremonial laws] The Babylonian exile gave a great opportunity and incentive to the further development of written law. While the temple stood, the ceremonial rites and customs received constant illustration, and were transmitted directly from father to son in the priestly families. Hence, there was little need of writing them down.
