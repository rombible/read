The condition of our great cities has lately been forced upon public attention, and all kinds of men have been offering their panaceas. I am not about to enter upon that discussion, but I am glad to seize the opportunity of saying one or two things which I think very much need to be said to individual Christian people about their duty in the matter. 'Every man over against his house' is the principle I desire to commend to you  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/over_against_his_house.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_57_1911/the_broad_wall.htm">The Broad Wall</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"The broad wall."--Nehemiah 3:8. IT SEEMS that around Jerusalem of old, in the time of her splendor, there was a broad wall, which was her defence and her glory. Jerusalem is a type of the Church of God. It is always well when we can see clearly, distinctly, and plainly, that around the Church to which we belong there runs a broad wall. This idea of a broad wall around the Church suggests three things: separation, security, and enjoyment. Let us examine each of these in its turn. I.
