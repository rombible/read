Ninety years had passed since the returning exiles had arrived at Jerusalem. They had encountered many difficulties which had marred their progress and cooled their enthusiasm. The Temple, indeed, was rebuilt, but Jerusalem lay in ruins, and its walls remained as they had been left, by Nebuchadnezzar's siege, some century and a half before.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/the_church_and_social_evils.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/a_reformers_schooling.htm">A Reformer's Schooling</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.

Hence, there was little need of writing them down.
