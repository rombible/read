Self love is generally esteemed infamous and contemptible among men. It is of a bad report every where, and indeed as it is taken commonly, there is good reason for it, that it should be hissed out of all societies, if reproaching and speaking evil of it would do it. But to speak the truth, the name is not so fit to express the thing, for that which men call self love, may rather be called self hatred.

While the temple stood, the ceremonial rites and customs received constant illustration, and were transmitted directly from father to son in the priestly families. Hence, there was little need of writing them down. But when most of the priests were carried captive to Babylonia, as in 597 B.C., and ten years later the temple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/ix_influences_that_gave_rise.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Foster Kent&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Origin & Permanent Value of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/ezra-nehemiah.htm">Ezra-Nehemiah</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Some of the most complicated problems in Hebrew history as well as in the literary criticism of the Old Testament gather about the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.
