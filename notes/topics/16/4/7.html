Nehemiah, and the Jews with him, were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. Sanballat and others were angry with them, and tried to stop the work. They determined to pounce upon the people on a sudden, and slay them, and so to put an end to what they were doing. Our text tells us what Nehemiah and his companions did in this emergency: "Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_38_1892/the_two_guards_praying_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 38: 1892</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/various/the_sermons_and_addresses_at_the_seabury_centenary/centenary_commemoration_of_the_consecration.htm">Centenary Commemoration of the Consecration of Bishop Seabury. 1884. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">THE RT.

Jerome, after lamenting that Origen's notes on the psalm are no longer extant, gives the following explanations: The Hebrew phrase "bread of sorrow" is rendered by the LXX. "bread of idols"; by Aquila, "bread of troubles"; by Symmachus, "bread of misery." Theodotion follows the LXX. So does Origen's Fifth Version.
