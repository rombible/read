When work is pressing there are many little things that will come and seem to need attention. Then it is a very blessed thing to be quiet and still, and work on, and trust the little things with God. He answers such trust in a wonderful way. If the soul has no time to fret and worry and harbor care, it has learned the secret of faith in God. A desperate desire to get some difficulty right takes the eye off of God and His glory.

THIS servant of God had come down from Babylon to rebuild the temple and re-establish the worship of God at Jerusalem, the city of his fathers' sepulchres. When it was discovered by Sanballat and certain individuals, his allies, who had long enjoyed the desolations of Zion, that now the temple, and the holy city were about to be rebuilt, they raised a great  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/finney/lectures_on_revivals_of_religion/lecture_xv_hindrances_to_revivals.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Grandison Finney&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Lectures on Revivals of Religion</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_17_sharon_caphar_lodim.htm">Sharon.
