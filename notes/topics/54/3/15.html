Christ's humiliation consisted in his incarnation, his taking flesh, and being born. It was real flesh that Christ took; not the image of a body (as the Manichees erroneously held), but a true body; therefore he  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_body_of_divinity/6_christs_humiliation_in_his.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Watson&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Body of Divinity</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/roberston/sketches_of_church_history_from_ad_33_to_the_reformation/chapter_xx_st_john_chrysostom.htm">St. John Chrysostom (Ad 347-407)</a><br></span><span class="snippet">PART I At this time lived St. John Chrysostom, whose name is known to us all from the prayer in our service which is called "A Prayer of St. Chrysostom."
