For thousands of years men have been writing books.  Most books are forgotten soon after they are written; a few of the best and wisest are remembered for a time. But all at last grow old; new discoveries are made; new ideas arise; the old books are out of date; their usefulness is at an end.  Students are the only people who still care to read them.
