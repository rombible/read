And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market-place, and said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/arnot/the_parables_of_our_lord/ix_the_vineyard_labourers.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">William Arnot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Parables of Our Lord</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/on_the_good_of_marriage/section_7_but_i_marvel.htm">But I Marvel, If, as it is Allowed to Put Away a Wife Who...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">7. But I marvel, if, as it is allowed to put away a wife who is an adulteress, so it be allowed, having put her away, to marry another.
