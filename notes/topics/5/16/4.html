At that time, "Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven," were gathered together at Jerusalem, to keep the Feast of Pentecost (or Feast of Weeks), which was one of the three holy seasons at which God required His people to appear before Him in the place which He had chosen (Deuteronomy xvi. 16).

For unseemly joy results from every sin, according to Prov. 2:14, "Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in most wicked things." Likewise dullness of mind is associated with every sin, according to Prov. 14:22, "They err that work evil."

Now vainglory is reckoned a capital vice. Therefore pride also should be reckoned a capital vice. Objection 3: Further, Augustine says (De Virginit. xxxi) that "pride begets envy, nor is it ever without this  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_pride_should_be_reckoned.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_h/the_passing_and_the_permanent.htm">The Passing and the Permanent</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.'--ISAIAH liv, 10.--  There is something of music in the very sound of these words.
