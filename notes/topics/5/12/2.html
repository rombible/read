There were three bloody sacrifices, the sin-offering, the burnt- offering, and the peace-offering.

There is at first only the general promise that the seed of the woman should obtain the victory over the kingdom of the evil one;--then, that the salvation should come through the descendants of Shem;--then, from among them Abraham is marked out,--of his sons, Isaac,--from among his sons, Jacob,--and from among the twelve sons  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_promise_in_2_samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/xii_the_kingcontinued.htm">The King --Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The second event recorded as important in the bright early years is the great promise of the perpetuity of the kingdom in David's house. As soon as the king was firmly established and free from war, he remembered the ancient word which said, "When He giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety, then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there" (Deut. xii. 10, 11).

In the first section, i.-iv. 40, Moses, after reviewing the recent history of the people, and showing how it reveals Jehovah's love for Israel, earnestly urges upon them the duty of keeping His laws, reminding them of His spirituality and absoluteness.
