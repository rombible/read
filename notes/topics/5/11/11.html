"We that have believed do enter into rest;" but you, though you have eaten of Jesus, have not so believed on him as to have entered into the Canaan of rest. You are the Lord's people, but you have not come into the Canaan of assured faith, confidence, and hope, where we wrestle no longer with flesh and blood, but with principalities and powers in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus--when  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_2_1856/canaan_on_earth.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 2: 1856</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/the_gospel_of_the_pentateuch/sermon_xvii_the_god_of.htm">The God of the Rain</a><br></span><span class="snippet">(Fifth Sunday after Easter.) DEUT. xi.  11, 12.  The land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven.  A land which the Lord thy God careth for:  the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year.

Some take it in that sense, as if it were near to Gilgal: some far off from Gilgal: the Targumists read, "before Gilgal": while, as I think, they do not touch the difficulty; which lies not so much in the signification of the word Mul, as in the ambiguity of the word Gilgal.

Moreover, the remark has not an independent import; it serves only to prepare the way for the communication of the subsequent account of Noah's drunkenness.
