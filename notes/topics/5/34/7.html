Some might regret that the last three chapters of Deuteronomy are not read among our Sunday lessons.  There was not, however, room for them; and I do not doubt that those who chose our lessons knew better than I what chapters  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/the_gospel_of_the_pentateuch/sermon_xviii_the_death_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Gospel of the Pentateuch</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_vii/sermon_ix_moses_the_type.htm">Moses the Type of Christ. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye shall hearken."--Deut. xviii. 15.  The history of Moses is valuable to Christians, not only as giving us a pattern of fidelity towards God, of great firmness, and great meekness, but also as affording us a type or figure of our Saviour Christ.  No prophet arose in Israel like Moses, till Christ came, when the promise in the text was fulfilled--"The Lord thy God," says Moses, "shall  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_vii/sermon_ix_moses_the_type.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Henry Newman&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Parochial and Plain Sermons, Vol. VII</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/on_care_to_be_had_for_the_dead_/18_so_then_we_must.htm">So Then we must Confess that the Dead Indeed do not Know what Is...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">18.

Of this mountain mention is made, Joshua 2:22, where the two spies, sent by Joshua, and received by Rahab, are said to "conceal themselves."

In the first section, i.-iv. 40, Moses, after reviewing the recent history of the people, and showing how it reveals Jehovah's love for Israel, earnestly urges upon them the duty of keeping His laws, reminding them of His spirituality and absoluteness.
