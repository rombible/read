You may divide the subterraneous country into three parts: the metal mines, the caves, and the places of burial. This land was eminently noted for metal mines, so that "its stones," in very many places, "were iron, and out of its hills was digged brass," Deuteronomy 8:9. From these gain accrued to the Jews: but to the Christians, not seldom slavery and misery; being frequently condemned hither by  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_99_subterraneous_places_mines.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bevan/hymns_of_ter_steegen_suso_and_others/emmanuels_land.htm">Emmanuel's Land</a><br></span><span class="snippet">P.

The grand reason why all things work for good, is the near and dear interest which God has in His people. The Lord has made a covenant with them. "They shall be my people, and I will be their God" (Jer. xxxii. 38). By virtue of this compact, all things do, and must work, for good to them. "I am God, even thy God" (Psalm l. 7). This word, Thy God,' is the sweetest word in the Bible, it implies the best relations; and it is impossible there should be these relations between God and His people, and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_divine_cordial/why_all_things_work_for.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Watson&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Divine Cordial</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/grace_abounding_to_the_chief.htm">Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners:</a><br></span><span class="snippet">A BRIEF AND FAITHFUL RELATION OF THE EXCEEDING MERCY OF GOD IN CHRIST TO HIS POOR SERVANT, JOHN BUNYAN; WHEREIN IS PARTICULARLY SHOWED THE MANNER OF HIS CONVERSION, HIS SIGHT AND TROUBLE FOR SIN, HIS DREADFUL TEMPTATIONS, ALSO HOW HE DESPAIRED OF GOD'S MERCY, AND HOW THE LORD AT LENGTH THROUGH CHRIST DID DELIVER HIM FROM ALL THE GUILT AND TERROR THAT LAY UPON HIM.
