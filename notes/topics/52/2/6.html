(1 Thessalonians 2:13.)  THE Apostle here testifies that he believes himself to be the bearer of a revelation direct from God; that the words he speaks and the words he writes are not the words of man, but the Word of God, warm with his breath, filled with his thoughts, and stamped with his will. In this same epistle he writes: "For this we say unto  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/haldeman/christ_christianity_and_the_bible/the_bible.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">I.

In order to hear, the sinner, deaf by nature, must receive hearing ears. "He that hath ears let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches." (Rev. ii. 7, 11, 17, 29; iii. 6, 13, 22). But by nature the sinner does not belong to these favored ones. This is a daily experience. Of two clerks in the same office, one obeys the call and the other rejects it; not because he despises it, but because he does not hear God's call in it.

It is, in the first place, unquestionable that a real serpent was engaged in the temptation; so that the opinion of those who maintain that the serpent is only  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_protevangelium.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_body_of_divinity/2_effectual_calling.htm">Effectual Calling</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Them he also called.'
