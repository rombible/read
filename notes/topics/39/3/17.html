November, 1874. Malachi iii. 1, 2.  "The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His  temple. . . .  But who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall  stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner's fire, and like  fuller's sope." We believe that this prophecy was fulfilled at the first coming of our  Lord Jesus Christ.  We believe that it will be fulfilled again, in that  great day when He shall judge the quick and the dead.  But it is of  neither of these events  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/all_saints_day_and_other_sermons/sermon_iv_the_lord_coming.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">All Saints' Day and Other Sermons</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/january_19_prove_me_now.htm">January 19. "Prove Me Now Herewith" (Mal. Iii. 10). </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"Prove me now herewith" (Mal. iii. 10). We once heard a simple old colored man say something that we have never forgotten. "When God tests You it is a good time for you to test Him by putting His promises to the proof, and claiming from Him just as much as your trials have rendered necessary." There are two ways of getting out of a trial. One is to simply try to get rid of the trial, and be thankful when it is over. The other is to recognize the trial as a challenge from God to claim a larger blessing  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/january_19_prove_me_now.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.

MALACHI iii. 6. The scriptural revelations of the divine Name are always the basis of intensely practical admonition. The Bible does not think it worth while to proclaim the Name of God without building on the proclamation promises or commandments. There is no 'mere theology' in Scripture; and it does not speak of 'attributes,' nor give dry abstractions of infinitude, eternity, omniscience, unchangeableness, but lays stress  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/the_unchanging_lord.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/a_dialogue_with_god_3.htm">A Dialogue with God</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Return unto Me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts.

For the Philosopher says (De Coelo ii) that "things which are in a state of perfection possess their good without movement." But Christ was in a state of perfection, since He is the Sovereign Good in respect of His Divine Nature, and sovereignly glorified in respect of His human nature. Consequently, He has His good without movement. But ascension is movement. Therefore it was not fitting for Christ to ascend.

But God is wisdom itself; therefore God is movable.
