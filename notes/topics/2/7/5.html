They were not foretellers, but forth-tellers. Instead of being vague dreamers, in imagination living far in the distant future, they were most emphatically men of their own times, enlightened and devoted patriots, social and ethical reformers, and spiritual  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/vii_the_history_of_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Foster Kent&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Origin & Permanent Value of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/jerome/the_principal_works_of_st_jerome/letter_lxxxv_to_paulinus.htm">Letter Lxxxv. To Paulinus. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Paulinus had asked Jerome two questions, (1) how can certain passages of scripture (Exod. vii. 13; Rom. ix. 16) be reconciled with Free Will? and (2) Why are the children of believers said to be holy (1 Cor. vii. 14) apart from baptismal grace? For the first of these questions Jerome refers Paulinus to his version (newly made) of Origen's treatise, On First Principles. For the second he quotes the explanation of Tertullian.

The Scripture teaches positively that the hardening and "darkening of their foolish heart" is a divine, intentional act. This is plainly evident from God's charge to Moses concerning the king of Egypt: "Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not harken unto you, and I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xxxiii_the_hardening_in_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/epistle_sermons_vol_iii/sixteenth_sunday_after_trinity_pauls.htm">Sixteenth Sunday after Trinity Paul's Care and Prayer for the Church. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Text: Ephesians 3, 13-21. 13.

Ultimately it is Israel's God that is her redeemer, but He operates largely by human means; and the first step is the preparation of a deliverer, Moses, whose parentage,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/exodus.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/egypt.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/nile_river.htm">Nile River</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bring.htm">Bring</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/forth.htm">Forth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/midst.htm">Midst</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sons.htm">Sons</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stretch.htm">Stretch</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stretched.htm">Stretched</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stretching.htm">Stretching</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Moses and Aaron are encouraged to go again to Pharaoh</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-8.htm">Aaron's rod is turned into a serpent</a></span><br><span class="reftext">11. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm">The sorcerers do the like; but their rods are swallowed up by Aaron's</a></span><br><span class="reftext">13. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-13.htm">Pharaoh's heart is hardened</a></span><br><span class="reftext">14. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm">God's message to Pharaoh</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">The river is turned into blood; and the consequent distress of the Egyptians</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1235.htm"><b>1235</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, <i>the <span class="sc">LORD</span></i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1403.htm"><b>1403</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, <i>revelation</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5029.htm"><b>5029</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge, <i>of God</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5816.htm"><b>5816</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/7949.htm"><b>7949</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mission, <i>of Israel</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8135.htm"><b>8135</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowing God, <i>nature of</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1-7</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5102.htm"><b>5102</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses, <i>life of</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-4.htm">Exodus 7:4-5</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/9210.htm"><b>9210</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment, <i>God's</i></a></body></html>
