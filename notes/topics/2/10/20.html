The mandate has gone forth to earth and hell: "Thus saith the Lord, let my people go that they may serve me." "No," saith Satan, "they shall not." And if he be compelled to yield one point, he still retains his hold upon another. If he must give way, it shall be inch by inch. Evil is hard in dying; it will not readily be overcome. But this is the demand of God, and to he last  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_6_1860/full_redemption.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 6: 1860</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_37_1891/a_poor_mans_cry_and.htm">A Poor Man's Cry, and what came of It</a><br></span><span class="snippet">On this occasion I want to speak of what happens to those who do return to God; because many have newly been brought, through mighty grace.

They tell me that they did distinctly lay hold on eternal life last Sabbath day; and they are clear about what it means. They came out of darkness into his marvellous light; they knew it, and could not resist the impulse at once to tell those with whom they sat in the pews, that  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_37_1891/a_poor_mans_cry_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 37: 1891</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xxxiii_the_hardening_in_the.htm">The Hardening in the Sacred Scripture. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"He hath hardened their heart."-- John xii. 40. The Scripture teaches positively that the hardening and "darkening of their foolish heart" is a divine, intentional act. This is plainly evident from God's charge to Moses concerning the king of Egypt: "Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not harken unto you, and I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xxxiii_the_hardening_in_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/exposition_of_chap_iii_ii.htm">Exposition of Chap.

The communication of the Spirit of God was the constant prerogative of the Covenant-people. Indeed, the very idea of such a people necessarily requires it. For the Spirit of God is the only inward bond betwixt Him and that which is created; a Covenant-people, therefore, without such an inward  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/exposition_of_chap_iii_ii.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/exodus.htm">Exodus</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The book of Exodus--so named in the Greek version from the march of Israel out of Egypt--opens upon a scene of oppression very different from the prosperity and triumph in which Genesis had closed. Israel is being cruelly crushed by the new dynasty which has arisen in Egypt (i.) and the story of the book is the story of her redemption. Ultimately it is Israel's God that is her redeemer, but He operates largely by human means; and the first step is the preparation of a deliverer, Moses, whose parentage,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/exodus.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/egypt.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/red_sea.htm">Red Sea</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/didn't.htm">Didn't</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hardened.htm">Hardened</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heart.htm">Heart</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pharaoh's.htm">Pharaoh's</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sons.htm">Sons</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/strengtheneth.htm">Strengtheneth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stubborn.htm">Stubborn</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">God threatens to send locusts</a></span><br><span class="reftext">7. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Pharaoh, moved by his servants, inclines to let the Israelites go</a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-12.htm">The plague of the locusts</a></span><br><span class="reftext">16. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-16.htm">Pharaoh entreats Moses</a></span><br><span class="reftext">21. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">The plague of darkness</a></span><br><span class="reftext">24. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-24.htm">Pharaoh again entreats Moses, but yet is hardened</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-20.htm">Exodus 10:20</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/6178.htm"><b>6178</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardness of heart</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/6663.htm"><b>6663</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freedom, <i>of will</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13-23</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1416.htm"><b>1416</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miracles, <i>nature of</i></a></body></html>
