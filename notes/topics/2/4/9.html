"Thou Shalt be to Him Instead of God" (Ex. Iv. 16). </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"Thou shalt be to him instead of God" (Ex. iv. 16). Such was God's promise to Moses, and such the high character that Moses was to assume toward Aaron, his brother. May it not suggest a high and glorious place that each of us may occupy toward all whom we meet, instead of God? What a dignity and glory it would give our lives, could we uniformly realize this high calling! How it would lead us to act toward our fellow-men! God can always be depended upon. God is without variableness or shadow of turning.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/january_13_thou_shalt_be.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.

We know that "but." God has heard it from our lips a thousand times. It is the response of unbelief to the divine call. It is the reply of fear to the divine command. It is the suggestion that the resources are inadequate. It is a hint that God may not have looked all round. He has overlooked something which our own eyes have seen. The human "buts" in the Scriptural stories make an appalling record.
