Very clearly that was the case in Moses' naming of his two sons, who seem to have been the whole of his family. The significance of each name is appended to it in the text. The explanation of the first is, 'For he said, I have been an alien in a strange land'; and that  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_k/gershom_and_eliezer.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_making_of_a_nation/study_ix_the_origin_and.htm">The Origin and Growth of Law. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">MOSES' WORK AS JUDGE AND PROPHET.--Ex. 18; 1-27; 33:5-11.

We begin with citing some passages from the Old Testament in which occurs the preposition "B" which, in Gen. i. 27, stands before image, where  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/viii_after_the_scripture.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/appendix_xii_the_baptism_of.htm">Appendix xii.
