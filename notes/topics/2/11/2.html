The Egyptians are the pictures of those who are dead in trespasses and sins, enemies to God by wicked works, and aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. The Israelites, God's ancient people, are set before us as the representatives of those who have through grace believed in Christ, who fear God and who seek to keep his  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_6_1860/separating_the_precious_from_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 6: 1860</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/appendix_2_extracts_from_the.htm">Appendix 2 Extracts from the Babylon Talmud</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Massecheth Berachoth, or Tractate on Benedictions [76] Mishnah--From what time is the "Shema" said in the evening?

Israel is being cruelly crushed by the new dynasty which has arisen in Egypt (i.) and the story of the book is the story of her redemption. Ultimately it is Israel's God that is her redeemer, but He operates largely by human means; and the first step is the preparation of a deliverer, Moses, whose parentage,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/exodus.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/egypt.htm">Egypt</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/alike.htm">Alike</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/articles.htm">Articles</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/borrow.htm">Borrow</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ears.htm">Ears</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gold.htm">Gold</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hearing.htm">Hearing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jewelry.htm">Jewelry</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jewels.htm">Jewels</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/neighbour.htm">Neighbour</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/orders.htm">Orders</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/ornaments.htm">Ornaments</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/silver.htm">Silver</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/speak.htm">Speak</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/utensils.htm">Utensils</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vessels.htm">Vessels</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">God's message to the Israelites to borrow jewels of their neighbors</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Moses threatens Pharaoh with the death the firstborn</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4333.htm"><b>4333</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gold</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2-3</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5233.htm"><b>5233</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borrowing</a></body></html>
