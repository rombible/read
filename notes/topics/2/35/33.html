This is the beginning of the catalogue of contributions towards the erection of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. It emphasises the purely spontaneous and voluntary character of the gifts. There was plenty of compulsory work, of statutory contribution, in the Old Testament system of worship.

The Mishnic tractate Sabbath stands at the head of twelve tractates which together from the second of the six sections into which the Mishnah is divided, and which  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/appendix_xvii_the_ordinances_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/viii_gifts_and_talents.htm">Gifts and Talents. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him."--Judges iii. 10. We now consider the Holy Spirit's work in bestowing gifts, talents, and abilities upon artisans and professional men. Scripture declares that the special animation and qualification of persons for work assigned to them by God proceed from the Holy Spirit. The construction of the tabernacle required capable workmen, skilful carpenters, goldsmiths, and silversmiths, and masters in the arts of weaving and embroidering.

Taking the news to their Divisional Commander, they were instructed to Headquarters. It was found that the illness was due to shock.

Israel is being cruelly crushed by the new dynasty which has arisen in Egypt (i.) and the story of the book is the story of her redemption. Ultimately it is Israel's God that is her redeemer, but He operates largely by human means; and the first step is the preparation of a deliverer, Moses, whose parentage,  <a
