They have to spread their sails to the breeze of the age, and to pick up a gospel that comes floating down to them on the stream of time, altering every week in the year; and they must have an endless task to catch this new idea, or, as they put it, to keep abreast of the age.

Chs. 1-19 Israel in Egypt. The length of time the Hebrews remained In Egypt is a perplexing question. Exodus 6:16-20 makes Moses the fourth generation from Levi (See Gen. 15:16; Num. 26:57-59). This would make it about 150 years. Gen. 15:13 predicts 400 years. Ex. 12:40 says they were there 430 years and Paul (Gal. 3:17) says 430 years from Abraham to Sinai. These apparently conflicting dates may be explained because of different methods of counting generations, probably based on long lives of  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/tidwell/the_bible_period_by_period/chapter_v_from_egypt_to.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Josiah Blake Tidwell&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Bible Period by Period</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/murray/holy_in_christ/fourth_day_holiness_and_revelation.htm">Fourth Day.

And Moses hid his face, for He was afraid to look upon God.'--Ex. iii. 4-6.  And why was it holy ground? Because God had come there and occupied it.

Opinions differ as to the descent and birthplace of Elijah. According to some, he was from the land of Gilead (Bemid.

Ultimately it is Israel's God that is her redeemer, but He operates largely by human means; and the first step is the preparation of a deliverer, Moses, whose parentage,  <a
