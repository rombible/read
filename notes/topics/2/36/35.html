The Ordinances and Law of the Sabbath as Laid Down in the Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The terribly exaggerated views of the Rabbis, and their endless, burdensome rules about the Sabbath may best be learned from a brief analysis of the Mishnah, as further explained and enlarged in the Jerusalem Talmud. [6476] For this purpose a brief analysis of what is, confessedly, one of the most difficult tractates may here be given. The Mishnic tractate Sabbath stands at the head of twelve tractates which together from the second of the six sections into which the Mishnah is divided, and which  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/appendix_xvii_the_ordinances_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/doddridge/practical_discourses_on_regeneration/discourse_vii_of_the_necessity.htm">Of the Necessity of Divine Influences to Produce Regeneration in the Soul. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Titus iii. 5, 6.
