"When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you  from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the  Father, he shall testify of me." Some writers, especially when they are writing hymns, have fallen now-a- days into a habit of writing of the Holy Spirit of God, in a tone of  which I dare not say that it is wrong or untrue; but of which I must say,  that it is one-sided.

Christian life may mean nothing more than an earnest and honest attempt to follow and imitate Christ. Christ life is more than these, and expresses our actual union with the Lord Jesus Christ, and He is undoubtedly in us as the life and source of all our experience and work.

How can I take Christ as my Sanctifier, or Healer? is a question that we are constantly asked. It is necessary first of all that we get into the posture of faith. This has to be done by a definite and voluntary act, and then maintained by a uniform habit. It is just the same as the planting of a tree. You must put it in the soil by a definite act, and then you must let it stay put and remain settled in the ground until the little roots have time  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/february_25_i_am_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.

This thought was lately suggested by the remarks of a Christian friend, who told how God had laid it upon her heart to do something for His cause which was beyond her power, and when she dared to obey Him, He gave her the assurance of His power and resources, and so marvelously met her faith that she was enabled to do more than she  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/november_28_without_me_ye.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.

The sun is glorified when he has a chance to show his light through the crystal window, or reflect it from the spotless mirror or the glassy sea.
