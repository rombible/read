St John xvi. 16.  "A little while, and ye shall not see me:  and again, a  little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father." Divines differ, and, perhaps, have always differed, about the meaning of  these words.  Some think that our Lord speaks in them of His death and  resurrection.  Others that He speaks of His ascension and coming again in  glory.  I cannot decide which is right.  I dare not decide.
