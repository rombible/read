He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he  that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal." This is our Lord's own parable.

Death and resurrection are the central ideas of nature and Christianity.

The Eastern sages at His cradle, and these representatives of Western culture within a few hours of the Cross, were alike prophets.
