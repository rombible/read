By a thorough argumentation, Caspari has proved, that he occupies his right position in the Canon, and hence belongs to the earliest age of written prophecy, i.e., to the time of Jeroboam II. and Uzziah. As bearing conclusively against those who would assign to him a far later date, viz., the time of the exile, there is not only the indirect testimony borne by the place which this prophecy occupies in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophecy_of_obadiah.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newcomb/a_practical_directory_for_young_christian_females/letter_ix_meditation.htm">Letter ix.

MY DEAR SISTER: The subject of this letter is intimately connected with that of the last; and in proportion to your faithfulness in the duty now under consideration, will be your interest in the word and worship of God. Religious meditation is a serious, devout and practical thinking of divine things; a duty enjoined in Scripture, both by precept and example; and concerning which, let us observe, 1. Its importance.

By the Jewish arrangement, which places together the twelve minor prophets in a single volume, the chronological order of the prophets as a whole is broken up. The three greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, stand in the true order of time. Daniel began to prophesy before Ezekiel, but continued, many years after him. The Jewish arrangement of the twelve minor prophets is in a sense chronological; that is, they put the earlier prophets at the beginning, and the later at the end of the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/barrows/companion_to_the_bible/chapter_xxiii_the_twelve_minor.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">E.

The scriptural idea of prophecy is widely removed from that of human foresight and presentiment. It is that of a revelation made by the Holy Spirit respecting the future, always in the interest of God's kingdom. It is no part of the plan of prophecy to gratify vain curiosity respecting "the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power." Acts 1:7. "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God"--this is its key-note. In its form it is carefully adapted to this great end.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/barrows/companion_to_the_bible/chapter_xxxviii_interpretation_of_prophecy.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">E.

It will not be necessary to extend our preliminary remarks on the prophet Amos, since on the main point--viz., the circumstances under which he appeared as a prophet--the introduction to the prophecies of Hosea may be regarded as having been written for those of Amos also. For, according to the inscription, they belong to the same period at which Hosea's prophetic ministry began, viz., the latter part of the reign of Jeroboam II., and after Uzziah had ascended the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophet_amos.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_vii/sermon_xii_the_gospel_feast.htm">The Gospel Feast</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"When Jesus then lifted up His eyes, and saw a great company come unto Him, He saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?"--John vi. 5.  After these words the Evangelist adds, "And this He said to prove him, for He Himself knew what He would do."  Thus, you see, our Lord had secret meanings when He spoke, and did not bring forth openly all His divine sense at once.  He knew what He was about to do from the first, but He wished to lead forward His disciples, and to arrest and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_vii/sermon_xii_the_gospel_feast.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Henry Newman&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Parochial and Plain Sermons, Vol. VII</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/calvin/the_institutes_of_the_christian_religion/chapter_6_redemption_for_man.htm">Redemption for Man Lost to be Sought in Christ. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1.

Gen 17:7. His almightiness lies in this, that he can do whatever is feasible. Divines distinguish between authority and power.
