The external evidences of revealed religion are, in their proper place and sphere, of the highest importance. Christianity rests not upon theory, but upon historical facts sustained by an overwhelming mass of testimony. It is desirable that every Christian, so far as he has opportunity, should make himself acquainted with this testimony for the strengthening of his own faith and the refutation of gainsayers. Nevertheless, many thousands of Christians are fully established in the faith of the gospel  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/barrows/companion_to_the_bible/chapter_xii_evidences_internal_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">E.
