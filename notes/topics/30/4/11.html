November 15, 1874. Amos iv. 12.  "Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel." We read to-day, for the first lesson, parts of the prophecy of Amos.   They are somewhat difficult, here and there, to understand; but  nevertheless Amos is perhaps the grandest of the Hebrew prophets, next to  Isaiah.  Rough and homely as his words are, there is a strength, a  majesty, and a terrible earnestness in them, which it is good to listen  to; and specially good now that Advent draws near, and we have  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/all_saints_day_and_other_sermons/sermon_ii_preparation_for_advent.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">All Saints' Day and Other Sermons</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/anonymous/daily_light_on_the_daily_path/april_3_evening.htm">April 3 Evening</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning.--AMOS 4:11.

It seems that no preparation or disposition for grace is required on the part of man. For the apostle says (Rom. 4:4): "Now to him that worketh [40] is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt." But a man could not of his own free will prepare himself for grace, unless by an operation. The meaning of grace would then be taken away. 2.

For if the Father begets the Son from something, this will be either from Himself or from something else. If from something else, since that whence a thing is generated exists in what is generated, it follows that something different from the Father exists in the Son, and this contradicts what is laid down by Hilary (De Trin. vii) that, "In them nothing diverse or different exists." If the Father begets the Son from Himself,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_notional_acts_proceed.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_by_penance_one_sin.htm">Whether by Penance one Sin Can be Pardoned Without Another?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that by Penance one sin can be pardoned without another. For it is written (Amos 4:7): "I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon: and the piece whereupon I rained not, withered." These words are expounded by Gregory, who says (Hom. x super Ezech.): "When a man who hates his neighbor, breaks himself of other vices, rain falls on one part of the city, leaving the other part withered, for there are some men who,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_by_penance_one_sin.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_any_preparation_and_disposition.htm">Whether any Preparation and Disposition for Grace is Required on Man's Part?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that no preparation or disposition for grace is required on man's part, since, as the Apostle says (Rom. 4:4), "To him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt." Now a man's preparation by free-will can only be through some operation. Hence it would do away with the notion of grace. Objection 2: Further, whoever is going on sinning, is not preparing himself to have grace. But to some who are going on sinning grace is given, as is  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_any_preparation_and_disposition.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/pink/the_sovereignty_of_god/chapter_three_sovereignty_of_god.htm">Sovereignty of God in Administration</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"The LORD hath prepared His Throne In the heavens; and His Kingdom ruleth over all" (Psa. 103:19).
