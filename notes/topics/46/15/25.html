"As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also  bear the image of the heavenly." This season of Easter is the most joyful of all the year.  It is the most  comfortable time, in the true old sense of that word; for it is the  season which ought to comfort us most--that is, it gives us strength;  strength to live like men, and strength to die like men, when our time  comes.

XV. 3. Nothing is more characteristic of Christianity than its estimate of human sin.  Historically, no doubt, this is due to the fact that the Lord and Master of Christians died "on account of sins."  His death was due, as we have seen, both to the actual, definite sins of His contemporaries, and also to the irreconcilable opposition between His sinless life and the universal presence of sin in the world into which He came.
