Prepared by the Father in Creation. 2. Made possible by the Son in Redemption. 3. Effectually accomplished by the Holy Spirit in Sanctification. There is in this respect, first a work of the Father, which the Heidelberg Catechism designates, "Of God the Father  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xix_the_manifestation_of_holy.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/iv_the_work_of_the.htm">The Work of the Holy Spirit Distinguished. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."--Gen. i. 2.
