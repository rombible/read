Differently to be admonished are the slothful and the hasty.  For the former are to be persuaded not to lose, by putting it off, the good they have to do; but the latter are to be admonished lest, while they forestall the time of good deeds by inconsiderate haste, they change their meritorious character.  To the slothful therefore it is to be intimated, that often, when we will not do at the right time what we can, before long, when we will, we cannot.
