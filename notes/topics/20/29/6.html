It is not altogether an easy matter to secure a text for such an occasion as this; not because the texts are so few in number but rather because they are so many, for one has only to turn over the pages of the Bible in the most casual way to find them facing him at every reading.

We have two ancient proverbs here; each of them is true as a separate proverb, and they are equally true when linked together.
