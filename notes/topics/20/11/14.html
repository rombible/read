May 1872. Proverbs xi. 31.  "Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the  earth:  much more the wicked and the sinner." This is the key-note of the Book of Proverbs--that men are punished or  rewarded according to their deeds in this life; nay, it is the key-note  of the whole Old Testament.

We must not isolate our own interests, but feel that we live for others.
