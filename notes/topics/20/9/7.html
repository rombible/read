PROVERBS ix. 1-5. Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: she hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.  She hath sent forth her maidens; she crieth upon the highest places of the city, Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:  and to him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

As regards the matters about which you were so good as to consult so humble a person as myself, I had at first determined not to reply. Not because I had any doubt what to say, but because it seemed to me unnecessary or even presumptuous to give counsel to a man of sense and wisdom. But considering that it usually happens that the greater number of persons of sense--or  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bernard/some_letters_of_saint_bernard_abbot_of_clairvaux/letter_xxi_circa_a_d_1128.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Bernard of Clairvaux&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Some Letters of Saint Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/guyon/a_short_and_easy_method_of_prayer/chapter_xxiii_to_pastors_and.htm">To Pastors and Teachers</a><br></span><span class="snippet">To Pastors and Teachers If all who laboured for the conversion of others were to introduce them immediately into Prayer and the Interior Life, and make it their main design to gain and win over the heart, numberless as well as permanent conversions would certainly ensue.
