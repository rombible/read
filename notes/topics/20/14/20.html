There are very many passages of Scripture which ought to be read in connection with this text; as for example, "Fools make a mock at sin" (Proverbs 14:9), for only a fool would.  Better trifle with the pestilence and expose one's self to the plague than to discount the blighting effects of sin.  And, again, "The soul that sinneth it shall die" (Ezekiel 18:4).

'These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be fulfilled.'--JOHN xv. 11 (R.V.).  A poet, who used to be more fashionable than he is now, pronounces 'happiness' to be our being's end and aim. That is not true, except under great limitations and with many explanations.
