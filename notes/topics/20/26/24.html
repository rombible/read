H. Spurgeon. "The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets."--Proverbs 22:13. "The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets."--Proverbs 26:13. This slothful man seems to cherish that one dread of his about the lions, as if it were his favorite aversion and he felt it to be too much trouble to invent another excuse.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/sermons_on_proverbs/one_lion_two_lions_no.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">C.H.

From their lips and pens have come practically all the writings of the Old Testament. Of these three classes the wise men or sages are far less prominent or well known. They wrote no history of Israel, they preached no public sermons, nor do they appear  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kent/the_origin_and_permanent_value_of_the_old_testament/x_the_hebrew_sages_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Foster Kent&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Origin & Permanent Value of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/chapter_iv_we_shall_not.htm">We Shall not be Curious in the Ranking of the Duties in which Christian Love...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">We shall not be curious in the ranking of the duties in which Christian love should exercise itself. All the commandments of the second table are but branches of it: they might be reduced all to the works of righteousness and of mercy. But truly these are interwoven through other. Though mercy uses to be restricted to the showing of compassion upon men in misery, yet there is a righteousness in that mercy, and there is mercy in the most part of the acts of righteousness, as in not judging rashly,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/chapter_iv_we_shall_not.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Hugh Binning&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of the Rev.

The first nine chapters constitute a continuous discourse, almost in the manner of a sermon; and of the last two chapters, ch. xxx. is largely made up of enigmas, and xxxi. is in part a description of the good housewife. All, however, are rightly subsumed under the idea of wisdom, which to the Hebrew had always moral relations.
