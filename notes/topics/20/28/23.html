"Thou Hast covered all their sins."--Psalm 85:2. In these two texts we have man's covering, which is worthless and culpable, and God's covering, which is profitable and worthy of all acceptation.

Then how can he be happy who hath fear, and especially he who hath it always. Did not John also say that "perfect love casteth out fear?"
