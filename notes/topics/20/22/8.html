Proverbs xxii. 6. "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."  INTRODUCTION.--There is a district, high up in the Black Forest, where the ground is full of springs.  It is a plain some nine hundred feet above the sea.  Thousands upon thousands of little springs gush out of the soil; you seem to be on the rose of a vast watering-can.  Now, from this great source flow a good many rivers, and they flow in very different, nay, opposite directions.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/baring-gould/the_village_pulpit_volume_ii_trinity_to_advent/lxiv_the_formation_of_habits.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">S.
