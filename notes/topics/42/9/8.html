First and foremost Christ teaches resurrection and life. The power of Christianity is life. It brings us not merely law, duty, example, with high and holy teaching and admonition. It brings us the power to follow the higher ideal and the life that spontaneously does the things commanded. But it is not only life, but resurrection life. And it begins with a real crisis, a definite transaction, a point of time as clear as the morning dawn.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/may_11_whosoever_will_save.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
