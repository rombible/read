NINTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY. Luke xvi. 8.  "And the Lord commended the unjust steward, because he had  done wisely." None of our Lord's parables has been as difficult to explain as this one.   Learned and pious men have confessed freely, in all ages, that there is  much in the parable which they cannot understand; and I am bound to  confess the same.  The puzzle is, plainly, why our Lord should SEEM to  bid us to copy the conduct of a bad man and a cheat.  For this is the  usual interpretation.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/all_saints_day_and_other_sermons/sermon_xlii_the_unjust_steward.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">All Saints' Day and Other Sermons</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/anonymous/daily_light_on_the_daily_path/september_8_morning.htm">September 8 Morning</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.--DAN. 5:27.

The one is stigmatised as 'that which is least,' the unrighteous mammon,' 'that which is another's'; whilst the higher is magnified as being 'that which is most,' 'the true riches,' 'your own.'

It is a very striking thought that Christ, if He be what we suppose Him to be, knew all about the unseen present which we call the future, and yet was all but silent in reference to it.
