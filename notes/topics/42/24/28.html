St. Luke xxiv. 5, 6.  "Why seek ye the living among the dead?  He is not  here, but is risen." This is a very solemn day; for on this day the Lord Jesus Christ was  crucified.  The question for us is, how ought we to keep it? that is,  what sort of thoughts ought to be in our minds upon this day?  Now, many  most excellent and pious persons, and most pious books, seem to think  that we ought to-day to think as much as possible of the sufferings of  our Blessed Lord; and because we  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/all_saints_day_and_other_sermons/sermon_ix_good_friday.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">All Saints' Day and Other Sermons</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/anonymous/daily_light_on_the_daily_path/february_11_morning.htm">February 11 Morning</a><br></span><span class="snippet">They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord harkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.--MAL. 3:16.

In His last messages to the disciples in the 14th and 15th chapters of John, the Lord Jesus clearly teaches us that the very essence of the highest holiness is, "Abide in Me, and I in you, for without Me ye can do nothing."
