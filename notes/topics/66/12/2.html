THE last lecture referred principally to the confession of sin. To-night my remarks will be chiefly confined to the subject of intercession, or prayer. There are two kinds of means requisite to promote a revival; one to influence men, the other to influence God. The truth is employed to influence men, and prayer to move God. When I speak of moving God, I do not mean that God's mind is changed by prayer, or that his  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/finney/lectures_on_revivals_of_religion/lecture_iv_prevailing_prayer.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Grandison Finney&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Lectures on Revivals of Religion</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bullinger/commentary_on_revelation/the_third.htm">The Third</a><br></span><span class="snippet">refers to Exodus.
