It is one of the leading characteristics of this present age, the closed, the silent heavens. But they will not be silent forever. "Our God shall come and shall not keep silence" (Ps. i:3). In His divine Patience the Lord has been at the right hand of God for nearly two thousand years. He will not occupy that place forever. It is not His permanent station to be upon the Father's throne. He has the promise of His own throne, which He as the King-Priest must occupy.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/gaebelein/the_lord_of_glory/he_shall_not_keep_silent.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Arno Gaebelein&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Lord of Glory</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bernard/some_letters_of_saint_bernard_abbot_of_clairvaux/letter_xxxvii_circa_a_d_1131.htm">Letter xxxvii (Circa A.
