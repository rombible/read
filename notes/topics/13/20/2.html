These words were at first addressed to the Church of God. The prophet Isaiah begins his prophecy, by calling upon the heavens and the earth to witness the exceeding sinfulness of God's chosen people. "Hear, O heavens, and give ear O earth: for the Lord hath spoken; I have nourished and brought up children,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/shedd/sermons_to_the_natural_man/self-scrutiny_in_gods_presence.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">William G.T.
