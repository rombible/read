Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. 3. And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/altar_and_temple.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maspero/history_of_egypt_chaldaea_syria_babylonia_and_assyria_v_9/chapter_ithe_iranian_conquest.htm">The Iranian Conquest</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Drawn by Boudier, from the engraving in Coste and Flandin.
