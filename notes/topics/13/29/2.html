This is a fragment from the chronicler's close of his life of King David. He is referring in it to other written authorities in which there are fuller particulars concerning his hero; and he says, 'the acts of David the King, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Samuel the seer ... with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over all Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.'

W. J. TOWNSEND, D.D.  Enoch was the bright particular star of the patriarchal epoch.  His record is short, but eloquent.  It is crowded into a few words, but every word, when placed under examination, expands indefinitely.  Every virtue may be read into them; every eulogium possible to a human character shines from them.  He was a devout man, a fearless preacher of righteousness, an intimate friend of God, and the only man of his dispensation who did not see death.
