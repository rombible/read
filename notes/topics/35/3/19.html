The secret of joy is not to wait until you feel happy, but to rise, by an act of faith, out of the depression which is dragging you down, and begin to praise God as an act of choice. This is the meaning of such passages as these: "Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I say, rejoice"; "I do rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice." "Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations." In all these cases there is an evident struggle with sadness and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/september_7_i_will_joy.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
