The tender annual which blossoms for a season and dies, and the Columbian aloe, which develops in a century, each is true to its normal principle.

Inward silence is absolutely indispensable, because the Word is essential and eternal, and necessarily requires dispositions in the soul in some degree correspondent to His nature, as a capacity for the reception of Himself. Hearing is a sense formed to receive sounds, and is rather passive than active, admitting, but not communicating sensation; and if we would hear, we must lend the ear  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/guyon/a_short_and_easy_method_of_prayer/chapter_xiv_of_inward_silence.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Madame Guyon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Short and Easy Method of Prayer</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bouvieres/a_short_method_of_prayer_and_spiritual_torrents/chapter_xi_of_rest_in.htm">Of Rest in the Presence of God --Its Fruits --Inward Silence --God Commands it --Outward Silence. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The soul, being brought to this place, needs no other preparation than that of repose: for the presence of God during the day, which is the great result of prayer, or rather prayer itself, begins to be intuitive and almost continual.
