Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. 20. And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.

To maintain a modern and wholly uncatholic system of Penitence, the schoolmen invented a technical scheme of sins mortal and sins venial, which must not be read into the Fathers, who had no such technicalities in mind. By "deadly sins" they meant all such as St. John recognizes (1 John v. 16-17) and none other; that is to say sins of surprise and infirmity, sins having in them no malice or wilful disobedience, such as an impatient word, or a momentary neglect of  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/tertullian/the_five_books_against_marcion/elucidations.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Tertullian&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Five Books Against Marcion</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/calvin/the_institutes_of_the_christian_religion/chapter_18_the_instrumentality_of.htm">The Instrumentality of the Wicked Employed by God, While He Continues Free from Every Taint. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1.
