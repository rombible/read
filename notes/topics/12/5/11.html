Naaman, the great Syrian noble, is stricken with the disease that throughout the Old Testament is treated as a parable of sin and death.

MUNGER [From "Lamps and Paths," by courtesy of Houghton, Mifflin & Co.] In old days we read of angels who came and took men by the hand, and led them away from the city of Destruction.

Elisha and Gehazi were master and man.  They were more.  They were almost father and son.  Elisha calls him "my heart," just as Paul calls Onesimus his heart.  Yet they parted so.--"He went out from his presence a leper."  The punishment was terrible.  Was it deserved?

For it is written (Is. 53:8): "Who shall declare His generation?" Therefore Christ's genealogy should not have been set down. Objection 2: Further, one man cannot possibly have two fathers. But Matthew says that "Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary": whereas Luke says that Joseph was the son of Heli. Therefore they contradict one another.

For Christ was baptized in order that He might lead others to baptism by His example. But it is commendable that the faithful of Christ should be baptized, not merely before their thirtieth year, but even in infancy. Therefore it seems that Christ should not have been baptized at the age of thirty. Objection 2: Further, we do not read that Christ taught or worked miracles before being baptized.

It covers a period of no less than four centuries.
