But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. 3. And he was with her hid in the house of the Lord six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land. 4. And the seventh year Jehoiada  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/jehoiada_and_joash.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_17_1871/new_uses_for_old_trophies.htm">New Uses for Old Trophies</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The matter I shall speak to you about to-night will lie under four heads. We will give them to you as they occur to us. I. And the first is this, IT IS WELL FOR US TO HANG ALL OUR TROPHIES IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. We, too, are warriors. Every genuine Christian has to fight. Every inch of the way between here and heaven we shall have to fight, for as hitherto every single step of our pilgrimage has been one prolonged conflict. Sometimes we have victories, a presage of that final victory, that perfect  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_17_1871/new_uses_for_old_trophies.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 17: 1871</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_iii_of_the_weight.htm">Of the Weight of Government; and that all Manner of Adversity is to be Despised, and Prosperity Feared. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">So much, then, have we briefly said, to shew how great is the weight of government, lest whosoever is unequal to sacred offices of government should dare to profane them, and through lust of pre-eminence undertake a leadership of perdition.  For hence it is that James affectionately deters us, saying, Be not made many masters, my brethren (James iii. 1).  Hence the Mediator between God and man Himself--He who, transcending the knowledge and understanding even of supernal spirits, reigns in heaven  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_iii_of_the_weight.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Leo the Great&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Writings of Leo the Great</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_9_mothers_daughters_and.htm">Mothers, Daughters, and Wives in Israel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">In order accurately to understand the position of woman in Israel, it is only necessary carefully to peruse the New Testament. The picture of social life there presented gives a full view of the place which she held in private and in public life. Here we do not find that separation, so common among Orientals at all times, but a woman mingles freely with others both at home and abroad. So far from suffering under social inferiority, she takes influential and often leading part in all movements, specially  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_9_mothers_daughters_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sketches of Jewish Social Life</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/kings.htm">Kings</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The book[1] of Kings is strikingly unlike any modern historical narrative. Its comparative brevity, its curious perspective, and-with some brilliant exceptions--its relative monotony, are obvious to the most cursory perusal, and to understand these things is, in large measure, to understand the book. It covers a period of no less than four centuries. Beginning with the death of David and the accession of Solomon (1 Kings i., ii.) it traverses his reign with considerable fulness (1 Kings iii.-xi.),  <a
