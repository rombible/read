And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.'--2 KINGS iv. 6.  The series of miracles ascribed to Elisha are very unlike most of the wonderful works of even the Old Testament, and still more unlike those of the New. For about a great many of them there seems to have been no special purpose, either doctrinal or otherwise, but simply the relief of trivial and transient distresses.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/when_the_oil_flows.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/a_miracle_needing_effort.htm">A Miracle Needing Effort</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.

Thus he is connected with two worlds. The physical creation is termed the "outward man," and the spiritual, the "inward man."

Bethlehem was not the stated residence of Joseph and Mary, either before or after the birth of the child (Luke i. 26, ii. 4, 39; Matt. ii. 2).
