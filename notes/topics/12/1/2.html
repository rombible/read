Because the sin which has some excuse cannot be most grievous. But our Lord Himself excused the sin of His crucifiers when He said: "Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do" (Lk. 23:34). Therefore theirs was not the most grievous sin. Objection 2: Further, our Lord said to Pilate (Jn. 19:11): "He that hath delivered Me to thee hath the greater sin." But it was Pilate who caused Christ to be crucified  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_sin_of_those.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_it_is_lawful_to_14.htm">Whether it is Lawful to Curse an Irrational Creature?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that it is unlawful to curse an irrational creature. Cursing would seem to be lawful chiefly in its relation to punishment. Now irrational creatures are not competent subjects either of guilt or of punishment. Therefore it is unlawful to curse them. Objection 2: Further, in an irrational creature there is nothing but the nature which God made. But it is unlawful to curse this even in the devil, as stated above [2960](A[1]).

The argument of the letter is, that the story of Lazarus's being raised is an imposture; or else the Jews could not have been so wicked, as to be on that account provoked against  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lardner/a_vindication_of_three_of_our_blessed_saviours_miracles/answer_to_the_jewish_rabbys.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Nathaniel Lardner&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Vindication of Three of Our Blessed Saviour's Miracles</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/doddridge/the_rise_and_progress_of_religion_in_the_soul/chapter_xii_an_address_to.htm">An Address to a Soul So Overwhelmed with a Sense of the Greatness of Its Sins, that it Dares not Apply Itself to Christ with Any</a><br></span><span class="snippet">1-4.

Its comparative brevity, its curious perspective, and-with some brilliant exceptions--its relative monotony, are obvious to the most cursory perusal, and to understand these things is, in large measure, to understand the book. It covers a period of no less than four centuries.
