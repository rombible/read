The city of Samaria was closely besieged, and suffering all the horrors of famine. Women were boiling and eating their children, and the most revolting garbage was worth its weight in silver.

We hear not that any of the common people, the plebeians, ever did so; but an aristocrat did it. Strange it is, that God has seldom chosen the great men of this world. High places and faith in Christ do seldom well agree. This great man said, "Impossible!" and, with an insult to the prophet, he added, "If the Lord should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be."

It was the amiable character of our blessed Redeemer, that "he went about doing good," this great motive, which animated all his actions, brought him to the house of his friend Lazarus, at Bethany, and directed his behavior there. Though it was a season of recess from public labor, our Lord brought the sentiments and the pious cares of a preacher of righteousness into the parlor of a friend; and there his doctrine dropped as the rain, and distilled as the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/whitefield/selected_sermons_of_george_whitefield/the_care_of_the_soul.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">George Whitefield&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Selected Sermons of George Whitefield</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/doddridge/the_rise_and_progress_of_religion_in_the_soul/chapter_xii_an_address_to.htm">An Address to a Soul So Overwhelmed with a Sense of the Greatness of Its Sins, that it Dares not Apply Itself to Christ with Any</a><br></span><span class="snippet">1-4.

The history of the inquiries connected with this question is found most fully in Marckius's "Diatribe de uxore fornicationum," Leyden, 1696, reprinted in the Commentary on the Minor Prophets by the same author. The various views may be divided into three classes. 1.
