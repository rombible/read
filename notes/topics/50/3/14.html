One bright and thankful look at the cross is worth a thousand morbid, self-condemning reflections. The longer you look at evil the more it mesmerizes and defiles you into its own likeness. Lay it down at the cross, accept the cleansing blood, reckon yourself dead to the thing that was wrong, and then rise up and count yourself as if you were another man and no longer the same person; and then, identifying  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/september_6_finally_my_brethren.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
