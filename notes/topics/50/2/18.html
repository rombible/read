It is a blessed thing to have our life laid out and our Christian work adjusted to God's plan. Much strength is lost by working at a venture. Much spiritual force is expended in wasted effort, and scattered, indefinite and inconstant attempts at doing good.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/january_17_it_is_god.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
