Eversley.  Chester Cathedral, 1872. 1 John iv. 16, 21.  "God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth  in God, and God in him. . . .  And this commandment have we from Him,  That he who loveth God love his brother also." This is the first Sunday after Trinity.  On it the Church begins to teach  us morals,--that is, how to live a good life; and therefore she begins by  teaching us the foundation of all morals,--which is love,--love to God  and love to man.

This is the second of a pair of twin verses which deal with substantially the same subject under two slightly different aspects. The thought common to both is that Christ's mission is the great revelation of God's love. But in the preceding verse the point on which stress is laid is the manifestation of that love, and in our text the point mainly brought out is its  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/christs_mission_the_revelation_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_servant_as_his_lord.htm">The Servant as his Lord</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'...

John, in his gospel and epistles, deals with the deepest realities, and with all things in their eternal aspects, but his vocabulary is the simplest in the New Testament. God and the world, life and death, love and hate, light and darkness, these are the favourite words round which his thoughts gather.

It does not come from doing something; it comes from living with Somebody. "Abide in Me." That is how love is born, for "love is of God, and God is love."

There is in this respect, first a work of the Father, which the Heidelberg Catechism designates, "Of God the Father  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xix_the_manifestation_of_holy.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xviii_love_in_the_triune.htm">Love in the Triune Being of God. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"God is Love."--1 John iv. 8. Between natural love even in its highest forms and Holy Love there is a wide chasm. This had to be emphasized so that our readers might not mistake the nature of Love. Many say that God is Love, but measure His Love by the love of men. They study love's being and manifestations in others and in themselves, and then think themselves competent to judge that this human love, in a more perfect form, is the Love of God.
