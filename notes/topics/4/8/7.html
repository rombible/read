Our Lord ever seemed, in the eagerness of his love, to be anticipating his work. Before he was set apart for his life-work, by the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him, he must needs be about his Father's business; before he finally suffered at the hands of cruel men, he had a baptism to be baptized with, and he was straitened  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_32_1886/our_lords_prayer_for_his.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 32: 1886</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xxii_my_little_children.htm">"My Little Children, These Things Write I unto You, that Ye Sin Not.

To take away guilt, nothing so fit as blood for there is no punishment beyond blood, therefore  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xxii_my_little_children.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Hugh Binning&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of the Rev.

Beginning with a census of the men of war (i.) and the order of the camp (ii.), it devotes specific attention to the Levites, their numbers and duties (iii., iv.).
