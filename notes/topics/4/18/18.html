I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift.'--NUM. xviii. 7. All Christians are priests--to offer sacrifices, alms, especially prayers; to make God known to men. I. Our priesthood is a gift of God's love. We are apt to think of our duties as burdensome. They are an honour and a mark of God's grace. 1. They are His gift-- (a) The power to do.

For it is written (Is. 33:7): "The angels of peace shall weep bitterly." But weeping is a sign of grief and sorrow. Therefore angels grieve for the ills of those whom they guard. Objection 2: Further, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15), "sorrow is for those things that happen against our will." But the loss of the man whom he has guarded is against the guardian angel's will.
