For whoever usurps what is God's sins. But vengeance belongs to God, for it is written (Dt. 32:35, Rom. 12:19): "Revenge to Me, and I will repay." Therefore all vengeance is unlawful. Objection 2: Further, he that takes vengeance on a man does not bear with him. But we ought to bear with the wicked, for a gloss on Cant 2:2, "As the lily among the thorns," says: "He is not a good man that cannot bear with a wicked one." Therefore we should not take  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_vengeance_is_lawful.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/murray/the_two_covenants/chapter_xv_the_covenant_of.htm">The Covenant of an Everlasting Priesthood</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"That My covenant might be with Levi.

ISRAEL was meant by God to be a nation of priests. In the first making of the Covenant this was distinctly stipulated.

Differently to be admonished are those that are at variance and those that are at peace.  For those that are at variance are to be admonished to know most certainly that, in whatever virtues they may abound, they can by no means become spiritual if they neglect becoming united to their neighbours by concord.  For it is written, But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace (Gal. v. 22).  He then that has no care to keep peace refuses to bear the fruit of the Spirit.

Beginning with a census of the men of war (i.) and the order of the camp (ii.), it devotes specific attention to the Levites, their numbers and duties (iii., iv.).
