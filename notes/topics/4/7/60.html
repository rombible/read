INTRODUCTORY. For many years these chapters had no special interest to me; but I have never ceased to be thankful that I was early led to read the Word of GOD in regular course: it was through this habit that these chapters first became specially precious to me. I was travelling on a missionary tour in the province of CHEH-KIANG, and had to pass the night in a very wicked town. All the inns were dreadful places; and the people seemed to have their consciences seared, and their hearts  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/taylor/separation_and_service/separation_and_service.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">James Hudson Taylor&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Separation and Service</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_32_1886/our_lords_prayer_for_his.htm">Our Lord's Prayer for his People's Sanctification</a><br></span><span class="snippet">In this wonderful prayer, our Lord, as our great High Priest, appears to enter upon that perpetual office of intercession which he is now exercising at the right hand of the Father. Our Lord ever seemed, in the eagerness of his love, to be anticipating his work. Before he was set apart for his life-work, by the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him, he must needs be about his Father's business; before he finally suffered at the hands of cruel men, he had a baptism to be baptized with, and he was straitened  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_32_1886/our_lords_prayer_for_his.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 32: 1886</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/paley/evidences_of_christianity/chapter_i_prophecy.htm">Prophecy. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">PROPHECY.

Beginning with a census of the men of war (i.) and the order of the camp (ii.), it devotes specific attention to the Levites, their numbers and duties (iii., iv.).
