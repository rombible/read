Of it, in the eastern part, there is this mention: "From Rekam to the east, and Rekam is as the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_7_kadesh_rekam_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/epistle_sermons_vol_iii/ninth_sunday_after_trinity_carnal.htm">Ninth Sunday after Trinity Carnal Security and Its vices. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Text: 1 Corinthians 10, 6-13. 6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. 7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 9 Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents. 10 Neither murmur ye, as  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/epistle_sermons_vol_iii/ninth_sunday_after_trinity_carnal.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Martin Luther&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Epistle Sermons, Vol. III</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/epistle_sermons_vol_iii/twenty_third_sunday_after_trinity.htm">Twenty Third Sunday after Trinity Enemies of the Cross of Christ and the Christian's Citizenship in Heaven. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Text: Philippians 3, 17-21. 17 Brethren, be ye imitators [followers] together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample. 18 For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 19 whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things. 20 For our citizenship [conversation] is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 21 who  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/epistle_sermons_vol_iii/twenty_third_sunday_after_trinity.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Martin Luther&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Epistle Sermons, Vol. III</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_vii/sermon_ix_moses_the_type.htm">Moses the Type of Christ. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye shall hearken."--Deut. xviii. 15.
