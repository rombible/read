But it is now to be proved that what is promised to God by vow or oath, ought to be performed also because of the act of Covenanting. The performance of that exercise is commanded, and the same law which enjoins that the duties  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_v_covenanting_confers_obligation.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Cunningham&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ordinance of Covenanting</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xiv_and_the_redeemer.htm">"And the Redeemer Shall Come unto Zion, and unto them that Turn,"</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Isaiah lix. 20.--"And the Redeemer shall come unto Zion, and unto them that turn," &c.

It may be made between superiors and inferiors, or between equals. The sentiment that a covenant can be made only between parties respectively independent of one another is inconsistent with the testimony of Scripture. Parties to covenants in a great variety of relative circumstances, are there introduced.
