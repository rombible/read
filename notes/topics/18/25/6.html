For it is written (Job 25:2): "Who maketh peace in His high places." But strife is opposed to peace. Therefore among the high angels there is no strife. Objection 2: Further, where there is perfect charity and just authority there can be no strife. But all this exists among the angels. Therefore there is no strife among the angels. Objection 3: Further, if we say that angels strive for those whom they guard, one angel  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_there_can_be_strife.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_matter_of_christs.htm">Whether the Matter of Christ's Body Should have Been Taken from a Woman?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that the matter of Christ's body should not have been taken from a woman. For the male sex is more noble than the female. But it was most suitable that Christ should assume that which is perfect in human nature. Therefore it seems that He should not have taken flesh from a woman but rather from man: just as Eve was formed from the rib of a man. Objection 2: Further, whoever is conceived of a woman is shut up in her womb.

"Who shall boast that he hath a chaste heart? or who shall boast that he is clean from sin?" [2200] Holy virginity is indeed inviolate from the mother's womb; but "no one," saith he, "is clean in Thy sight, not even the infant whose life is of one day upon the earth." [2201] There is kept also in faith inviolate a certain virginal chastity, whereby the Church is joined as a chaste virgin unto One Husband: but That  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/of_holy_virginity_/section_48_what_now_shall.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Augustine&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Of Holy Virginity. </span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_sufficient_reason_can_be.htm">Whether Sufficient Reason Can be Assigned for the Ceremonies Pertaining to Holy Things?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that no sufficient reason can be assigned for the ceremonies of the Old Law that pertain to holy things. For Paul said (Acts 17:24): "God Who made the world and all things therein; He being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made by hands." It was therefore unfitting that in the Old Law a tabernacle or temple should be set up for the worship of God. Objection 2: Further, the state of the Old Law was not changed except by Christ. But the tabernacle denoted  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_sufficient_reason_can_be.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_all_the_angels_who.htm">Whether all the Angels who are Sent, Assist?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that the angels who are sent also assist. For Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): "So the angels are sent, and assist; for, though the angelic spirit is limited, yet the supreme Spirit, God, is not limited." Objection 2: Further, the angel was sent to administer to Tobias. Yet he said, "I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven who stand before the Lord" (Tob. 12:15). Therefore the angels who are sent, assist.
