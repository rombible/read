For it is said of the damned (Job 18:18), "And God shall remove him out of the globe [Douay: 'world']." Therefore the fire whereby the damned will be punished is not beneath the earth but outside the globe. Objection 2: Further, nothing violent or accidental can be everlasting. But this fire will be in hell for ever. Therefore it will be there, not by force but naturally. Now fire cannot be under the earth save by violence.

For it belongs to the head to diffuse sense and movement into the members, as a gloss says, on Eph. 1:22, "And made Him head," etc. But the devil has no power of spreading the evil of sin, which proceeds from the will of the sinner. Therefore the devil cannot be called the head of the wicked. Objection 2: Further, by every sin a man is made evil. But not every sin is from the devil; and this is plain as regards the demons, who  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_devil_is_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/calvin/the_institutes_of_the_christian_religion/chapter_11_the_difference_between.htm">The Difference Between the Two Testaments. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1. Five points of difference between the Old and the New Testaments. These belong to the mode of administration rather than the substance. First difference. In the Old Testament the heavenly inheritance is exhibited under temporal blessings; in the New, aids of this description are not employed. 2. Proof of this first difference from the simile of an heir in pupillarity, as in Gal. 4:1. 3. This the reason why the Patriarchs, under the Law, set a higher value on this life and the blessings of it,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/calvin/the_institutes_of_the_christian_religion/chapter_11_the_difference_between.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Calvin&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Institutes of the Christian Religion</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_fire_of_hell_2.htm">Whether the Fire of Hell is of the Same Species as Ours?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that this fire is not of the same species as the corporeal fire which we see. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 16): "In my opinion no man knows of what kind is the everlasting fire, unless the Spirit of God has revealed it to anyone." But all or nearly all know the nature of this fire of ours. Therefore that fire is not of the same species as this. Objection 2: Further, Gregory commenting on Job 10:26, "A fire that is not kindled shall devour him," says (Moral. xv):  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_fire_of_hell_2.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/the_desire_of_the_righteous.htm">The Desire of the Righteous Granted;</a><br></span><span class="snippet">OR, A DISCOURSE OF THE RIGHTEOUS MAN'S DESIRES.
