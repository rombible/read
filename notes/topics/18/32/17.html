"For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."  There are many differences among men in this world, that, as to outward appearance, are great and wide, and indeed they are so eagerly pursued, and seriously minded by men, as if they were great and momentous. You see what a strife and contention there is among men, how to be extracted out of the dregs of the multitude, and set a little higher  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_xviii_for_they_that.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Hugh Binning&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of the Rev.

For it is written (Ecclus. 48:14) that after death the body of Eliseus prophesied, and further on (Ecclus. 49:18) it is said of Joseph that "his bones were visited, and after death they prophesied." Now no knowledge remains in the body or in the bones after death. Therefore prophecy does not pertain to knowledge. Objection 2: Further, it is written (1 Cor. 14:3): "He that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification."
