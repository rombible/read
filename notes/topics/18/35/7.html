Surely, had they thought of God they could not have acted so unjustly.

ELIHU was a wise man, exceeding wise, though not as wise as the all-wise Jehovah, who sees light in the clouds, and finds order in confusion; hence Elihu, being much puzzled at beholding Job thus afflicted, cast about him to find the cause of it, and he very wisely hit upon one of the most likely reasons, although it did not happen to be the right one in Job's case.

Because man, by sinning, can do nothing against God; since it is written (Job 35:6): "If thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against Him?" And yet God is spoken of as being angry with man on account of sin, according to Ps. 105:40: "The Lord was exceedingly angry with His people." Therefore it is not always on account of something done against him, that a man is angry.

For no one, it would seem, merits by giving another his due. But by all the good we do, we cannot make sufficient return to God, since yet more is His due, as also the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 14). Hence it is written (Lk. 17:10): "When you have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do." Therefore a man can merit nothing from God.

For charity is chiefly directed to God. Now we cannot benefit God, according to Job 35:7: "What shalt thou give Him? or what shall He receive of thy hand?" Therefore beneficence is not an act of charity. Objection 2: Further, beneficence consists chiefly in making gifts. But this belongs to liberality. Therefore beneficence is an act of liberality and not of charity.

Because, as stated above [1202](A[3]), merit and demerit imply relation to retribution for good or harm done to another. But a man's action, good or evil, does no good or harm to God; for it is written (Job 35:6,7): "If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt Him? . . . And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give Him?"

Because the harm done is an issue consequent to the sinful act. But the issue of an act does not add to its goodness or malice, as stated above ([1736]Q[20], A[5]). Therefore a sin is not aggravated on account of its causing more harm. Objection 2: Further, harm is inflicted by sins against our neighbor. Because no one wishes to harm himself: and no one can harm God, according to Job 35:6, 8: "If thy iniquities  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_sin_is_aggravated_by.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lardner/an_essay_on_the_mosaic_account_of_the_creation_and_fall_of_man/essay.htm">An Essay on the Mosaic Account of the Creation and Fall of Man</a><br></span><span class="snippet">THERE are not a few difficulties in the account, which Moses has given of the creation of the world, and of the formation, and temptation, and fall of our first parents.

It seems that a man cannot merit anything from God. No one merits a reward by repaying what he owes to another. But we cannot even fully repay what we owe to God, by all the good that we do. For we always owe him more than this, as the philosopher says in 8 Ethics 14. Hence it is said in Luke 17:10: "when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/nature_and_grace/article_one_whether_a_man_2.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Nature and Grace</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_it_is_necessary_for_3.htm">Whether it is Necessary for the Salvation of All, that they Should Believe Explicitly in the Mystery of Christ?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that it is not necessary for the salvation of all that they should believe explicitly in the mystery of Christ. For man is not bound to believe explicitly what the angels are ignorant about: since the unfolding of faith is the result of Divine revelation, which reaches man by means of the angels, as stated above [2287](A[6]; [2288]FP, Q[111], A[1]). Now even the angels were in ignorance of the mystery of the Incarnation: hence, according to the commentary of Dionysius (Coel.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_it_is_necessary_for_3.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_iv_they_have_corrupted.htm">"They have Corrupted Themselves; their Spot is not the Spot of his Children; they are a Perverse and Crooked Generation.

We doubt this people would take well with such a description of themselves as Moses gives. It might seem strange to us, that God should have chosen such a people out of all the nations of the earth, and they to be so rebellious and perverse, if our own experience did not teach us how free his choice is, and how long-suffering he is, and constant in his choice.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_iv_they_have_corrupted.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Hugh Binning&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Works of the Rev.
