A complaint; its cause and cure; and then close up with an exhortation to stir up your pure minds, if you are in such a position. I. First, there is a COMPLAINT. How many a Christian looks on the past with pleasure, on the future with dread, and on the present with sorrow! There are many who look back upon the days that they have passed in the fear of the Lord as being the sweetest and the best they have ever had, but as to the present, it is clad in a sable garb of gloom  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_1_1855/comfort_for_the_desponding.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 1: 1855</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_17_1871/jobs_regret_and_our_own.htm">Job's Regret and Our Own</a><br></span><span class="snippet">I. Let us begin by saying, that regrets such as those expressed in the text are and ought to be very BITTER. If it be the loss of spiritual things that we regret, then may we say from the bottom of our hearts, "Oh that I were as in months past." It is a great thing for a man to be near to God; it is a very choice privilege to be admitted into the inner circle of communion, and to become God's familiar friend. Great as the privilege is, so great is the loss of it.
