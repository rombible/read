If the Lord does not in this world visit the ungodly with stripes, this is but the surer evidence that in the world to come there is a solemn retribution for the impenitent. If the affliction which is here accorded to men be not the punishment of sin, we turn to Scripture and discover what that punishment will be, and we are soon informed that it is something far heavier than any calamities  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_7_1861/not_now_but_hereafter.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 7: 1861</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/finney/lectures_on_revivals_of_religion/lecture_xvii_false_comforts_for.htm">False Comforts for Sinners. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">Text.--How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood.--Job xxi. 34.

Usually these movements are in measured step, and are accompanied by music. In some form or another dancing is as old as the world, and has been practiced by rude as well as by civilized peoples. The passion for amateur dancing always has been strongest among savage nations, who have made equal use of it in religious rites and in war.

Because some are said to be happy because they hope for a reward, as stated above [1672](A[1]). Now the object of hope is future happiness. Therefore these rewards refer to the life to come. Objection 2: Further, certain punishments are set down in opposition to the beatitudes, Lk. 6:25, where we read: "Woe to you that are filled; for you shall hunger.

For "the involuntary act deserves pardon," as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 24). But sometimes that which is done through ignorance does not deserve pardon, according to 1 Cor. 14:38: "If any man know not, he shall not be known." Therefore ignorance does not cause involuntariness. Objection 2: Further, every sin implies ignorance; according to Prov. 14: 22: "They err, that work evil."

Objection 2: Further, "All men have a natural desire for knowledge," as stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics i, 1. But knowledge is only of truth. Therefore truth is naturally desired and loved. But that which is in a thing naturally, is always in it. Therefore no man can hate the truth.

For it is written (Jn. 9:3, 2) about the man born blind: "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents . . . that he should be born blind." In like manner we see that many children, those also who have been baptized, suffer grievous punishments, fevers, for instance, diabolical possession, and so forth, and yet there is no sin in them after they have been baptized.
