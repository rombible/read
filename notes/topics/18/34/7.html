But it is now to be proved that what is promised to God by vow or oath, ought to be performed also because of the act of Covenanting. The performance of that exercise is commanded, and the same law which enjoins that the duties  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_v_covenanting_confers_obligation.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Cunningham&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ordinance of Covenanting</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/nature_and_grace/article_three_whether_god_provides.htm">Whether God Provides for all Things Directly</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Whether God Provides for All Things Directly We proceed to the third article thus: 1. It seems that God does not provide for all things directly. We must ascribe to God whatever dignity requires, and the dignity of a king requires that he provide for his subjects through the medium of ministers. Much more, then, does God provide for all things through some medium. 2. Again, providence ordains things to their end.

It seems that predestination is not certain. For on Rev. 3:11, "hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown," Augustine says: "no other will take it if one does not lose it." The crown to which one is predestined may therefore be lost as well as won. Hence predestination is not certain. 2. Again, if something is possible, none of its consequences are impossible.

For whatever is contained in the notion of dignity, must be attributed to God. But it belongs to the dignity of a king, that he should have ministers; through whose mediation he provides for his subjects. Therefore much less has God Himself immediate providence over all things. Objection 2: Further, it belongs to providence to order all things to an end. Now the end of everything is its perfection and its good.

But those already judged have no need of being judged again. Therefore Christ's judiciary power does not extend to the angels. Objection 2: Further, the same person cannot be both judge and judged.

Because ignorance excuses from sin either altogether or in part.

Therefore no one sins through certain malice. Objection 2: Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "no one works intending evil."

For if this were the case a sin would be aggravated chiefly by being committed against a just and holy man. But this does not aggravate a sin: because a virtuous man who bears a wrong with equanimity is less harmed by the wrong done him, than others, who, through being scandalized, are also hurt inwardly.

Hence the crown which is the effect of predestination can be both acquired and lost. Therefore predestination cannot be certain.
