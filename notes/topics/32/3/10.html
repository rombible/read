Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. 3. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. 4. And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall he overthrown. 5. So the people of Ninoveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_a/threefold_repentance.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_5_1859/who_can_tell.htm">Who Can Tell?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">With this by way of preface, I shall now somewhat turn aside from the narrative, to address myself to those who are trembling on account of sin and who are in the same position as the men of Nineveh, and like them anxiously desiring mercy.

First, the miserable plight in which the men of Nineveh found themselves; secondly, the scanty reasons which they had for hope; and then, thirdly, I shall observe that we have stronger reasons to compel us to pray,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_5_1859/who_can_tell.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 5: 1859</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/ii_of_the_public_fast.htm">Of the Public Fast. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">A public fast is when, by the authority of the magistrate (Jonah iii. 7; 2 Chron. xx. 3; Ezra viii. 21), either the whole church within his dominion, or some special congregation, whom it concerneth, assemble themselves together, to perform the fore-mentioned duties of humiliation; either for the removing of some public calamity threatened or already inflicted upon them, as the sword, invasion, famine, pestilence, or other fearful sickness (1 Sam. vii. 5, 6; Joel ii. 15; 2 Chron. xx.; Jonah iii.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/ii_of_the_public_fast.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Lewis Bayly&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Practice of Piety</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_it_is_lawful_for_17.htm">Whether it is Lawful for Religious to Wear Coarser Clothes than Others?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem unlawful for religious to wear coarser clothes than others. For according to the Apostle (1 Thess. 5:22) we ought to "refrain from all appearance of evil." Now coarseness of clothes has an appearance of evil; for our Lord said (Mat. 7:15): "Beware of false prophets who come to you in the clothing of sheep": and a gloss on Apoc. 6:8, "Behold a pale horse," says: "The devil finding that he cannot succeed, neither by outward afflictions nor by manifest heresies, sends in advance  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_it_is_lawful_for_17.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_things_known_or_declared.htm">Whether Things Known or Declared Prophetically Can be False?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that things known or declared prophetically can be false. For prophecy is about future contingencies, as stated above (A[3] ). Now future contingencies may possibly not happen; else they would happen of necessity. Therefore the matter of prophecy can be false. Objection 2: Further, Isaias prophesied to Ezechias saying (Is. 38:1): "Take order with thy house, for thou shalt surely die, and shalt not live," and yet fifteen years were added to his life (4 Kings 20:6).

For the commandments of the Church are binding even as the commandments of God, according to Lk. 10:16, "He that heareth you heareth Me." Now all are bound to keep the commandments of God. Therefore in like manner all are bound to keep the fasts appointed by the Church. Objection 2: Further, children especially are seemingly not exempt from fasting, on account of their age: for it is written (Joel 2:15): "Sanctify a fast,"  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_all_are_bound_to_2.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/first_principles_of_the_reformation/concerning_the_sacrament_of_penance.htm">Concerning the Sacrament of Penance</a><br></span><span class="snippet">In this third part I shall speak of the sacrament of penance.
