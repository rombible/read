A warm dispute arose between Judas and the soldiers, because he wished to approach first and speak to Jesus quietly as if nothing was the matter, and then for them to come up and seize our Saviour, thus letting him suppose that he had no connection with the affair. But the men answered rudely, 'Not so, friend, thou shalt not escape  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/emmerich/the_dolorous_passion_of_our_lord_jesus_christ/chapter_iii_jesus_is_arrested.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Anna Catherine Emmerich&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/origen/origen_against_celsus/chapter_xx_let_us_see.htm">Let us See How He Continues after This: "These Events...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Let us see how he continues after this:  "These events," he says, "he predicted as being a God, and the prediction must by all means come to pass.  God, therefore, who above all others ought to do good to men, and especially to those of his own household, led on his own disciples and prophets, with whom he was in the habit of eating and drinking, to such a degree of wickedness, that they became impious and unholy men.

Mercy is the result and effect of God's goodness. Psa 33:5. So then this is the next attribute, God's goodness or mercy. The most learned of the heathens thought they gave their god Jupiter two golden characters when they styled him good and great. Both these meet in God, goodness and greatness, majesty and mercy. God is essentially good in himself and relatively good to us. They are both put together in Psa 119:98. Thou art good, and doest good.'

It constitutes the response of the Church to the divine demands of prophecy, and, in a less degree, of law; or, rather, it expresses those emotions and aspirations of the universal heart which lie deeper than any formal demand. It is the speech of the soul face to face with God. Its words are as simple and unaffected as human words can be, for it is the genius  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/psalms.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aloud.htm">Aloud</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/cast.htm">Cast</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/cry.htm">Cry</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/glad.htm">Glad</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/habitually.htm">Habitually</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/philistia.htm">Philistia</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pot.htm">Pot</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/resting-place.htm">Resting-place</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sandal.htm">Sandal</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shoe.htm">Shoe</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shout.htm">Shout</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/throw.htm">Throw</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/toss.htm">Toss</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/triumph.htm">Triumph</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wash.htm">Wash</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/washbasin.htm">Washbasin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/washbowl.htm">Washbowl</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/washing.htm">Washing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/washpot.htm">Washpot</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wash-pot.htm">Wash-pot</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-1.htm">David encourages himself to praise God</a></span><br><span class="reftext">5. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-5.htm">He prays for God's assistance according to his promise</a></span><br><span class="reftext">11. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-11.htm">His confidence in God's help</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5179.htm"><b>5179</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sandal</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5445.htm"><b>5445</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potters and pottery</a></body></html>
