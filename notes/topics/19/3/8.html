Beware of singing divine psalms for an ordinary recreation, as do men of impure spirits, who sing holy psalms intermingled with profane ballads: They are God's word: take them not in thy mouth in vain. 2. Remember to sing David's psalms with David's spirit (Matt. xxii. 43.) 3. Practise St. Paul's rule--"I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing with the understanding also." (1 Cor. xiv. 15.) 4. As you sing uncover your heads (1 Cor. xi. 4), and behave yourselves in comely reverence as in the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/rules_to_be_observed_in.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Lewis Bayly&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Practice of Piety</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_beatitudes_an_exposition_of_matthew_51-12/3_the_godly_are_in.htm">The Godly are in Some Sense Already Blessed</a><br></span><span class="snippet">I proceed now to the second aphorism or conclusion, that the godly are in some sense already blessed.
