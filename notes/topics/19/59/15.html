Unto Thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.'--PSALM lix. 9, 17. There is an obvious correspondence between these two verses even as they stand in our translation, and still more obviously in the Hebrew. You observe that in the former verse the words 'because of' are a supplement inserted by our translators, because they did not exactly know what to make of the bare words as they  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_j/waiting_and_singing.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kempis/imitation_of_christ/chapter_xx_of_confession_of.htm">Of Confession of Our Infirmity and of the Miseries of this Life</a><br></span><span class="snippet">I will acknowledge my sin unto Thee;(1) I will confess to Thee, Lord, my infirmity.

He has suffered thus, partly from a certain obscurity in his style of writing, partly from the difficulty of the thoughts which he attempted to convey. But there are other reasons for the comparative neglect into which he has fallen. He learnt his theology, as we shall see, from Eastern authorities, and was not content to carry on and develop the traditional teaching of the West; and the disciple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hilary/the_life_and_writings_of_st_hilary_of_poitiers/introduction_chapter_i_the_life_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Hilary of Poitiers&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Writings of St. Hilary of Poitiers</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/xi_the_kingcontinued.htm">The King --Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The years thus well begun are, in the historical books, characterized mainly by three events, namely, the bringing up of the ark to the newly won city of David, Nathan's prophecy of the perpetual dominion of his house, and his victories over the surrounding nations.
