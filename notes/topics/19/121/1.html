My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.' --PSALM cxxi. 1, 2. The so-called 'Songs of Degrees,' of which this psalm is one, are usually, and with great probability, attributed to the times of the Exile. If that be so, we get an appropriate background and setting for the expressions and emotions of this psalm. We see the exile, wearied with the monotony of the long-stretching, flat plains of Babylonia, summoning  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_j/looking_to_the_hills.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bernard/some_letters_of_saint_bernard_abbot_of_clairvaux/letter_xxii_circa_a_d_1129.htm">Letter xxii (Circa A.

I was in great pain and distress; and many prayers, as I said, [1] were made on my behalf, that our Lord would lead me by another and a safer way; for this, they told me, was so suspicious.  The truth is, that though I was praying to God for this, and wished I had a desire for another way, yet, when I saw the progress I was making, I was unable really to desire a change,--though I always prayed for it,--excepting on those occasions when I was extremely cast  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/teresa/the_life_of_st_teresa_of_jesus/chapter_xxvii_the_saint_prays.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Teresa of Avila&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of St. Teresa of Jesus</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/moody/the_way_to_god_and_how_to_find_it/chapter_viii_christ_all_and.htm">Christ all and in All. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">(Colossians iii. 11.)  Christ is all to us that we make Him to be. I want to emphasize that word "all." Some men make Him to be "a root out of a dry ground," "without form or comeliness." He is nothing to them; they do not want Him. Some Christians have a very small Saviour, for they are not willing to receive Him fully, and let Him do great and mighty things for them. Others have a mighty Saviour, because they make Him to be great and mighty.

Another was converted under a bridge; and he thinks that if any enquirer were to go there he would find the Lord.

It constitutes the response of the Church to the divine demands of prophecy, and, in a less degree, of law; or, rather, it expresses those emotions and aspirations of the universal heart which lie deeper than any formal demand. It is the speech of the soul face to face with God.
