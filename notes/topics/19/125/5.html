As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people from henceforth, even for ever.'--PSALM cxxv. 1, 2. The so-called 'Songs of Degrees,' of which this psalm is one, are probably a pilgrim's song-book, and possibly date from the period of the restoration of Israel from the Babylonish captivity. In any case, this little psalm looks very much like a record of the impression  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_j/mountains_round_mount_zion.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_3_1857/the_security_of_the_church.htm">The Security of the Church</a><br></span><span class="snippet">We shall consider the text, first, as relating to the Church as a whole, and then we shall endeavor to note how it applies to every individual in particular.
