Mr. Robert Leighton (afterwards bishop Leighton), being then principal of that college, before the degree was conferred upon them, tendered to them the national and solemn league and covenant; which covenants, upon mature deliberation, he took, finding nothing in them but a short compend of the moral law, binding to our duty towards God and towards  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/howie/biographia_scoticana_scots_worthies/the_life_of_mr_james_5.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Howie&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Biographia Scoticana (Scots Worthies)</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/athanasius/select_works_and_letters_or_athanasius/section_4_vehicles_of_revelation.htm">Vehicles of Revelation; Scripture, the Church, Tradition. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">(a) The supreme and unique revelation of God to man is in the Person of the Incarnate Son.

It was natural, then, that a period full of novelty and of prosperous activity, very unlike the quiet days at Bethlehem, should rather accumulate materials for future use than be fruitful in actual production.

He has suffered thus, partly from a certain obscurity in his style of writing, partly from the difficulty of the thoughts which he attempted to convey. But there are other reasons for the comparative neglect into which he has fallen. He learnt his theology, as we shall see, from Eastern authorities, and was not content to carry on and develop the traditional teaching of the West; and the disciple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hilary/the_life_and_writings_of_st_hilary_of_poitiers/introduction_chapter_i_the_life_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Hilary of Poitiers&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Writings of St. Hilary of Poitiers</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/calvin/the_institutes_of_the_christian_religion/chapter_10_the_resemblance_between.htm">The Resemblance Between the Old Testament and the New. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">1.
