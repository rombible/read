"My Heart is Fixed, O God" (Ps. Lvii. 7). </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"My heart is fixed, O God" (Ps. lvii. 7). We do not always feel joyful, but we are always to count it joy. This word reckon is one of the keywords of Scripture. It is the same word used about our being dead. We are painfully conscious of something which would gladly return to life. But we are to treat ourselves as dead, and neither fear nor obey the old nature. So we are to reckon the thing that comes a blessing; we are determined to rejoice, to say, "My heart is fixed, Lord; I will sing and give  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/june_5_my_heart_is.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.

It is easy to say such things when life goes smoothly with us. But this Psalmist, whether David or another, says this, and means it, when all things are dark and frowning around him. The superscription attributes the words to David himself, fleeing from Saul, and hiding in the cave. Whether that be so or no, the circumstances under which the Psalmist sings are obviously those of very great difficulty and oppression.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_j/the_fixed_heart.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/jowett/my_daily_meditation_for_the_circling_year/january_the_thirty-first_under_his.htm">January the Thirty-First under his Wings</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"In the shadow of Thy wings will I make my refuge." --PSALM lvii.  Could anything be more tenderly gracious than this figure of hiding under the shadow of God's wings? It speaks of bosom-warmth, and bosom-shelter, and bosom-rest. "Let me to Thy bosom fly!" And what strong wings they are! Under those wings I am secure even from the lions. My animal passions shall not hurt me when I am "hiding in God." The fiercest onslaughts of the devil are powerless to break those mighty wings.

He had fled from Saul, his remorseless foe; and had found shelter in the clefts of the rock. In the beginning of this psalm he rings the alarm-bell, and very loud is the sound of it. "Be merciful unto me," and then the clapper hits the other side of the bell. "Be merciful unto me." He utters his misery again and again. "My soul trusteth in thee; yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast."

God is essentially good in himself and relatively good to us. They are both put together in Psa 119:98. Thou art good, and doest good.'
