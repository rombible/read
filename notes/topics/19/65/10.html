There is an intended contrast in these two clauses more pointed and emphatic in the original than in our Bible, between man's impotence and God's power in the face of the fact of sin. The words of the first clause might be translated, with perhaps a little increase of vividness, 'iniquities are too strong for me'; and the 'Thou' of the next clause is emphatically expressed in the original, 'as  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_j/sin_overcoming_and_overcome.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_17_1871/praises_and_vows_accepted_in.htm">Praises and Vows Accepted in Zion</a><br></span><span class="snippet">In fulfillment of this ancient type, we also "have an altar whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle."
