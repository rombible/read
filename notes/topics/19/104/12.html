St Mary's Chester, 1871.  Trinity Sunday. Psalm civ. 31, 33.  "The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever:  The  Lord shall rejoice in his works.  I will sing unto the Lord as long as I  live:  I will sing praise to my God while I have my being." This is Trinity Sunday, on which we think especially of the name of God.   A day which, to a wise man, may well be one of the most solemn, and the  most humiliating days of the whole year.

Heb. 1:14. 1. Many of the ancient Heathens had (probably from tradition) some notion of good and evil angels. They had some conception of a superior order of beings, between men and God, whom the Greeks generally termed demons, (knowing ones,) and the Romans, genii. Some of these they supposed to be kind and benevolent, delighting in doing good; others, to be malicious and cruel, delighting in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/wesley/sermons_on_several_occasions/sermon_71_of_good_angels.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Wesley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sermons on Several Occasions</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_17_1871/lessons_from_nature.htm">Lessons from Nature</a><br></span><span class="snippet">This prejudice against the beauties of the material universe reminds me of the lingering love to Judaism, which acted like a spell upon Peter of old.

He needed that the voice should speak to him from heaven again and again before he would fully learn the lesson, "What God hath cleansed that call not thou common."
