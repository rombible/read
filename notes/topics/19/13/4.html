This whole psalm reads like the sob of a wounded heart. The writer of it is shut out from the Temple of his God, from the holy soil of his native land. One can see him sitting solitary yonder in the lonely wilderness (for the geographical details that occur in one part of the psalm point to his situation as being on the other side of the Jordan, in the mountains of Moab)--can see him sitting there with long wistful gaze yearning across  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_j/thirsting_for_god.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kempis/imitation_of_christ/chapter_xxx_of_seeking_divine.htm">Of Seeking Divine Help, and the Confidence of Obtaining Grace</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"My Son, I the Lord am a stronghold in the day of trouble.(1) Come unto Me, when it is not well with thee.

He has suffered thus, partly from a certain obscurity in his style of writing, partly from the difficulty of the thoughts which he attempted to convey. But there are other reasons for the comparative neglect into which he has fallen. He learnt his theology, as we shall see, from Eastern authorities, and was not content to carry on and develop the traditional teaching of the West; and the disciple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hilary/the_life_and_writings_of_st_hilary_of_poitiers/introduction_chapter_i_the_life_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Hilary of Poitiers&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Writings of St. Hilary of Poitiers</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/tertullian/against_praxeas/elucidations.htm">Elucidations. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">I.

It is the speech of the soul face to face with God.
