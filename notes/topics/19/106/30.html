They found no witness in the quiet daily providence; the unobtrusive miracle of daily mercy did not awake their song. They dwelt upon the "special" blessing, when all the time the really special blessing was to be found in the sleepless care which watched over them in their ordinary and commonplace  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/jowett/my_daily_meditation_for_the_circling_year/june_the_twelfth_waiting_for.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Henry Jowett&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">My Daily Meditation for the Circling Year</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_2_1856/israel_at_the_red_sea.htm">Israel at the Red Sea</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"A few more rolling years at most, Will land me on fair Canaan's coast.'
