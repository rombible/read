For this reason also disobedience is a greater sin than murder, unchastity, theft and dishonesty, and all that these may include.  For we can in no better way learn how to distinguish between greater and lesser sins than by noting the order of the Commandments of God, although there are distinctions also within the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/a_treatise_on_good_works/thou_shalt_honor_thy_father.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Dr. Martin Luther&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Treatise on Good Works</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_x_what_the_rulers.htm">What the Ruler's Discrimination Should be Between Correction and Connivance, Between Fervour and Gentleness. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">It should be known too that the vices of subjects ought sometimes to be prudently connived at, but indicated in that they are connived at; that things, even though openly known, ought sometimes to be seasonably tolerated, but sometimes, though hidden, be closely investigated; that they ought sometimes to be gently reproved, but sometimes vehemently censured.

Jerome, after lamenting that Origen's notes on the psalm are no longer extant, gives the following explanations: The Hebrew phrase "bread of sorrow" is rendered by the LXX. "bread of idols"; by Aquila, "bread of troubles"; by Symmachus, "bread of misery." Theodotion follows the LXX. So does Origen's Fifth Version.

It constitutes the response of the Church to the divine demands of prophecy, and, in a less degree, of law; or, rather, it expresses those emotions and aspirations of the universal heart which lie deeper than any formal demand. It is the speech of the soul face to face with God.
