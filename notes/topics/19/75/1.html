It was undertaken as part of the great series of original translations which appeared "under the patronage of William, Archbishop of Canterbury, from its commencement, a.d. 1836, until his Grace's departure in peace, a.d. 1848." It proposed to include all the "Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church before the division of the East and West," and this exposition was dedicated as a memorial of Archbishop Howley  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/exposition_on_the_book_of_psalms/advertisement.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Augustine&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Exposition on the Book of Psalms</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/athanasius/select_works_and_letters_or_athanasius/section_6_derivative_doctrines_grace.htm">Derivative Doctrines.
