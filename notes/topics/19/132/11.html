They say that those Jews who expected their Messiah to set up a visible and material Kingdom on the earth were mistaken, that they erred in the interpretation of their prophetic Scriptures and cherished a carnal and unworthy hope. Let us examine this assertion in the light of God's Word. In Psalm 132:11 we read "The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David; He will not turn from it: Of the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/pink/the_redeemers_return/1_an_examination_of_post-millennialism.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Arthur W.
