These two psalms are obviously intended as a pair. They are identical in number of verses and in structure, both being acrostic, that is to say, the first clause of each commences with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the second clause with the second, and so on. The general idea that runs through them is the likeness of the godly man to God. That resemblance comes very markedly to the surface at several points in the psalms,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_j/god_and_the_godly.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/jowett/my_daily_meditation_for_the_circling_year/december_the_tenth_the_only.htm">December the Tenth the Only Wise Beginning</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." --PSALM cxi.  If I want to do anything wisely I must begin with God. That is the very alphabet of the matter. Every other beginning is a perverse beginning, and it will end in sure disaster. "I am Alpha." Everything must take its rise in Him, or it will plunge from folly into folly, and culminate in confusion. If I would be wise in my daily business I must begin all my affairs in God.

I said: "My friend, I don't see how you can tear down with one hand what you are trying to build up with the other.
