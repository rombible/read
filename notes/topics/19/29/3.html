Some one remarked once that he did not know more disagreeable people than sanctified Christians. He probably meant people that only profess sanctification. There is an angular, hard, unlovely type of Christian character that is not true holiness; at least, not the highest type of it. It is the skeleton without the flesh covering; it is the naked rock without the vines and foliage that cushion its rugged sides. Jesus was not only virtuous and pure, but He was  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/march_25_the_beauty_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
