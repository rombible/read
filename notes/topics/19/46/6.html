Psalm xlvi. 1.  "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in  trouble." This is a noble psalm, full of hope and comfort; and it will be more and  more full of hope and comfort, the more faithfully we believe in the  incarnation, the passion, the resurrection, and the ascension of our Lord  Jesus Christ.

Some great deliverance, the details of which we do not know, had been wrought for Israel, and this psalmist comes forth, like Miriam with her choir of maidens, to hymn the victory. The psalm throbs with exultation, but no human victor's name degrades the singer's lips. There is only one Conqueror whom he celebrates.
