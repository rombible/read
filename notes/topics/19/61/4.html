"When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than I." That is David's way of expressing it. "We have no might against this company, neither know we what to do."

He learnt his theology, as we shall see, from Eastern authorities, and was not content to carry on and develop the traditional teaching of the West; and the disciple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hilary/the_life_and_writings_of_st_hilary_of_poitiers/introduction_chapter_i_the_life_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Hilary of Poitiers&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Writings of St. Hilary of Poitiers</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_31_1885/the_horns_of_the_altar.htm">The Horns of the Altar</a><br></span><span class="snippet">WE MUST tell you the story. Solomon was to be the king after David, but his elder brother, Adonijah, was preferred by Joab, the captain of the host, and by Abiathar, the priest; and, therefore, they got together, and tried to steal a march upon dying David, and set up Adonijah. They utterly failed in this; and when Solomn came to the throne Adonijah was afraid for his life, and fled to the horns of the altar at the tabernacle for shelter.
