The three parables are three sides of a vast pyramid of gospel doctrine, but there is a distinct inscription upon each. Not only in the similitude, but also in the teaching covered by the similitude, there is variety, progress, enlargement, discrimination.

The words of warning written in the fifth book of Moses had told them plainly that if they turned aside and worshipped the wicked idol-gods of Canaan, the Lord would take their country from them and drive them out into strange lands. Yet again and again they had yielded to temptation.  And now the day of reckoning had come.

He is like a foolish patient who, having a pill prescribed him, licks the sugar but throws away the pill. The libertine is all for joy and comfort. He licks the sugar but throws away the bitter pill of repentance.

D eath, simply considered, is no more than the cessation of life --that which was once living, lives no longer. But it has been the general, perhaps the universal custom of mankind, to personify it. Imagination gives death a formidable appearance, arms it with a dart, sting or scythe, and represents it as an active, inexorable and invincible reality.

He has suffered thus, partly from a certain obscurity in his style of writing, partly from the difficulty of the thoughts which he attempted to convey. But there are other reasons for the comparative neglect into which he has fallen. He learnt his theology, as we shall see, from Eastern authorities, and was not content to carry on and develop the traditional teaching of the West; and the disciple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hilary/the_life_and_writings_of_st_hilary_of_poitiers/introduction_chapter_i_the_life_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Hilary of Poitiers&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Writings of St. Hilary of Poitiers</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/psalms.htm">Psalms</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The piety of the Old Testament Church is reflected with more clearness and variety in the Psalter than in any other book of the Old Testament.

It is the speech of the soul face to face with God.
