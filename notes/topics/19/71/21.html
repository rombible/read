It is a simple law of nature, that air always comes in to fill a vacuum. You can produce a draught at any time, by heating the air until it ascends, and then the cold air rushes in to supply its place. And so we can always be filled with the Holy Spirit by providing a vacuum. This breath is dependent upon exhausting the previous breath before you can inhale a fresh one. And so we must empty our hearts of the last breath  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/december_22_my_tongue_also.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
