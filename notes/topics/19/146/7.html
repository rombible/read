Concerning continence also itself hath it not been most openly said, "And when I knew that no one can be continent unless God give it, this also itself was a part of wisdom, to know whose gift it was?" [2177] But perhaps continence is the gift of God, but wisdom man bestows upon himself, whereby to understand, that that gift is, not his own, but of God. Yea, "The Lord maketh wise the blind:" [2178] and, "The testimony of the Lord is faithful, it giveth wisdom unto little ones:" [2179] and, "If  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/of_holy_virginity_/section_43_concerning_continence_also.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Augustine&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Of Holy Virginity. </span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newton/messiah_vol_1/sermon_xiv_rest_for_the.htm">Rest for the Weary</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
