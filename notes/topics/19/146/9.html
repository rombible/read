Concerning continence also itself hath it not been most openly said, "And when I knew that no one can be continent unless God give it, this also itself was a part of wisdom, to know whose gift it was?" [2177] But perhaps continence is the gift of God, but wisdom man bestows upon himself, whereby to understand, that that gift is, not his own, but of God. Yea, "The Lord maketh wise the blind:" [2178] and, "The testimony of the Lord is faithful, it giveth wisdom unto little ones:" [2179] and, "If  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/of_holy_virginity_/section_43_concerning_continence_also.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Augustine&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Of Holy Virginity. </span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newton/messiah_vol_1/sermon_xiv_rest_for_the.htm">Rest for the Weary</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

It constitutes the response of the Church to the divine demands of prophecy, and, in a less degree, of law; or, rather, it expresses those emotions and aspirations of the universal heart which lie deeper than any formal demand. It is the speech of the soul face to face with God.
