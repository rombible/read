What a violent conjunction, the flint becoming the birthplace of a spring! And yet this is happening every day. Men who are as "hard as flint," whose hearts are "like the nether millstone," become springs of gentleness and fountains of exquisite compassion. Beautiful graces, like lovely ferns, grow in the home of severities, and transform the grim, stern soul into a garden of fragrant friendships. This is what Zacchaeus was like  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/jowett/my_daily_meditation_for_the_circling_year/february_the_third_transforming_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Henry Jowett&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">My Daily Meditation for the Circling Year</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/various/select_masterpieces_of_biblical_literature/rhapsody_2.htm">Rhapsody</a><br></span><span class="snippet">This has been explained in the Introduction (pages xii-xiii) as a term applied to a highly characteristic form of prophetic literature, amounting to spiritual drama: actual dramatic dialogue and action being combined with other literary modes of expression to produce the general effect of dramatic realisation and movement.

Jerome [472] and Cassiodorus [473] speak of nine homilies only on the creation.  Socrates [474] says the Hex&aelig;meron was completed by Gregory of Nyssa.

All things work for good "to them who are called." Though this word called is placed in order after loving of God, yet in nature it goes before it. Love is first named, but not first wrought; we must be called of God, before we can love God. Calling is made (Rom. viii. 30) the middle link of the golden chain of salvation.

It constitutes the response of the Church to the divine demands of prophecy, and, in a less degree, of law; or, rather, it expresses those emotions and aspirations of the universal heart which lie deeper than any formal demand. It is the speech of the soul face to face with God.
