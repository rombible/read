Oh! let my prayer enter into Thy presence.  For my soul is full of trouble and my life draweth nigh unto Hell.  Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in a place of darkness, and in the deep.--Ps. lxxxviii. 1, 2. If I go down to Hell, Thou art there also.  Yea, the darkness is no darkness with Thee; but the night is as clear as the day.--Ps. cxxxix. 7, 11. I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined unto me, and heard my calling.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/out_of_the_deep/v_out_of_the_deep.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Out of the Deep</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/brown/christ_the_way_the_truth_and_the_life/chapter_xvii_how_to_make.htm">How to Make Use of Christ as the Truth, that we May Get Our Case and Condition Cleared up to Us. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The believer is oft complaining of darkness concerning his case and condition, so as he cannot tell what to say of himself, or what judgment to pass on himself, and he knoweth not how to win to a distinct and clear discovery of his state and condition. Now, it is truth alone, and the Truth, that can satisfy them as to this. The question then is, how they shall make use of, and apply themselves to this truth, to the end they may get the truth of their condition discovered to them.

But as soon as his guilt is proven in court and the jury has convicted him, he passes from that into the status of the bound and law-breaking citizen. The same applies to our relation to God.
