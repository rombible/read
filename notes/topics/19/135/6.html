But there are other reasons for the comparative neglect into which he has fallen. He learnt his theology, as we shall see, from Eastern authorities, and was not content to carry on and develop the traditional teaching of the West; and the disciple  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hilary/the_life_and_writings_of_st_hilary_of_poitiers/introduction_chapter_i_the_life_and.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Hilary of Poitiers&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Writings of St. Hilary of Poitiers</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/psalms.htm">Psalms</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The piety of the Old Testament Church is reflected with more clearness and variety in the Psalter than in any other book of the Old Testament.
