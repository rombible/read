With us the Father goes; He leads us, and He guards us Through thousands of our foes: The sweetness and the glory, The sunlight of His eyes, Make all the desert places To glow as paradise.  Lo! through the pathless midnight The fiery pillar leads, And onward goes the Shepherd Before the flock He feeds; Unquestioning, unfearing, The lambs may follow on, In quietness and confidence, Their eyes on Him alone.

According to the Jewish Ritual, the Cup is filled a fourth time, and the remaining part of the Hallel [5717] repeated. Then follow, besides Ps. cxxxvi., a number of prayers and hymns, of which the comparatively late origin is not doubtful. The same remark applies even more strongly to what follows after the fourth Cup. But, so far as we can judge, the Institution of the Holy Supper was followed by the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/chapter_xi_the_last_discourses.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_27_1881/the_minstrel.htm">The Minstrel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">ELISHA needed that the Holy Spirit should come upon him to inspire him with prophetic utterances. "Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." We need that the hand of the Lord should be laid upon us, for we can never open our mouths in wisdom except we are under the divine touch. Now, the Spirit of God works according to his own will. "The wind bloweth where it listeth," and the Spirit of God operates as he chooseth.

The hymn,' with which the Paschal Supper ended, had been sung.

The last Discourses had been spoken, the last Prayer, that of Consecration, had been offered, and Jesus prepared to go forth out of the City, to  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/chapter_xii_gethsemane.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/psalms.htm">Psalms</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The piety of the Old Testament Church is reflected with more clearness and variety in the Psalter than in any other book of the Old Testament. It constitutes the response of the Church to the divine demands of prophecy, and, in a less degree, of law; or, rather, it expresses those emotions and aspirations of the universal heart which lie deeper than any formal demand. It is the speech of the soul face to face with God. Its words are as simple and unaffected as human words can be, for it is the genius  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/psalms.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/og.htm">Og</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/age.htm">Age</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/endures.htm">Endures</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/endureth.htm">Endureth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/everlasting.htm">Everlasting</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/forever.htm">Forever</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heavens.htm">Heavens</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kindness.htm">Kindness</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/love.htm">Love</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/loving.htm">Loving</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lovingkindness.htm">Lovingkindness</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/loving-kindness.htm">Loving-kindness</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mercy.htm">Mercy</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/o.htm">O</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/oh.htm">Oh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/praise.htm">Praise</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/steadfast.htm">Steadfast</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thanks.htm">Thanks</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/unchanging.htm">Unchanging</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-1.htm">An exhortation to give thanks to God for particular mercies.</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1-26</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1085.htm"><b>1085</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, <i>love of</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8352.htm"><b>8352</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thankfulness</a></body></html>
