It may, however, be noted that the Ninth Homily ends abruptly, and the latter, and apparently more important, portion of the subject is treated of at less length than the former. Jerome [472] and Cassiodorus [473] speak of nine homilies only on the creation.  Socrates [474] says the Hex&aelig;meron was completed by Gregory of Nyssa.
