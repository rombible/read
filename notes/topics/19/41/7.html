As we have done before we can only take one or two specimens of these general lessons which Jesus taught. We have one of these in the title to our present chapter, which is--Christ Teaching Liberality. This was a very important lesson for Jesus to teach. One of the sad effects of sin upon our nature is to make it selfish,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newton/the_life_of_jesus_christ_for_the_young/christ_teaching_liberality.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Richard Newton&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of Jesus Christ for the Young</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/teresa/the_life_of_st_teresa_of_jesus/chapter_xxix_of_visions_the.htm">Of visions.

I have wandered far from the subject; for I undertook to give reasons why the vision was no work of the imagination. For how can we, by any efforts of ours, picture to ourselves the Humanity of Christ, and imagine His great beauty?  No little time is necessary, if our conception is in any way to resemble it. Certainly, the imagination may be able to picture it, and a person may for a time contemplate that picture,--the form and the brightness of it,--and gradually make it more perfect, and so  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/teresa/the_life_of_st_teresa_of_jesus/chapter_xxix_of_visions_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Teresa of Avila&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of St. Teresa of Jesus</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/on_prayer_and_the_contemplative_life/question_clxxx_of_the_contemplative.htm">Question of the Contemplative Life</a><br></span><span class="snippet">I.

Man was created with a thirst for knowledge which can never be satiated in this world. Sin, which greatly weakened and darkened his mental faculties, has not taken away his desire and love for knowledge. And the knowledge which he acquired by eating the forbidden fruit, rather increased than satisfied his thirst.

A fourth objection to this doctrine is, that if, by the perseverance of the saints is intended, that they live anything like lives of habitual obedience to God, then facts are against it. To this objection I reply: that by the perseverance of the saints, as I use these terms, is intended that, subsequently to their regeneration, holiness is the rule of their lives, and sin only the exception.
