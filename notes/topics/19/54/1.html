Differently to be admonished are they who even praise the unlawful things which they do, and those who censure what is wrong, and yet avoid it not.  For they who even praise the unlawful things which they do are to be admonished to consider how for the most part they offend more by the mouth than by deeds.  For by deeds they perpetrate wrong things in their own persons only; but with the mouth they bring out wickedness in the persons of as many as there are souls of hearers, to  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_xxxi_how_those_are.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Leo the Great&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Writings of Leo the Great</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/gregory/the_epistles_of_saint_gregory_the_great/epistle_vii_to_peter_domitian.htm">Epistle vii.

I rejoice exceedingly that you welcomed with great joy the ordination of the most holy Cyriacus, my brother and fellow-priest.  And since we have learnt from the preaching of Paul the apostle that If one member rejoice, all the members rejoice with it (1 Cor. xii. 26), you must needs consider with how great exultation I rejoice with you in this thing, wherein not one member, but many members of Christ have  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/gregory/the_epistles_of_saint_gregory_the_great/epistle_vii_to_peter_domitian.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Gregory the Great&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">the Epistles of Saint Gregory the Great</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/teresa/the_life_of_st_teresa_of_jesus/chapter_xx_the_difference_between.htm">The Difference Between Union and Rapture.

[2]  It is more excellent than union, the fruits of it are much greater, and its other operations more manifold; for union is uniform in the beginning, the middle, and the end, and is so also interiorly.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/teresa/the_life_of_st_teresa_of_jesus/chapter_xx_the_difference_between.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Teresa of Avila&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of St. Teresa of Jesus</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/gregory/the_epistles_of_saint_gregory_the_great/epistle_ii_to_anastasius_bishop.htm">Epistle ii.

It is the speech of the soul face to face with God.
