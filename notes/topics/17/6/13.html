For an angel is above any human wayfarer, according to Mat. 11:11, "He that is lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John the Baptist." Yet an angel forbade John when the latter wished to honor him (Apoc. 22:10). Therefore honor is not due to those who are above us. Objection 2: Further, honor is due to a person in acknowledgment of his virtue, as stated above [3162](A[1]; Q[63], A[3]).

For we can in no better way learn how to distinguish between greater and lesser sins than by noting the order of the Commandments of God, although there are distinctions also within the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/luther/a_treatise_on_good_works/thou_shalt_honor_thy_father.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Dr. Martin Luther&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Treatise on Good Works</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newton/messiah_vol_2/sermon_xxxviii_king_of_kings.htm">King of Kings and Lord of Lords</a><br></span><span class="snippet">And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, K ING OF K INGS AND L ORD OF L ORDS T he description of the administration and glory of the Redeemer's Kingdom, in defiance of all opposition, concludes the second part of Messiah Oratorio.

It is never quoted or referred to by Jesus or His apostles, and it is a satisfaction to think that in very early times, and even among Jewish scholars, its right to a place in the canon was hotly contested. Its aggressive fanaticism and fierce hatred of all that lay outside of Judaism were felt by the finer spirits to be false to the more generous instincts that lay at the heart of the Hebrew religion; but by virtue of its very intensity  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/esther.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahasuerus.htm">Ahasuerus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bigthana.htm">Bigthana</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/teresh.htm">Teresh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zeresh.htm">Zeresh</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/susa.htm">Susa</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/able.htm">Able</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/account.htm">Account</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/advisers.htm">Advisers</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/anything.htm">Anything</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/befallen.htm">Befallen</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/begun.htm">Begun</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/better.htm">Better</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/certainly.htm">Certainly</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/descent.htm">Descent</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/downfall.htm">Downfall</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/fall.htm">Fall</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/friends.htm">Friends</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hast.htm">Hast</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jewish.htm">Jewish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/met.htm">Met</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mor'decai.htm">Mor'decai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/origin.htm">Origin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/overcome.htm">Overcome</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/prevail.htm">Prevail</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/recounted.htm">Recounted</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/recounteth.htm">Recounteth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/ruin.htm">Ruin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/seed.htm">Seed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stand.htm">Stand</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/started.htm">Started</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/starting.htm">Starting</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/surely.htm">Surely</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wife.htm">Wife</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wilt.htm">Wilt</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wise.htm">Wise</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zeresh.htm">Zeresh</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm">Xerxes, reading of the good service done by Mordecai, takes care for his reward.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-4.htm">Haman, coming to ask that Mordecai might be hanged, </a></span><br><span class="reftext">10. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-10.htm">gives counsel that he might do him honor.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-12.htm">Complaining of this, his friends tell him of his final destiny.</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-11.htm">Esther 6:11-13</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8797.htm"><b>8797</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persecution, <i>attitudes</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12-13</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/7505.htm"><b>7505</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jews, <i>the</i></a></body></html>
