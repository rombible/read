Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, 5. And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_g/the_net_broken.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_beatitudes_an_exposition_of_matthew_51-12/17_the_blessed_privilege_of.htm">The Blessed Privilege of Seeing God Explained</a><br></span><span class="snippet">They shall see God.
