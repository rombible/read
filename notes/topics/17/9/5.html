Such among the Jews was the feast of the Passover (Exod. xii. 15), to remember to praise God for their deliverance out of Egypt's bondage; or the feast of Purim (Esth. ix. 19, 21), to give thanks for their deliverance from Haman's conspiracy. Such amongst us is the fifth of November, to praise God for the deliverance of the king and  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/of_the_practice_of_piety_2.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Lewis Bayly&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Practice of Piety</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_72_tiberias.htm">Tiberias. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">All the Jews declare, almost with one consent, that this was a fortified city from ancient times, even from the days of Joshua, and was the same with Rakkath, of which mention is made, Joshua 19:35. "Rakkath is Tiberias," say the Jerusalem Gemarists. And those of Babylon say the same, and that more largely: "It is clear to us that Rakkath is Tiberias." And when, after a few lines, this of Rabbi Jochanan was objected, "When I was a boy, I said a certain thing, concerning which I asked the elders,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_72_tiberias.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_98_some_miscellaneous_matters.htm">Some Miscellaneous Matters Respecting the Face of the Land. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">I. Let us begin with that canon concerning reading the Book of Esther in the feast of Purim. "Towns that were begirt with walls from the days of Joshua read it on the fifteenth day" of the month Adar: "Villages and great cities read it the fourteenth day": "Unless that the villages anticipate it, to the day of the congregation." You see a threefold distinction of cities and towns: 1. Fortifications, or towns girt with walls from the days of Joshua. But whence shall we know them? They are those which  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_98_some_miscellaneous_matters.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/renan/the_life_of_jesus/chapter_i_place_of_jesus.htm">Place of Jesus in the History of the World. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The great event of the History of the world is the revolution by which the noblest portions of humanity have passed from the ancient religions, comprised under the vague name of Paganism, to a religion founded on the Divine Unity, the Trinity, and the Incarnation of the Son of God. It has taken nearly a thousand years to accomplish this conversion. The new religion had itself taken at least three hundred years in its formation. But the origin of the revolution in question with which we have to do  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/renan/the_life_of_jesus/chapter_i_place_of_jesus.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernest Renan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of Jesus</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/esther.htm">Esther</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The spirit of the book of Esther is anything but attractive. It is never quoted or referred to by Jesus or His apostles, and it is a satisfaction to think that in very early times, and even among Jewish scholars, its right to a place in the canon was hotly contested. Its aggressive fanaticism and fierce hatred of all that lay outside of Judaism were felt by the finer spirits to be false to the more generous instincts that lay at the heart of the Hebrew religion; but by virtue of its very intensity  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/esther.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abihail.htm">Abihail</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/adalia.htm">Adalia</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahasuerus.htm">Ahasuerus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aridai.htm">Aridai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aridatha.htm">Aridatha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/arisai.htm">Arisai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aspatha.htm">Aspatha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/dalphon.htm">Dalphon</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hammedatha.htm">Hammedatha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/parmashta.htm">Parmashta</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/parshandatha.htm">Parshandatha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/poratha.htm">Poratha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vajezatha.htm">Vajezatha</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/susa.htm">Susa</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/attackers.htm">Attackers</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/desire.htm">Desire</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/destroying.htm">Destroying</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/destruction.htm">Destruction</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hated.htm">Hated</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/haters.htm">Haters</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hating.htm">Hating</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/killing.htm">Killing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/overcame.htm">Overcame</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pleased.htm">Pleased</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pleasure.htm">Pleasure</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/slaughter.htm">Slaughter</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/slaughtering.htm">Slaughtering</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/smite.htm">Smite</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/smiting.htm">Smiting</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/smote.htm">Smote</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stroke.htm">Stroke</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/struck.htm">Struck</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sword.htm">Sword</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thus.htm">Thus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wanted.htm">Wanted</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/whatever.htm">Whatever</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-1.htm">The Jews slay their enemies, with the ten sons of Haman.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-12.htm">Xerxes, at the request of Esther, </a></span><br><span class="reftext">14. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-14.htm">grants another day of slaughter, and Haman's sons to be hanged.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">20. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-20.htm">The two days of Purim are instituted.</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-5.htm">Esther 9:5</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5493.htm"><b>5493</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retribution</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5496.htm"><b>5496</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revenge, <i>examples</i></a></body></html>
