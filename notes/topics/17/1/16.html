For lying is opposed to truth. But it is possible to boast even without lying, as when a man makes a show of his own excellence. Thus it is written (Esther 1:3,4) that Assuerus "made a great feast . . . that he might show the riches of the glory" and "of his kingdom, and the greatness and boasting of his power."

It is never quoted or referred to by Jesus or His apostles, and it is a satisfaction to think that in very early times, and even among Jewish scholars, its right to a place in the canon was hotly contested. Its aggressive fanaticism and fierce hatred of all that lay outside of Judaism were felt by the finer spirits to be false to the more generous instincts that lay at the heart of the Hebrew religion; but by virtue of its very intensity  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/esther.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abagtha.htm">Abagtha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/admatha.htm">Admatha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahasuerus.htm">Ahasuerus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bigtha.htm">Bigtha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/biztha.htm">Biztha</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/carcas.htm">Carcas</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/carshena.htm">Carshena</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/harbona.htm">Harbona</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/marsena.htm">Marsena</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mehuman.htm">Mehuman</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/memucan.htm">Memucan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/meres.htm">Meres</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/persians.htm">Persians</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shethar.htm">Shethar</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/tarshish.htm">Tarshish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vashti.htm">Vashti</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zethar.htm">Zethar</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ethiopia.htm">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/india.htm">India</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/media.htm">Media</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/persia.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/susa.htm">Susa</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahasuerus.htm">Ahasuerus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahasu-e'rus.htm">Ahasu-e'rus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/captains.htm">Captains</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/divisions.htm">Divisions</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heads.htm">Heads</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kingdom.htm">Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/memucan.htm">Memucan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/memu'can.htm">Memu'can</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/nobles.htm">Nobles</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/peoples.htm">Peoples</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/perversely.htm">Perversely</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/presence.htm">Presence</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/princes.htm">Princes</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/provinces.htm">Provinces</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/q/queen.htm">Queen</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/replied.htm">Replied</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/vashti.htm">Vashti</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wrong.htm">Wrong</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wronged.htm">Wronged</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/x/xerxes.htm">Xerxes</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Xerxes makes royal feasts.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">10. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-10.htm">Vashti, sent for, refuses to come.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">13. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-13.htm">Xerxes, by the counsel of Memucan, puts away Vashti, and decrees men's sovereignty.</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5723.htm"><b>5723</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nobles</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-9.htm">Esther 1:9-21</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5745.htm"><b>5745</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-13.htm">Esther 1:13-22</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5779.htm"><b>5779</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advice</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-15.htm">Esther 1:15-18</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5487.htm"><b>5487</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queen</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-16.htm">Esther 1:16-18</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5838.htm"><b>5838</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disrespect</a></body></html>
