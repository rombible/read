Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.--If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

MY DEAR SISTER, In view of the positive injunction of Scripture, above quoted, no argument is necessary to show that self-examination is a duty.
