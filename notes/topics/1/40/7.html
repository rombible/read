S. Matt. ix. 4. "Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?"  INTRODUCTION.--Thoughts are only thoughts! who is to beheld accountable for them?  They are clouds blown about by fancy, taking various shapes. God is not so hard as to judge us for our thoughts; He will try us by what we have done, not by what we have dreamed.  No garden is without weeds; there are tares in every cornfield.  Who speak thus?  Is it those who are conscientious and scrupulous to drive away evil thoughts?  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/baring-gould/the_village_pulpit_volume_ii_trinity_to_advent/lvi_evil_thoughts.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">S.

In measured and dignified language it introduces the story of Israel's origin and settlement upon the land of Canaan (Gen.--Josh.) by the story of creation, i.-ii. 4a, and thus suggests, at the very beginning, the far-reaching purpose and the world-wide significance of the people and religion of Israel.
