It is a blessed thing to revisit our early altars. It is good to return to the haunts of early vision. Places and things have their sanctifying influences, and can recall us to lost experiences. I know a man to whom the scent of a white, wild rose is always a call to prayer. I know another to whom Grasmere is always the window of holy vision.

The heart of the child has the same needs--the same capacity in kind--as that of the aged.  It needs God. Unless it knows Him, and His love is there, it is empty; and, in its fleeting character, childhood proves its vanity.  But this makes us quite sure that if childhood can feel the need, then God has, in His wide grace, met the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/jennings/old_groans_and_new_songs/chapter_xii_our_last_chapter.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">F.

'Full of years' does not seem to me to be a mere synonym for longevity. That would be an intolerable tautology, for we should then have the same thing said three times over--'an old man,' 'in a good old age,' 'full of years.' There must be some other idea than that in the words.

We have shown that the will of the natural man is neither Sovereign nor free but, instead, a servant and slave. We have argued that a right conception of the sinner's will-its servitude-is essential to a just estimate of his depravity and ruin.
