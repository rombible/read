First, we have the dove going forth from the ark, and finding no rest upon the wild and drifting waste of sin and judgment. This represents the Old Testament period, perhaps, when the Holy Ghost visited this sinful world, but could find no resting-place, and went back to the bosom of God. Next, we have the dove going forth and returning with the olive leaf in her mouth, the symbol and the pledge of peace and reconciliation,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/december_27_he_sent_forth.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
