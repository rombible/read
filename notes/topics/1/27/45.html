There is a great question about Lying, which often arises in the midst of our every day business, and gives us much trouble, that we may not either rashly call that a lie which is not such, or decide that it is sometimes right to tell a lie, that is, a kind of honest, well-meant, charitable lie. This question we will painfully discuss by seeking with them that seek: whether to any good purpose, we need not take upon ourselves to affirm, for the attentive reader will sufficiently gather from the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/on_lying/section_1_there_is_a.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Augustine&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">On Lying</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/gregory/the_epistles_of_saint_gregory_the_great/epistle_lii_to_natalis_bishop.htm">Epistle Lii.
