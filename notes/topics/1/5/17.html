You see that these three fragments, in their resemblances and in their differences, are equally significant and instructive.

In the preceding pages we have shown that the translation, "in Our image," actually means, "after Our image." To make anything in an image is no language; it is unthinkable, logically untrue. We now proceed to show how it should be translated, and give our reason for it. We begin with citing some passages from the Old Testament in which occurs the preposition "B" which, in Gen. i. 27, stands before image, where  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/viii_after_the_scripture.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/vii_the_neo-kohlbruggians.htm">The Neo-Kohlbruggians. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth."--Gen. v. 3.

After man's first transgression, he was shut out from the tree of life, and cast out of the garden, by which was signified his seclusion and sequestration from the presence of God, and communion with him: and this was in a manner the extermination of all mankind in one, when Adam was driven out of paradise.
