To maintain a modern and wholly uncatholic system of Penitence, the schoolmen invented a technical scheme of sins mortal and sins venial, which must not be read into the Fathers, who had no such technicalities in mind. By "deadly sins" they meant all such as St. John recognizes (1 John v. 16-17) and none other; that is to say sins of surprise and infirmity, sins having in them no malice or wilful disobedience, such as an impatient word, or a momentary neglect of  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/tertullian/the_five_books_against_marcion/elucidations.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Tertullian&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Five Books Against Marcion</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_body_of_divinity/2_a_believers_privilege_at.htm">A Believer's Privilege at Death</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.'
