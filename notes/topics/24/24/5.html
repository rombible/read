Of the manner in which the great Supreme as God acts, as well as of Himself, our knowledge is limited. Yet though even of the effects on creatures of His doings we know little, we have reason to rejoice that, in His word He has informed us, and in His providence illustrated by that word, he has given us to  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_ii_manner_of_covenanting.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Cunningham&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ordinance of Covenanting</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The interest of the book of Jeremiah is unique.
