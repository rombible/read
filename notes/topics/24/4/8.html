Last Saturday week some two hundred or more miners descended in health and strength to their usual work in the bowels of the earth. They had not been working long, their wives and their children had risen, and their little ones had gone to their schools, when suddenly there was heard a noise at the mouth of the pit;--it was an explosion,--all knew what it meant. Men's hearts failed them, for well they prophesied the horror which  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_7_1861/the_wailing_of_risca.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 7: 1861</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/leo/writings_of_leo_the_great/chapter_xxxii_how_those_are.htm">How those are to be Admonished who Sin from Sudden Impulse and those who Sin Deliberately. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">(Admonition 33.).  Differently to be admonished are those who are overcome by sudden passion and those who are bound in guilt of set purpose.  For those whom sudden passion overcomes are to be admonished to regard themselves as daily set in the warfare of the present life, and to protect the heart, which cannot foresee wounds, with the shield of anxious fear; to dread the hidden darts of the ambushed foe, and, in so dark a contest, to guard with continual attention the inward camp of the soul.

'By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,' &c. Rom 5:12.

In his last farewell, when he was ascending to heaven, he commanded that Repentance should be preached in his name.' Luke 24: 47.
