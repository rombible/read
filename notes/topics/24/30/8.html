"For who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto Me? saith the Lord."--Jer. xxx. 21.  A year, another year is fled; Its issues who can tell? Millions of voices of the dead Reply from heaven or hell.  All these were living at the birth Of the departed year; They all have vanish'd from the earth, We fill their places here.  Though to the eye, the ear, the mind Of man their speech is seal'd, The eternal meaning each may find, In two plain words reveal'd.

We see it in his more emphasised testimony to the Christ; in his fuller comprehension of those prophecies which had formed the warrant and substance of his Mission; but specially in the yet more entire self-abnegation, which led him to take up a still lowlier position, and acquiescingly to realise that his task of heralding  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/the_life_and_times_of_jesus_the_messiah/chapter_iii_the_twofold_testimony.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_vi_covenanting_provided_for.htm">Covenanting Provided for in the Everlasting Covenant. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The duty of Covenanting is founded on the law of nature; but it also stands among the arrangements of Divine mercy made from everlasting. The promulgation of the law, enjoining it on man in innocence as a duty, was due to God's necessary dominion over the creatures of his power. The revelation of it as a service obligatory on men in a state of sin, arose from his unmerited grace. In the one display, we contemplate the authority of the righteous moral Governor of the universe; in the other, we see  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_vi_covenanting_provided_for.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Cunningham&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ordinance of Covenanting</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The interest of the book of Jeremiah is unique. On the one hand, it is our most reliable and elaborate source for the long period of history which it covers; on the other, it presents us with prophecy in its most intensely human phase, manifesting itself through a strangely attractive personality that was subject to like doubts and passions with ourselves. At his call, in 626 B.C., he was young and inexperienced, i. 6, so that he cannot have been born earlier than 650.
