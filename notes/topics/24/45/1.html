Seek them not; for behold I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest" (Jer. xlv. 5).

Certainly it is greater than those great things he would not have Baruch to seek after, and yet he charges us to seek after it.
