Reverence for the old paths is a chief Christian duty.  We look to the future indeed with hope; yet this need not stand in the way of our dwelling on the past days of the Church with affection and deference. This is the feeling of our own Church, as continually expressed in the Prayer Book;--not to slight what has gone before,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_vii/sermon_xviii_stedfastness_in_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Henry Newman&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Parochial and Plain Sermons, Vol. VII</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_6_1860/a_blast_of_the_trumpet.htm">A Blast of the Trumpet against False Peace</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The motive with these false prophets is an abominable one.

God is love, or he is benevolent, and cannot therefore will the misery of any being as an ultimate end, or for its own sake.
