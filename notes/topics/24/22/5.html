Mr. Robert Leighton (afterwards bishop Leighton), being then principal of that college, before the degree was conferred upon them, tendered to them the national and solemn league and covenant; which covenants, upon mature deliberation, he took, finding nothing in them but a short compend of the moral law, binding to our duty towards God and towards  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/howie/biographia_scoticana_scots_worthies/the_life_of_mr_james_5.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Howie&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Biographia Scoticana (Scots Worthies)</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/neander/light_in_the_dark_places/columban.htm">Columban. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">THE wild districts of Ireland were occupied with convents, after the example of Patrick, and cultivated by the hard labour of the monks. The Irish convents were distinguished by their strict Christian discipline, their diligence and their zeal in the study of the Scriptures, and of science in general, as far as they had the means of acquiring it. Irish monks brought learning from Britain and Gaul, they treasured up this learning and elaborated it in the solitude of the convent, and they are said  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/neander/light_in_the_dark_places/columban.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Augustus Neander&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Light in the Dark Places</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/binning/the_works_of_the_rev_hugh_binning/sermon_viii_hear_the_word.htm">"Hear the Word of the Lord, Ye Rulers of Sodom, Give Ear unto the Law of Our God, Ye People of Gomorrah,"</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Isaiah i. 10, 11, &c.--"Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah," &c.
