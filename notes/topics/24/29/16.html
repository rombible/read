(Jeremiah xxix. 13.)  The words of Jeremiah in their relation to God are very appropriate for men and women in whose hearts there is any longing after personal Holiness. Look at them: 'Ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart'. I like this word, because it turns our minds to the true and only source of light and life and power. We speak of seeking and getting the blessing; but,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/howard/standards_of_life_and_service/iv_finding_god.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">T.

Here we have a summary of the teaching of our Lord Jesus on prayer. Nothing will so much help to convince us of the sin of our remissness in prayer, to discover its causes, and to give us courage to expect entire deliverance, as the careful study and then the believing acceptance of that teaching.

"And ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart."--Jer. xxix. 13. IN his fine book on Benefits, Seneca says that nothing is so costly to us as that is which we purchase by prayer. When we come on that hard-to-be-understood saying of his for the first time, we set it down as another of the well-known paradoxes of the Stoics. For He who is far more to us than all the Stoics taken together has said to us on the subject of prayer,--"Ask,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/whyte/lord_teach_us_to_pray/xvi_the_costliness_of_prayer.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Whyte&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Lord Teach Us To Pray</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bounds/the_weapon_of_prayer/ii_putting_god_to_work.htm">Putting God to Work</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside thee who worketh for him that waiteth for him."--Isaiah 64:4. The assertion voiced in the title given this chapter is but another way of declaring that God has of His own motion placed Himself under the law of prayer, and has obligated Himself to answer the prayers of men. He has ordained prayer as a means whereby He will do things through men as they pray, which He would not otherwise do.
