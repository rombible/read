The words rendered 'strangers scattered' are literally 'sojourners of the Dispersion,' and are so rendered in the Revised Version. The Dispersion was the recognised name for the Jews dwelling in Gentile countries; as, for instance, it is employed in John's Gospel, when the people in Jerusalem say, 'Whither will this man go that we shall not find Him? Will he go to the Dispersion amongst the Greeks?'

Christianity has transformed hope, and given it a new importance, by opening to it a new world to move in, and supplying to it new guarantees to rest on. There is something very remarkable in the prominence given to hope in the New Testament, and in the power ascribed to it to order a noble life.

Note these three subsidiary clauses introduced respectively by 'in,' 'through,' 'unto.' They give the means, the Bestower, and the issue of the purity of soul. The Revised Version, following good authorities, omits the clause, 'through the Spirit.' It may possibly be originally a marginal gloss of some scribe who was nervous about Peter's orthodoxy, which finally found its  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/purifying_the_soul.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/by_through_unto.htm">By, Through, Unto</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'...

The Revised Version substitutes 'guarded' for 'kept,' and the alteration, though slight, is important, for it not only more accurately preserves the meaning of the word employed, but it retains the military metaphor which is in it. The force of the expression will appear if I refer, in a sentence, to other cases in which it is employed in the New Testament.

The Apostle is fond of that word 'precious.' In both his letters he uses it as an epithet for diverse things. According to one translation, he speaks of Christ as 'precious to you which believe.' He certainly speaks of 'the precious blood of Christ,' and of 'exceeding great and precious promises,' and here in my text,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/the_true_gold_and_its.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture Ephesians, Peter,John</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_ephesians_peter/joy_in_believing.htm">Joy in Believing</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'In Whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.'--1 Peter i. 8.

Now, in speaking of these two lives, the apostle brings out, first of all, a comparison and a contrast between the two births, for each  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_7_1861/the_new_nature.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 7: 1861</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/arnold/the_christian_life/lecture_xxxix_colossians_iii_17.htm">Colossians iii. 17</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.
