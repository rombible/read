From the beautiful description given there of the garden of Eden--man's abode--we understand that God was interested in his felicity. In the nature of created things he could retain this happiness only by obedience to the Creator's laws. By a subtle foe he was induced to transgress those laws and thus became acquainted with sin and sorrow. After the transgression he  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/orr/the_gospel_day_/the_gospel_day_seen_in.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Ebert Orr&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Gospel Day </span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_the_judgment_will_take_2.htm">Whether the Judgment Will Take Place in the Valley of Josaphat?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that the judgment will not take place in the valley of Josaphat or in the surrounding locality. For at least it will be necessary for those to be judged to stand on the ground, and those alone to be raised aloft whose business it will be to judge. But the whole land of promise would not be able to contain the multitude of those who are to be judged. Therefore it is impossible for the judgment to take place in the neighborhood of that valley.
