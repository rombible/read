Westminster Abbey.  November 8, 1874. Colossians. iii 15.  "Let the peace of God rule in your hearts." The peace of God.  That is what the priest will invoke for you all, when  you leave this abbey.  Do you know what it is?  Whether you do or not,  let me tell you in a few words, what I seem to myself to have learned  concerning that peace.  What it is? how we can obtain it? and why so many  do not obtain it, and are, therefore, not at peace? It is worth while to do so.
