Is any merry? let him sing psalms" (James 5:13). Therefore, common sense itself dictates, that as we are too sluggish, we must be stimulated by God to pray earnestly whenever the occasion requires. This David calls a time when God "may be found" (a seasonable time); because, as he declares in several other  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/calvin/of_prayer--a_perpetual_exercise_of_faith/chapter_7_if_it_is.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Calvin&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Of Prayer--A Perpetual Exercise of Faith</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/calvin/of_prayer--a_perpetual_exercise_of_faith/chapter_27_on_the_whole.htm">On the Whole, Since Scripture Places the Principal Part of Worship in the Invocation Of...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">On the whole, since Scripture places the principal part of worship in the invocation of God (this being the office of piety which he requires of us in preference to all sacrifices), it is manifest sacrilege to offer prayer to others. Hence it is said in the psalm: "If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god, shall not God search this out?" (Ps. 44:20, 21).

Let us also pray after their example, that like them we too may be heard. Those men, on the contrary, absurdly argue that none will be heard but those who have been heard already.
