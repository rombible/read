They took to themselves great credit for skill in learning and in language, and as most men do who are wise in their own esteem, they made a wrong use of their wisdom and learning--they began to criticise the apostle Paul. They criticised his style. "His letters," say they, "are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible." Nay, not content with that, they went so far as to deny his apostleship, and for once  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_4_1858/self-examination.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 4: 1858</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/regester/the_worship_of_the_church/how_to_use_the_prayer-book.htm">How to Use the Prayer-Book</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Before the Service.--If possible be in your place a few moments before the appointed hour, that you may collect your thoughts and prepare for the service.
