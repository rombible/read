There is a prosperity which is not blessed: it comes not from above but from beneath, and it leads away from, not towards heaven. This prosperity of the wicked is often a sore perplexity to the servants of GOD; they need to be reminded of the exhortation, "Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass." Many besides the Psalmist have been envious at the foolish when seeing the prosperity of the wicked, and have been  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/taylor/a_ribband_of_blue/blessed_prosperity_meditations_on_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">J.
