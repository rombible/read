It is often made a charge against professing Christians that their religion has very little to do with common morality. The taunt has sharpened multitudes of gibes and been echoed in all sorts of tones: it is very often too true and perfectly just, but if ever it is, let it be distinctly understood that it is not so because of Christian  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_b/hope_and_holiness.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_b/sorrow_according_to_god.htm">Sorrow According to God</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.'--2 COR. vii. 10.  Very near the close of his missionary career the Apostle Paul summed up his preaching as being all directed to enforcing two points, 'Repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.' These two, repentance and faith, ought never to be separated in thought, as they are inseparable in fact.

Rome denies the total corruption of the will by sin; that its disposition is wholly evil. Hence, the will of the sinner not being wholly useless, it follows: (1) that the regenerate does not need the implanting of a new disposition; (2) that in this respect there is no difference  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/ix_implanted_dispositions.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_body_of_divinity/brief_memoir_of_thomas_watson.htm">Brief Memoir of Thomas Watson</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Compiled by C.
