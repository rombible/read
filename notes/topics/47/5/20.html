This letter to the Thessalonians is the oldest book of the New Testament. It was probably written within something like twenty years of the Crucifixion; long, therefore, before any of the Gospels were in existence. It is, therefore, exceedingly interesting and instructive to notice how this whole context is saturated with allusions to our Lord's teaching,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_b/the_work_and_armour_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/beibitz/gloria_crucis/v_the_great_reconciliation.htm">The Great Reconciliation</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself."  2 COR. V. 19. Such considerations as we have had before us, are of far more than theoretical interest.  They are of all questions the most practical.  Sin is not a curious object which we examine from an aloof and external standpoint.  However we regard it, to whatever view of its nature we are led, it is, alas, a fact within and not merely outside our experience.

Knowledge and ignorance, doubt and certitude, are remarkably blended in these words. The Apostle knows what many men are not certain of; the Apostle doubts as to what all men now are certain of. 'If our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved'--there is surely no if about that.

It is a dangerous thing to be unlike other people. It is still more dangerous to be better than other people. The world has a little heap of depreciatory terms which it flings, age after age, at all men who have a higher standard and nobler aims than their fellows. A favourite term is 'mad.' So, long ago they said, 'The prophet is a fool; the spiritual man is mad,' and, in His turn, Jesus was said to be 'beside Himself,' and Festus shouted from  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/romans_corinthians_to_ii_corinthians_chap_v/the_love_that_constrains.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Romans, Corinthians (To II Corinthians, Chap.

We do not usually care very much for, or very much trust, a man's own statement of the motives of his life, especially if in the statement he takes credit for lofty and noble ones. And it would be rather a dangerous experiment for the ordinary run of so-called Christian people to stand up and say what Paul says here, that the supreme design and aim towards which all their lives are directed is to please Jesus Christ.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/romans_corinthians_to_ii_corinthians_chap_v/pleasing_christ.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Romans, Corinthians (To II Corinthians, Chap.

First, then, let us consider THE CHRISTIAN'S POSITION--he is said to be "in Christ."
