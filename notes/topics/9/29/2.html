'The word of the Lord came to him, and He said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?'--1 KINGS xix. 9.  I have put these two verses together, not only because of their identity in form, though that is striking, but because they bear upon one and the same subject, as will appear, if, in a word or two, I set each of them in its setting.

And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua, Saul's sons. 3. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. 4. Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumsised  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/the_end_of_self-will.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/one_fold_and_one_shepherd.htm">One Fold and one Shepherd</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 2.

So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David king over Israel. 4.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jezreel.htm">Jezreel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/aphek_2.htm">Aphek</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/hebron.htm">Hebron</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/a'chish.htm">A'chish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hundreds.htm">Hundreds</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lords.htm">Lords</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/marched.htm">Marched</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/marching.htm">Marching</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/passed.htm">Passed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/passing.htm">Passing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/princes.htm">Princes</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/proceeding.htm">Proceeding</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rear.htm">Rear</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rearward.htm">Rearward</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rulers.htm">Rulers</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thousands.htm">Thousands</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/units.htm">Units</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-1.htm">David marching with the Philistines</a></span><br><span class="reftext">3. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-3.htm">is disallowed by their princes</a></span><br><span class="reftext">6. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-6.htm">Achish dismisses him, with commendations of his fidelity</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5509.htm"><b>5509</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rulers</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1-11</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8830.htm"><b>8830</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspicion</a></body></html>
