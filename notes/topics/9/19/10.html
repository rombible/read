And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth" (1 Sam. xix. 18)--or, as the word probably means, in the collection of students' dwellings, inhabited by the sons of the prophets, where possibly there may have been some kind of right of sanctuary. Driven thence by Saul's following him, and having had one last sorrowful hour of Jonathan's companionship--the last but one on earth--he fled to Nob, whither  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/v_the_exilecontinued.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of David</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_divine_cordial/why_all_things_work_for.htm">Why all Things Work for Good</a><br></span><span class="snippet">1. The grand reason why all things work for good, is the near and dear interest which God has in His people. The Lord has made a covenant with them.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/naioth.htm">Naioth</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ramah_4.htm">Ramah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/secu.htm">Secu</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/drove.htm">Drove</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/during.htm">During</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/eluded.htm">Eluded</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/escape.htm">Escape</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/escaped.htm">Escaped</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/escapeth.htm">Escapeth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/fled.htm">Fled</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/flight.htm">Flight</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/freeth.htm">Freeth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/got.htm">Got</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/javelin.htm">Javelin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pin.htm">Pin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pinning.htm">Pinning</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/presence.htm">Presence</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul's.htm">Saul's</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/seeketh.htm">Seeketh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/slipped.htm">Slipped</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/smite.htm">Smite</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/smiteth.htm">Smiteth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/smote.htm">Smote</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sought.htm">Sought</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spear.htm">Spear</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/struck.htm">Struck</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/stuck.htm">Stuck</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/tried.htm">Tried</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wall.htm">Wall</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-1.htm">Elkanah, a Levite, having two wives, worships yearly at Shiloh</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-4.htm">He cherishes Hannah, though barren, and provoked by Peninnah</a></span><br><span class="reftext">9. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-9.htm">Hannah in grief prays for a child</a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-12.htm">Eli first rebuking her, afterwards blesses her</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-19.htm">Hannah, having born Samuel, stays at home till he is weaned</a></span><br><span class="reftext">24. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">She presents him, according to her vow, to the Lord</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-9.htm">1 Samuel 19:9-10</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4132.htm"><b>4132</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demons, <i>malevolence</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5088.htm"><b>5088</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, <i>character</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5964.htm"><b>5964</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temper</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-9.htm">1 Samuel 19:9-17</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5086.htm"><b>5086</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, <i>rise of</i></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5890.htm"><b>5890</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insecurity</a></body></html>
