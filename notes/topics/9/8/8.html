And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 6. But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. 7. And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/make_us_a_king.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/the_new_garment_bent.htm">The New Garment Bent</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'And Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king. 27.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abiah.htm">Abiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/beersheba.htm">Beersheba</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/egypt.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ramah_4.htm">Ramah</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/acting.htm">Acting</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bringing.htm">Bringing</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/day-in.htm">Day-in</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/deeds.htm">Deeds</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/forsake.htm">Forsake</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/forsaken.htm">Forsaken</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/forsaking.htm">Forsaking</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gods.htm">Gods</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gods-so.htm">Gods-so</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/serve.htm">Serve</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/served.htm">Served</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/serving.htm">Serving</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/till.htm">Till</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/turning.htm">Turning</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wherewith.htm">Wherewith</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/works.htm">Works</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/worshipping.htm">Worshipping</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-1.htm">By occasion of the ill government of Samuel's sons, the Israelites ask a king</a></span><br><span class="reftext">6. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-6.htm">Samuel praying in grief is comforted by God</a></span><br><span class="reftext">10. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-10.htm">He tells the manner of a king</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-19.htm">God wills Samuel to yield unto the importunity of the people</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-1.htm">1 Samuel 8:1-8</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/7735.htm"><b>7735</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaders, <i>political</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4-9</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5366.htm"><b>5366</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-8</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5889.htm"><b>5889</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ingratitude</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8841.htm"><b>8841</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unfaithfulness, <i>to people</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-9</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5548.htm"><b>5548</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speech, <i>divine</i></a></body></html>
