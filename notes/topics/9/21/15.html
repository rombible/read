The Miraculous Details.--To the category of the improbable--the fiction of hagiology or the growth of myth--belong the miracles so freely ascribed to Ephraim and the miraculous events represented as attending on his career.  It is noteworthy that Ephraim himself, though no doubt he believed that he was  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/ephraim/hymns_and_homilies_of_ephraim_the_syrian/v_historical_criticism_of_mediaeval_amplifications.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ephraim the Syrian&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Hymns and Homilies of Ephraim the Syrian</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/v_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"So David fled, and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done unto him.

Driven thence by Saul's following him, and having had one last sorrowful hour of Jonathan's companionship--the last but one on earth--he fled to Nob, whither  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/v_the_exilecontinued.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of David</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/i_of_preparation.htm">Of Preparation. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">That a Christian ought necessarily to prepare himself before he presume to be a partaker of the holy communion, may evidently appear by five reasons:-- First, Because it is God's commandment; for if he commanded, under the pain of death, that none uncircumcised should eat the paschal lamb (Exod. xii. 48), nor any circumcised under four days preparation, how much greater preparation does he require of him that comes to receive the sacrament of his body and blood? which, as it succeeds, so doth it  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bayly/the_practice_of_piety/i_of_preparation.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Lewis Bayly&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Practice of Piety</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/against_lying/section_24_touching_jacob_however.htm">Touching Jacob, However, that which He did at his Mother's Bidding...</a><br></span><span class="snippet">24.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahimelech.htm">Ahimelech</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/doeg.htm">Doeg</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/elah.htm">Elah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gath.htm">Gath</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/nob.htm">Nob</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/valley_of_elah.htm">Valley of Elah</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/act.htm">Act</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bring.htm">Bring</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/carry.htm">Carry</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/fellow.htm">Fellow</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/front.htm">Front</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lack.htm">Lack</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mad.htm">Mad</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/madman.htm">Madman</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mad-man.htm">Mad-man</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/madmen.htm">Madmen</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mad-men.htm">Mad-men</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/play.htm">Play</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/presence.htm">Presence</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/rave.htm">Rave</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/tricks.htm">Tricks</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/unbalanced.htm">Unbalanced</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm">David at Nob obtains Ahimelech's hallowed bread</a></span><br><span class="reftext">7. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-7.htm">Doeg is present</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-8.htm">David takes Goliath's sword</a></span><br><span class="reftext">10. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm">David at Gath feigns himself insane</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5401.htm"><b>5401</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;madness</a></body></html>
