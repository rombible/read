And he offered the burnt offering."--1 Samuel xiii. 9.  We are all on our trial.  Every one who lives is on his trial, whether he will serve God or not.  And we read in Scripture of many instances of the trials upon which Almighty God puts us His creatures.  In the beginning, Adam, when he was first created, was put upon his trial.  He was placed in a beautiful garden, he had every thing given him for his pleasure and comfort;  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/newman/parochial_and_plain_sermons_vol_viii/sermon_iii_the_trial_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Henry Newman&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Parochial and Plain Sermons, Vol. VIII</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lee/sermons_on_various_important_subjects/sermon_xxviii_the_danger_of.htm">The Danger of Deviating from Divine Institutions. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."

At the writing of this epistle he had no personal acquaintance with the church to which it is addressed.* Epaphras, a bishop of the Colossians, then his fellow prisoner at Rome, had made him acquainted with their state, and the danger  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lee/sermons_on_various_important_subjects/sermon_xxviii_the_danger_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Andrew Lee et al&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sermons on Various Important Subjects</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/palmer/a_birds-eye_view_of_the_bible/iv_and_v_the_kingdom.htm">And V the Kingdom Undivided and the Kingdom Divided</a><br></span><span class="snippet">THE HISTORICAL BOOKS: I and II Samuel.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a
