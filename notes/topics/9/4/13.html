And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. 3. And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines?  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/faithlessness_and_defeat.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/jowett/my_daily_meditation_for_the_circling_year/april_the_fourteenth_religion_as.htm">April the Fourteenth Religion as Mere Magic</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout." --1 SAMUEL iv. 1-11.

The first point is this--that the outward form of religion is to be carefully and reverently observed. But my second and most important head is this--you will notice that the very men who have the least of the spirit of religion are the most superstitiously observant of the form of it; just as you find the people here, who did not care for God, had a very superstitious regard for that chest called the ark of the covenant.

For the deciding of this, as our love will be best seen by the fruits of it, I shall lay down fourteen signs, or fruits, of love to God, and it concerns us to search carefully whether any of these fruits grow in our garden. 1. The first fruit of love is the musing of the mind upon God. He who is in love, his thoughts are ever upon the object.

David did wait as they that did watch for the morning light.
