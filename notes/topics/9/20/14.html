And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. 3. And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/jonathan_the_pattern_of_friendship.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_20_1874/a_word_for_the_persecuted.htm">A Word for the Persecuted</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Remember that this supposition is a very likely one. There are a few Christians so favourably circumstanced that all their friends accompany them in the pilgrimage to heaven. What advances they ought to make in the sacred journey! What excellent Christians they ought to be! They are like plants in a conservatory--they ought to grow and bring forth the loveliest Bowers of divine grace. But there are not very many who are altogether in that case. The large proportion of Christians find themselves opposed  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_20_1874/a_word_for_the_persecuted.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 20: 1874</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/brown/christ_the_way_the_truth_and_the_life/chapter_xv_how_to_make.htm">How to Make Use of Christ for Steadfastness, in a Time when Truth is Oppressed and Borne Down. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">When enemies are prevailing, and the way of truth is evil spoken of, many faint, and many turn aside, and do not plead for truth, nor stand up for the interest of Christ, in their hour and power of darkness: many are overcome with base fear, and either side with the workers of iniquity, or are not valiant for the truth, but being faint-hearted, turn back.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/naioth.htm">Naioth</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ramah_4.htm">Ramah</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/alive.htm">Alive</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/die.htm">Die</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/killed.htm">Killed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kind.htm">Kind</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kindness.htm">Kindness</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/love.htm">Love</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/loving.htm">Loving</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lovingkindness.htm">Lovingkindness</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/loyal.htm">Loyal</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/o.htm">O</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shew.htm">Shew</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/y/yet.htm">Yet</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-1.htm">David consults with Jonathan for his safety</a></span><br><span class="reftext">11. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-11.htm">Jonathan and David renew their covenant by oath</a></span><br><span class="reftext">18. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-18.htm">Jonathan's token to David</a></span><br><span class="reftext">23. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-23.htm">Saul, missing David, seeks to kill Jonathan</a></span><br><span class="reftext">35. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-35.htm">Jonathan affectionately takes his leave of David</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8291.htm"><b>8291</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindness</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-1.htm">1 Samuel 20:1-42</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5086.htm"><b>5086</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, <i>rise of</i></a></body></html>
