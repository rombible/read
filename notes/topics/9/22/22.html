But it is now to be proved that what is promised to God by vow or oath, ought to be performed also because of the act of Covenanting. The performance of that exercise is commanded, and the same law which enjoins that the duties  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/cunningham/the_ordinance_of_covenanting/chapter_v_covenanting_confers_obligation.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Cunningham&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Ordinance of Covenanting</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/v_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"So David fled, and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done unto him.

Driven thence by Saul's following him, and having had one last sorrowful hour of Jonathan's companionship--the last but one on earth--he fled to Nob, whither  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/v_the_exilecontinued.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of David</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/vi_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile --Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">We have one psalm which the title connects with the beginning of David's stay at Adullam,--the thirty-fourth.

You may divide the subterraneous country into three parts: the metal mines, the caves, and the places of burial. This land was eminently noted for metal mines, so that "its stones," in very many places, "were iron, and out of its hills was digged brass," Deuteronomy 8:9. From these gain accrued to the Jews: but to the Christians, not seldom slavery and misery; being frequently condemned hither by  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_99_subterraneous_places_mines.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/of_antichrist_and_his_ruin_.htm">Of Antichrist, and his Ruin: and of the Slaying the Witnesses. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">BY JOHN BUNYAN  PREFATORY REMARKS BY THE EDITOR This important treatise was prepared for the press, and left by the author, at his decease, to the care of his surviving friend for publication.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a
