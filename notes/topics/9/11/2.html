And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And He said, Unto Hebron. 2. So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, Nabal's wife, the Carmelite. 3. And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 4.

A: God's works of providence are the acts of his most holy, wise, and powerful government of his creatures, and of their actions. Of the work of God's providence Christ says, My Father worketh hitherto and I work.' John 5:17. God has rested from the works of creation, he does not create any new species of things. He rested from all his works;' Gen 2:2; and therefore it must needs be meant of his works of providence: My Father worketh and I work.'

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jabesh.htm">Jabesh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/nahash.htm">Nahash</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/bezek.htm">Bezek</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/agreement.htm">Agreement</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ammonite.htm">Ammonite</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bring.htm">Bring</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/cause.htm">Cause</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/condition.htm">Condition</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/disgrace.htm">Disgrace</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/eye.htm">Eye</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gouge.htm">Gouge</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lay.htm">Lay</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/nahash.htm">Nahash</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/picking.htm">Picking</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/replied.htm">Replied</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/reproach.htm">Reproach</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shame.htm">Shame</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thrust.htm">Thrust</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thus.htm">Thus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/treat.htm">Treat</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/treaty.htm">Treaty</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">Nahash offers them of Jabesh Gilead a reproachful condition</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm">They send messengers, and are delivered by Saul</a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-12.htm">Saul thereby is confirmed, and his kingdom renewed</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5296.htm"><b>5296</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disabilities</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5913.htm"><b>5913</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negotiation</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5947.htm"><b>5947</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shame</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5972.htm"><b>5972</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unkindness</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-2</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5592.htm"><b>5592</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treaty</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5834.htm"><b>5834</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disagreement</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-6</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5942.htm"><b>5942</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;security</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-11</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5607.htm"><b>5607</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warfare, <i>examples</i></a></body></html>
