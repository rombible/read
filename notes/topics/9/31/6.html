Beth-Shean, the Beginning of Galilee. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">The bonds of Galilee were, "on the south, Samaris and Scythopolis, unto the flood of Jordan." Scythopolis is the same with Beth-shean, of which is no seldom mention in the Holy Scriptures, Joshua 17:11; Judges 1:27; 1 Samuel 31:10. "Bethsaine (saith Josephus), called by the Greeks Scythopolis." It was distant but a little way from Jordan, seated in the entrance to a great valley: for so the same author writes, "Having passed Jordan, they came to a great plain, where lies before you the city Bethsane,"  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_60_scythopolis_beth-shean_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_2_jews_and_gentiles.htm">Jews and Gentiles in "The Land"</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Coming down from Syria, it would have been difficult to fix the exact spot where, in the view of the Rabbis, "the land" itself began. The boundary lines, though mentioned in four different documents, are not marked in anything like geographical order, but as ritual questions connected with them came up for theological discussion. For, to the Rabbis the precise limits of Palestine were chiefly interesting so far as they affected the religious obligations or privileges of a district. And in this respect  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_2_jews_and_gentiles.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sketches of Jewish Social Life</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm">Samuel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Alike from the literary and the historical point of view, the book[1] of Samuel stands midway between the book of Judges and the book of Kings. As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abinadab.htm">Abinadab</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jabesh.htm">Jabesh</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/malchishua.htm">Malchishua</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/melchishua.htm">Melchishua</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/beth-shan.htm">Beth-shan</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/mount_gilboa.htm">Mount Gilboa</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/armor.htm">Armor</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/armorbearer.htm">Armorbearer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/armor-bearer.htm">Armor-bearer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/armourbearer.htm">Armourbearer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/armour-bearer.htm">Armour-bearer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bearer.htm">Bearer</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/died.htm">Died</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/dieth.htm">Dieth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/overtook.htm">Overtook</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sons.htm">Sons</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/thus.htm">Thus</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/weapons.htm">Weapons</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">Saul, having lost his army, and his sons slain, </a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">he and his armor bearer kill themselves.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">7. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-7.htm">The Philistines possess the forsaken towns of the Israelites</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-8.htm">They triumph over the dead bodies</a></span><br><span class="reftext">11. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-11.htm">They of Jabesh Gilead recovering the dead bodies by night, </a></span><br><span class="reftext">12. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm">burn them at Jabesh, </a></span><br><span class="reftext">13. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-13.htm">and mournfully bury their bodies.</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/1652.htm"><b>1652</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers, <i>3-5</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-10</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/7236.htm"><b>7236</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, <i>united kingdom</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-13</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4254.htm"><b>4254</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountains</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4-6</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5067.htm"><b>5067</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suicide</a></body></html>
