And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over My people. 18.

To pray does not imply that without prayer God would not give us anything or that He would be unaware of our needs, but it has this great advantage, that in the attitude of prayer the soul is best fitted to receive the Giver of blessing as well as those blessings He desires to bestow. Thus it was that the fullness of the Spirit was not poured out upon the Apostles on the first day, but after ten days of special preparation.

See 1 Samuel 22:6; "Saul sat in Gibeah, under a grove in Ramah." Here the Gemarists trifle: "Whence is it (say they) that Ramah is placed near Gibea? To hint to you, that the speech of Samuel of Ramah was the cause, why Saul remained two years and a half in Gibeah."

The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abiel.htm">Abiel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/aphiah.htm">Aphiah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bechorath.htm">Bechorath</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/benjaminites.htm">Benjaminites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kish.htm">Kish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zeror.htm">Zeror</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/zuph.htm">Zuph</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ramah_4.htm">Ramah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/shaalim.htm">Shaalim</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/shalishah.htm">Shalishah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/zuph.htm">Zuph</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ago.htm">Ago</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/asses.htm">Asses</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/desirable.htm">Desirable</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/desire.htm">Desire</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/desired.htm">Desired</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/donkeys.htm">Donkeys</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/family.htm">Family</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/father's.htm">Father's</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/heart.htm">Heart</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/household.htm">Household</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lose.htm">Lose</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/lost.htm">Lost</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/mind.htm">Mind</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wandering.htm">Wandering</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/worry.htm">Worry</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">Saul despairing to find his father's donkeys</a></span><br><span class="reftext">6. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">by the counsel of his servant</a></span><br><span class="reftext">11. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-11.htm">and direction of young maidens</a></span><br><span class="reftext">15. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-15.htm">according to God's revelation</a></span><br><span class="reftext">18. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm">comes to Samuel</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-19.htm">Samuel entertains Saul at the feast</a></span><br><span class="reftext">25. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-25.htm">Samuel, after secret communication, brings Saul on his way</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-11.htm">1 Samuel 9:11-24</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4476.htm"><b>4476</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meals</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-15.htm">1 Samuel 9:15-20</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8129.htm"><b>8129</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guidance, <i>examples</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-19.htm">1 Samuel 9:19-21</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8308.htm"><b>8308</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modesty</a></body></html>
