It may be also, that from the Angels, who are present in the things which are doing here, the dead do hear somewhat,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/augustine/on_care_to_be_had_for_the_dead_/18_so_then_we_must.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">St. Augustine&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">On Care to Be Had for the Dead. </span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_divine_cordial/an_exhortation_to_love_god.htm">An Exhortation to Love God</a><br></span><span class="snippet">1. An exhortation. Let me earnestly persuade all who bear the name of Christians to become lovers of God. "O love the Lord, all ye his saints" (Psalm xxxi. 23). There are but few that love God: many give Him hypocritical kisses, but few love Him. It is not so easy to love God as most imagine. The affection of love is natural, but the grace is not. Men are by nature haters of God (Rom. i. 30). The wicked would flee from God; they would neither be under His rules, nor within His reach. They fear God,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/a_divine_cordial/an_exhortation_to_love_god.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Thomas Watson&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Divine Cordial</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watson/the_beatitudes_an_exposition_of_matthew_51-12/2_there_is_a_blessedness.htm">There is a Blessedness in Reversion</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Blessed are the poor in spirit. Matthew 5:3 Having done with the occasion, I come now to the sermon itself. Blessed are the poor in spirit'. Christ does not begin his Sermon on the Mount as the Law was delivered on the mount, with commands and threatenings, the trumpet sounding, the fire flaming, the earth quaking, and the hearts of the Israelites too for fear; but our Saviour (whose lips dropped as the honeycomb') begins with promises and blessings.

Man being by his fall plunged into a labyrinth of misery, and having no way left to recover himself, God was pleased to enter into a new covenant with him, and to restore him to life by a Redeemer.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/amalek.htm">Amalek</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/amalek.htm">Amalek</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/en-dor.htm">En-dor</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gath.htm">Gath</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gilboa.htm">Gilboa</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ramah_4.htm">Ramah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/shunem.htm">Shunem</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/affrighted.htm">Affrighted</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/behold.htm">Behold</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/bondmaid.htm">Bondmaid</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/danger.htm">Danger</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/ear.htm">Ear</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/greatly.htm">Greatly</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/handmaid.htm">Handmaid</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hands.htm">Hands</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hast.htm">Hast</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/hearkened.htm">Hearkened</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/l/listened.htm">Listened</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/maidservant.htm">Maidservant</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/maid-servant.htm">Maid-servant</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/obey.htm">Obey</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/o/obeyed.htm">Obeyed</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/shaken.htm">Shaken</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sore.htm">Sore</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/soul.htm">Soul</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spakest.htm">Spakest</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/speak.htm">Speak</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spoke.htm">Spoke</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spoken.htm">Spoken</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/spokest.htm">Spokest</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/terrified.htm">Terrified</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/trouble.htm">Trouble</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/troubled.htm">Troubled</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/v/voice.htm">Voice</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-1.htm">Achish puts confidence in David</a></span><br><span class="reftext">3. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm">Saul having destroyed the witches</a></span><br><span class="reftext">4. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-4.htm">and now in his fear forsaken of God</a></span><br><span class="reftext">7. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">has recourse to a witch</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-8.htm">who, encouraged by Saul, raises up Samuel</a></span><br><span class="reftext">15. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">Saul hearing his ruin, faints</a></span><br><span class="reftext">21. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm">The woman and his servants refresh him with meat</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5156.htm"><b>5156</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21-25</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4478.htm"><b>4478</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/4530.htm"><b>4530</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unleavened bread</a></body></html>
