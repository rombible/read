These are--his early years up to his escape from the court of Saul, his exile, the prosperous beginning of his reign, his sin and penitence, his flight before Absalom's rebellion, and the darkened end. We have but faint incidental traces of his life up to his anointing by Samuel, with which the narrative in the historical books opens. But perhaps the fact that the story  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/ii_early_days.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of David</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/viii_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile --Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">As our purpose in this volume is not a complete biography, it will not be necessary to dwell on the subsequent portions of the exile, inasmuch as there is little reference to these in the psalms. We must pass over even that exquisite episode of Abigail, whose graceful presence and "most subtle flow of silver-paced counsel" soothed David's ruffled spirit, and led him captive at once as in a silken leash.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahinoam.htm">Ahinoam</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/carmelitess.htm">Carmelitess</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gerzites.htm">Gerzites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/geshurites.htm">Geshurites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gezrites.htm">Gezrites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/girzites.htm">Girzites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/gizrites.htm">Gizrites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jerahmeel.htm">Jerahmeel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jerahmeelites.htm">Jerahmeelites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jezreel.htm">Jezreel</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jezreelitess.htm">Jezreelitess</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jizreelitess.htm">Jizreelitess</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kenites.htm">Kenites</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/maoch.htm">Maoch</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/n/nabal.htm">Nabal</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/carmel.htm">Carmel</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/egypt.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gath.htm">Gath</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/hebron.htm">Hebron</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/negeb.htm">Negeb</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/shur_desert.htm">Shur Desert</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ziph.htm">Ziph</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/a'chish.htm">A'chish</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/belonged.htm">Belonged</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/belongeth.htm">Belongeth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/b/belongs.htm">Belongs</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/giveth.htm">Giveth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/k/kings.htm">Kings</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pertaineth.htm">Pertaineth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/pertains.htm">Pertains</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/property.htm">Property</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/r/reason.htm">Reason</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/straight.htm">Straight</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/till.htm">Till</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/w/wherefore.htm">Wherefore</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">Saul, hearing David to be in Gath, seeks no more for him</a></span><br><span class="reftext">5. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-5.htm">David begs Ziklag of Achish</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm">He, invading other countries, persuades Achish he fought against Judah.</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1-6</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5086.htm"><b>5086</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, <i>rise of</i></a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1-12</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/8830.htm"><b>8830</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspicion</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5-11</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5088.htm"><b>5088</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, <i>character</i></a></body></html>
