No words are more fitting on this Centennial day.  One hundred years ago George Washington was inaugurated the first President of the United States.  Words are powerless to express the grateful thoughts which swell patriot hearts.

And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. 3.
