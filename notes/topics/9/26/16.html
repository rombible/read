Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. 7. So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/love_and_remorse.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maspero/history_of_egypt_chaldaea_syria_babylonia_and_assyria_v_4/chapter_ithe_first_chaldaean_empire.htm">The First Chaldaean Empire and the Hyksos in Egypt</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Syria: the part played by it in the ancient world--Babylon and the first Chaldaean empire--The dominion of the Hyksos: Ahmosis.
