Then Samuel answered, Speak; for Thy servant heareth."--1 Samuel iii. 10.  In the narrative of which these words form part, we have a remarkable instance of a Divine call, and the manner in which it is our duty to meet it.  Samuel was from a child brought to the house of the Lord; and in due time he was called to a sacred office, and made a prophet.  He was called, and he forthwith answered the call.

God had not cast him off; but he viewed him with such displeasure that he would only speak to him through another person: even as great kings, if they are offended with their courtiers, send them messages by other hands.

There was no doubt about the baby's name. He was called "Samuel," which means "God has heard."
