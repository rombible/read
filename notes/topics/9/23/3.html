And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. 3. And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/jonathan_the_pattern_of_friendship.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/vi_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile --Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">We have one psalm which the title connects with the beginning of David's stay at Adullam,--the thirty-fourth.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings.
