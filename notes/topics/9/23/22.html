And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. 3. And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/jonathan_the_pattern_of_friendship.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/the_life_of_david/vi_the_exilecontinued.htm">The Exile --Continued. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">We have one psalm which the title connects with the beginning of David's stay at Adullam,--the thirty-fourth.

As we have already seen, the Deuteronomic book of Judges in all probability ran into Samuel and ended in ch. xii.; while the story of David, begun in Samuel, embraces the first two chapters of the first book of Kings. The book of Samuel is not very happily named, as much of it is devoted to Saul and the greater part to David; yet it is not altogether inappropriate,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/samuel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><div class="vheading">People</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/abiathar.htm">Abiathar</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/a/ahimelech.htm">Ahimelech</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/m/maon.htm">Maon</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/z/ziphites.htm">Ziphites</a><div class="vheading2">Places</div><a href="http://bibleatlas.org/arabah.htm">Arabah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/engedi.htm">Engedi</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/hachilah.htm">Hachilah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/horesh.htm">Horesh</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/jeshimon.htm">Jeshimon</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/keilah.htm">Keilah</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/maon.htm">Maon</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/rock_of_escape.htm">Rock of Escape</a>, <a href="http://bibleatlas.org/ziph.htm">Ziph</a><div class="vheading2">Topics</div><span class="conc"><a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/crafty.htm">Crafty</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/c/cunning.htm">Cunning</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/david.htm">David</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/dealeth.htm">Dealeth</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/deals.htm">Deals</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/d/deceit.htm">Deceit</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/e/expert.htm">Expert</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/f/foot.htm">Foot</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/g/goes.htm">Goes</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/h/haunt.htm">Haunt</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/i/investigate.htm">Investigate</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/please.htm">Please</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/preparation.htm">Preparation</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/prepare.htm">Prepare</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/steps.htm">Steps</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/subtile.htm">Subtile</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/subtilly.htm">Subtilly</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/subtly.htm">Subtly</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/s/sure.htm">Sure</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/track.htm">Track</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/u/usually.htm">Usually</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/y/yet.htm">Yet</a></span><div class="vheading2">Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-1.htm">David, enquiring of the Lord by Abiathar, rescues Keilah</a></span><br><span class="reftext">7. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-7.htm">God showing him the coming of Saul, and the treachery of the Keilites, </a></span><br><span class="reftext">13. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm">he escapes from Keilah</a></span><br><span class="reftext">14. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-14.htm">In Ziph Jonathan comes and comforts him</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm">The Ziphites discover him to Saul</a></span><br><span class="reftext">25. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-25.htm">At Maon he is rescued from Saul by the invasion of the Philistines</a></span><br><span class="reftext">29. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-29.htm">He dwells at En Gedi</a></span><br></div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Dictionary of Bible Themes</div><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19-23</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5817.htm"><b>5817</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conspiracies</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-21.htm">1 Samuel 23:21-23</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/7266.htm"><b>7266</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tribes of Israel</a><p><b><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22-23</a></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/dbt/5948.htm"><b>5948</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shrewdness</a></body></html>
