Make no provision for the flesh; give no recognition to your lower life. Say "No" to everything earthly and selfish. How very much of the life of faith consists in simply denying ourselves. We begin with one great "Yes," to God, and then we conclude with an eternal "No," to ourselves, the world, the flesh and the  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/october_19_denying_ungodliness_titus.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.

For it is written (Rom. 12:3): "Not to be more wise than it behooveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety." Therefore sobriety is also about wisdom, and not only about drink. Objection 2: Further, concerning the wisdom of God, it is written (Wis. 8:7) that "she teacheth sobriety [Douay: 'temperance'], and prudence, and justice, and fortitude," where sobriety stands for temperance. Now temperance is not only about drink,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_drink_is_the_matter.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_priests_alone_have_the.htm">Whether Priests Alone have the Keys?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that not only priests have the keys. For Isidore says (Etym. vii, 12) that the "doorkeepers have to tell the good from the bad, so as to admit the good and keep out the bad." Now this is the definition of the keys, as appears from what has been said ([4874]Q[17], A[2]). Therefore not only priests but even doorkeepers have the keys. Objection 2: Further, the keys are conferred on priests when by being anointed they receive power from God. But kings of Christian peoples also  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_priests_alone_have_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_one_who_is_under.htm">Whether one who is under Another's Power Can Give Alms?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that one who is under another's power can give alms. For religious are under the power of their prelates to whom they have vowed obedience. Now if it were unlawful for them to give alms, they would lose by entering the state of religion, for as Ambrose [*The quotation is from the works of Ambrosiaster. Cf.

Because fulfilment should correspond to promise. Now, the promise of Christ's coming is thus expressed (Ps. 49:3): "God shall come manifestly. But He came by His birth in the flesh." Therefore it seems that His birth should have been made known to the whole world. Objection 2: Further, it is written (1 Tim. 1:15): "Christ came into this world to save sinners."

For by Orders a man is ordained to the dispensation of the sacraments. But the sacraments can be administered by good and wicked. Therefore goodness of life is not requisite. Objection 2: Further, the service of God in the sacraments is no greater than service offered to Him in the body. Now our Lord did not cast aside the sinful and notorious woman from rendering Him a bodily service (Lk. 7).

For old age gives a man a certain standing; wherefore honor and reverence are due to the old, according to Lev. 19:32, "Rise up before the hoary head, and honor the person of the aged man." Now the Apostle declares that old men especially should be exhorted to sobriety, according to Titus 2:2, "That the aged man be sober." Therefore sobriety is most requisite in persons of standing.
