It abounds in poetical gems of the purest ray. It breathes the bracing air of the hill country, and the passionate love of man for woman and woman for man. It is a revelation of the keen Hebrew delight in nature, in her vineyards and pastures, flowers and fruit trees, in her doves and deer and sheep and goats. It is a song tremulous from  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/song_of_songs.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Edgar McFadyen&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Introduction to the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/flavel/christ_altogether_lovely/christ_is_to_be_loved.htm">Christ is to be Loved</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"Yes, He is altogether lovely." Song of Songs 5:16. At the ninth verse of this chapter, you have a question put forth by the daughters of Jerusalem, "What is your beloved more than another beloved?" The spouse answers, "He is the chief among ten thousand." She then recounts many of the things she finds so excellent in her beloved and then concludes with these words that I have read: "Yes, he is altogether lovely." The words set forth the transcendent loveliness of the Lord Jesus Christ, and naturally  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/flavel/christ_altogether_lovely/christ_is_to_be_loved.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Flavel&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christ Altogether Lovely</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/watts/the_psalms_and_hymns_of_isaac_watts/hymn_75_the_description_of.htm">The Description of Christ the Beloved.

First, It excludes all unloveliness and disagreeableness from Jesus Christ. As a theologian long ago said, "There is nothing in him which is not loveable." The excellencies of Jesus Christ are perfectly exclusive of all their opposites; there is nothing of a contrary property or quality found in him to contaminate or devaluate his excellency.
