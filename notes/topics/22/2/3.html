It abounds in poetical gems of the purest ray. It breathes the bracing air of the hill country, and the passionate love of man for woman and woman for man. It is a revelation of the keen Hebrew delight in nature, in her vineyards and pastures, flowers and fruit trees, in her doves and deer and sheep and goats.

Then I arise and search the street, Till I my Lord, my Savior meet: I ask the watchmen of the night, "Where did you see my soul's delight?"  Sometimes I find him in my way, Directed by a heav'nly ray; I leap for joy to see his face, And hold him fast in mine embrace.
