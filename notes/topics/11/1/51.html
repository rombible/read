Even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. 31.

ALFRED ROWLAND, D.D., LL.B.  It is notorious that the sons of devout men sometimes prove a curse to their parents, and bring dishonour on the cause of God.  When Eve rejoiced over her first-born, she little suspected that passions were sleeping within him which would impel him to slay his own brother; and the experience of the first mother has been repeated, though in different forms, in all lands and in all ages.  Isaac's heart was rent by the deceit of Jacob, and by the self-will of Esau.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/adonijah.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">George Milligan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Men of the Bible; Some Lesser-Known</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_prayer_should_be_vocal.htm">Whether Prayer Should be Vocal?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that prayer ought not to be vocal. As stated above [3025](A[4]), prayer is addressed chiefly to God. Now God knows the language of the heart. Therefore it is useless to employ vocal prayer. Objection 2: Further, prayer should lift man's mind to God, as stated above (A[1], ad 2). But words, like other sensible objects, prevent man from ascending to God by contemplation. Therefore we should not use words in our prayers.

During this period Ishbosheth, son of Saul, reigned over Israel in the North. It is probable that both of these kings were regarded as vassals of the Philistines and paid tribute. On account of rival leaders, there was constant warfare between these two rival kings.
