And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it."--1 Kings 20:40. There is a very striking incident connected with this text.  The great battle is raging, a certain important prisoner has been taken, and if you read between the lines you seem to know that upon him depend many of the issues of war.  His skill in leading the enemy had been marvelous, his courage in the thick of the fight striking;  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/chapman/and_judas_iscariot/the_lost_opportunity.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">J.

Ahab, King of Israel, was but a poor creature, and, like most weak characters, he turned out a wicked one, because he found that there were more temptations to do wrong than inducements to do right. Like other weak people, too, he was torn asunder by the influence of stronger wills.
