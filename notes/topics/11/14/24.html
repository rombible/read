There alone in the Sacred History the gulf between Biblical and Ecclesiastical miracles almost disappears."[5] It required some courage to say as much as this then, while the storm of persecution was raging against Bishop Colenso for his critical work on the Pentateuch.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/whiton/miracles_and_supernatural_religion/i_synopsis_the_gradual_narrowing_of.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">James Morris Whiton&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Miracles and Supernatural Religion</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a><br></span><span class="snippet">BY REV. ALFRED ROWLAND, D.D., LL.B.  "Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin."--1 KINGS xiv. 16.  Jeroboam's character is worthy of serious study, not only because it influenced the destiny of God's ancient people, but because it suggests lessons of the utmost value to His people still.  He may be fairly regarded as a type of those who are successful men of the world.  He was not an example of piety, for he had none--nor of lofty principle, for he was an opportunist who made expediency  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/jeroboam.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">George Milligan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Men of the Bible; Some Lesser-Known</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_contention_is_a_mortal.htm">Whether Contention is a Mortal Sin?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that contention is not a mortal sin. For there is no mortal sin in spiritual men: and yet contention is to be found in them, according to Lk. 22:24: "And there was also a strife amongst" the disciples of Jesus, "which of them should . . . be the greatest." Therefore contention is not a mortal sin. Objection 2: Further, no well disposed man should be pleased that his neighbor commit a mortal sin. But the Apostle says (Phil. 1:17): "Some out of contention preach Christ,"  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_contention_is_a_mortal.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_divination_by_drawing_lots.htm">Whether Divination by Drawing Lots is Unlawful?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that divination by drawing lots is not unlawful, because a gloss of Augustine on Ps. 30:16, "My lots are in Thy hands," says: "It is not wrong to cast lots, for it is a means of ascertaining the divine will when a man is in doubt." Objection 2: There is, seemingly, nothing unlawful in the observances which the Scriptures relate as being practiced by holy men. Now both in the Old and in the New Testament we find holy men practicing the casting of lots.

The prayerful and believing acceptance of the words will waken the assurance that such wholehearted love and service is exactly the blessing the New Covenant was meant to make possible.

We have shown that the will of the natural man is neither Sovereign nor free but, instead, a servant and slave. We have argued that a right conception of the sinner's will-its servitude-is essential to a just estimate of his depravity and ruin.

The position which has been assigned to Joel in the collection of the Minor Prophets, furnishes an external argument for the determination of the time at which Joel wrote. There cannot be any doubt that the Collectors were guided by a consideration of the chronology. The circumstance, that they placed the prophecies of Joel just between the two prophets who, according to the inscriptions and contents of their prophecies, belonged to the time of Jeroboam and Uzziah, is  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/hengstenberg/christology_of_the_old_testament/the_prophet_joel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Christology of the Old Testament</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/mcfadyen/introduction_to_the_old_testament/kings.htm">Kings</a><br></span><span class="snippet">The book[1] of Kings is strikingly unlike any modern historical narrative.
