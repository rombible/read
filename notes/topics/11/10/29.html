The beautiful history recorded in the chapter from which the above words are quoted is deeply instructive to those who have learned to recognise CHRIST in the Scriptures. The reference to this narrative by our LORD Himself was surely designed to draw our attention to it, and gives it an added interest.

But as we fail to discover here any religious motive, we can only account for it on the score of altered political and social circumstances. So long as the people were, at least nominally, independent, and in possession of their own land, constant engagement in a trade would probably mark an inferior social stage, and imply  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/edersheim/sketches_of_jewish_social_life/chapter_12_commerce.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alfred Edersheim&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Sketches of Jewish Social Life</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/pink/the_redeemers_return/4_the_fact_of_the.htm">The Fact of the Redeemer's Return was Typified in the Lives of Joseph and Solomon. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">In the Old Testament there are numerous references to the Second Coming of Christ, references both direct and typical, but in every instance it was His return to the earth which was in view.

It covers a period of no less than four centuries.
