One at the shore of the Mediterranean sea: that was first called Gezer, 1 Kings 9:15. In Josephus, "Simon destroyed the city Gazara, and Joppe, and Jamnia."--And in the Book of the Maccabees, "And he fortified Joppe, which is on the sea, and Gazara, which is on the borders of Azotus." At length, according to the idiom of the Syrian dialect, Zain passed into Daleth; and instead of Gazara, it was called Gadara. Hence Strabo, after the mention of Jamnia, saith, "and there  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lightfoot/from_the_talmud_and_hebraica/chapter_75_gadara.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">John Lightfoot&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">From the Talmud and Hebraica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/hiram_the_inspired_artificer.htm">Hiram, the Inspired Artificer</a><br></span><span class="snippet">BY REV. W. J. TOWNSEND, D.D.  The Temple of Solomon was the crown of art in the old world.  There were temples on a larger scale, and of more massive construction, but the enormous masses of masonry of the oldest nations were not comparable with the artistic grace, the luxurious adornments, and the harmonious proportions of this glorious House of God.  David had laid up money and material for the great work, but he was not permitted to carry it out. He was a man of war, and blood-stained hands were  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/milligan/men_of_the_bible_some_lesser-known/hiram_the_inspired_artificer.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">George Milligan&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Men of the Bible; Some Lesser-Known</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_any_preparation_and_disposition.htm">Whether any Preparation and Disposition for Grace is Required on Man's Part?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would seem that no preparation or disposition for grace is required on man's part, since, as the Apostle says (Rom. 4:4), "To him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt." Now a man's preparation by free-will can only be through some operation. Hence it would do away with the notion of grace. Objection 2: Further, whoever is going on sinning, is not preparing himself to have grace. But to some who are going on sinning grace is given, as is  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_any_preparation_and_disposition.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Summa Theologica</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/bunyan/the_works_of_john_bunyan_volumes_1-3/a_discourse.htm">A Discourse of the House and Forest of Lebanon</a><br></span><span class="snippet">OF THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON.  ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR. That part of Palestine in which the celebrated mountains of Lebanon are situated, is the border country adjoining Syria, having Sidon for its seaport, and Land, nearly adjoining the city of Damascus, on the north. This metropolitan city of Syria, and capital of the kingdom of Damascus, was strongly fortified; and during the border conflicts it served as a cover to the Assyrian army.

Its comparative brevity, its curious perspective, and-with some brilliant exceptions--its relative monotony, are obvious to the most cursory perusal, and to understand these things is, in large measure, to understand the book. It covers a period of no less than four centuries. Beginning with the death of David and the accession of Solomon (1 Kings i., ii.) it traverses his reign with considerable fulness (1 Kings iii.-xi.),  <a
