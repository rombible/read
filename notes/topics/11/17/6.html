As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand.--1 KINGS xvii. 1.  This solemn and remarkable adjuration seems to have been habitual upon Elijah's lips in the great crises of his life. We never find it used by any but himself, and his scholar and successor, Elisha. Both of them employ it under similar circumstances, as if unveiling the very secret of their lives, the reason for their strength, and for their undaunted bearing and bold fronting of all antagonism.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_f/elijah_standing_before_the_lord.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_6_1860/the_inexhaustible_barrel.htm">The Inexhaustible Barrel</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Though, however, I make these few observations by way of preface, this is not the subject of this morning. I propose to take the case of the poor widow of Sarepta as an illustration of divine love, as it manifests itself to man; and I shall have three things for you to notice. First, the object of divine love; secondly, the singular methods of divine love; and, then, in the third place, the undying faithfulness of divine love--"The barrel of meal did not waste, neither did the cruse of oil fail,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_6_1860/the_inexhaustible_barrel.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 6: 1860</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/champness/broken_bread/xxxiii_answered_prayer.htm">Answered Prayer. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah."--1 KINGS xvii. 22. Yes, and He will hear your voice if you are as much in earnest as he was! Why should not God hear the voice of William, or Robert, Sarah or Edith? He is no respecter of persons.  Is it not written over the door of mercy, "Knock, and it shall be opened?"  Aye, and the knocker is so low a child's hand may reach it.  St. James tells us that Elijah was "a man of like passions."

The argument of the letter is, that the story of Lazarus's being raised is an imposture; or else the Jews could not have been so wicked, as to be on that account provoked against  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lardner/a_vindication_of_three_of_our_blessed_saviours_miracles/answer_to_the_jewish_rabbys.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Nathaniel Lardner&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Vindication of Three of Our Blessed Saviour's Miracles</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/aquinas/summa_theologica/whether_it_is_praiseworthy_to.htm">Whether it is Praiseworthy to Enter Religion Without Taking Counsel of Many, and Previously Deliberating for a Long Time?</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Objection 1: It would not seem praiseworthy to enter religion without taking counsel of many, and previously deliberating for a long time. For it is written (1 Jn. 4:1): "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God." Now sometimes a man's purpose of entering religion is not of God, since it often comes to naught through his leaving the religious life; for it is written (Acts 5:38,39): "If this counsel or this work be of God, you cannot overthrow it."

Objection 2: There is, seemingly, nothing unlawful in the observances which the Scriptures relate as being practiced by holy men. Now both in the Old and in the New Testament we find holy men practicing the casting of lots.

For the sake of argument, let us say that God created the world, designed and fixed certain laws (which men term "the laws of Nature"), and that He then withdrew, leaving the world to its fortune and the out-working of these laws.

Its comparative brevity, its curious perspective, and-with some brilliant exceptions--its relative monotony, are obvious to the most cursory perusal, and to understand these things is, in large measure, to understand the book. It covers a period of no less than four centuries. Beginning with the death of David and the accession of Solomon (1 Kings i., ii.) it traverses his reign with considerable fulness (1 Kings iii.-xi.),  <a
