The Lord be with you all.'--2 THESS. iii. 16.  We have reached here the last of the brief outbursts of prayer which characterise this letter, and bear witness to the Apostle's affection for his Thessalonian converts. It is the deepening of the ordinary Jewish formula of meeting and parting. We find that, in most of his letters, the Apostle begins with wishing 'grace and peace,' and closes with an echo of the wish.

They are probably the earliest of the Apostle's writings, and the frequency of his prayers is a significant testimony to his thought for his converts and their needs. Hardly less striking is the variety of the prayers,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/thomas/the_prayers_of_st_paul/iv_love_and_peace.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">W.
