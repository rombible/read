Them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.'--2 Peter i. 1.  Peter seems to have had a liking for that word 'precious.' It is not a very descriptive one; it does not give much light as to the quality of the things to which it is applied; but it is a suggestion of one-idea value. It is interesting to notice the objects to which, in his two letters--for I take this to be his letter--he applies it.

It seems to me very like Peter that there should be so much in this letter about the very commonplace and familiar excellence of diligence.
