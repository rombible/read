Matthew vi. 34.  "Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall  take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient unto the day is the  evil thereof." Scholars will tell you that the words "take no thought" do not exactly  express our Lord's meaning in this text.  That they should rather stand,  "Be not anxious about to-morrow."  And doubtless they are right on the  whole.  But the truth is, that we have no word in English which exactly  expresses the Greek word which St Matthew  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/all_saints_day_and_other_sermons/sermon_xxxix_the_distracted_mind.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Kingsley&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">All Saints' Day and Other Sermons</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kingsley/all_saints_day_and_other_sermons/sermon_xxxviii_the_lords_prayer.htm">The Lord's Prayer</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Windsor Castle, 1867.

It makes all the difference whether the thought of the name, or that of the will, of God be the prominent one. If men begin with the will, then their religion will be slavish, a dull, sullen resignation, or a painful, weary round of unwelcome duties and reluctant abstainings.

The sequence of the petitions in the second half of the Lord's Prayer suggests that every man who needs to pray for daily bread needs also to pray for daily forgiveness. The supplication for the supply of our bodily needs precedes the others, because it deals with a need which is fundamental indeed, but of less importance than those which prompt the subsequent petitions.
