Our thoughts are, rightly, so absorbed by the central Figure in this great chapter that we pass by almost unnoticed the groups round the cross. And yet there are large lessons to be learned from each of them. These rude soldiers, four in number, as we infer from John's Gospel, had no doubt joined with their comrades in the coarse mockery which preceded the sad procession to Calvary; and then they had to do the rough work of the executioners,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_b/the_blind_watchers_at_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Expositions of Holy Scripture</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/expositions_of_holy_scripture_b/the_veil_rent.htm">The Veil Rent</a><br></span><span class="snippet">'Behold, the veil of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.'--MATT. xxvii. 51.
