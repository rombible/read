To preach the Gospel in Rome had long been the goal of Paul's hopes. He wished to do in the centre of power what he had done in Athens, the home of wisdom; and with superb confidence, not in himself, but in his message, to try conclusions with the strongest thing in the world. He knew its power well, and was not appalled.

It is a great mistake to treat Paul's writings, and especially this Epistle, as mere theology. They are the transcript of his life's experience. As has been well said, the gospel of Paul is an interpretation of the significance of the life and work of Jesus based upon the revelation to him of Jesus as the risen Christ. He believed that he had seen Jesus on the road to Damascus, and it was that appearance  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/romans_corinthians_to_ii_corinthians_chap_v/the_witness_of_the_resurrection.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Romans, Corinthians (To II Corinthians, Chap.

This is the address of the Epistle. The first thing to be noticed about it, by way of introduction, is the universality of this designation of Christians. Paul had never been in Rome, and knew very little about the religious stature of the converts there. But he has no hesitation in declaring that they are all 'beloved of God' and 'saints.'

In the opening of the most logical and systematic treatise in the New Testament, the Epistle to the Romans, the apostle Paul enters upon a line of argument to demonstrate the ill-desert of every human creature without exception. In order to this, he shows that no excuse can be urged upon the ground of moral ignorance. He explicitly teaches that the pagan knows that there is one Supreme  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/shedd/sermons_to_the_natural_man/sin_in_the_heart_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">William G.T.

The idea of God is the most important and comprehensive of all the ideas of which the human mind is possessed. It is the foundation of religion; of all right doctrine, and all right conduct. A correct intuition of it leads to correct religious theories and practice; while any erroneous or defective view of the Supreme Being will pervade the whole province of religion, and exert a most pernicious influence upon the entire character  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/shedd/sermons_to_the_natural_man/all_mankind_guilty_or_every.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">William G.T.

This first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans is a dreadful portion of the Word of God. I should hardly like to read it all through aloud; it is not intended to be so used. Read it at home, and be startled at the awful vices of the Gentile world. Unmentionable crimes were the common pleasures of those wicked ages; but the chapter is also a striking picture of heathenism  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_38_1892/inexcusable_irreverence_and_ingratitude.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Charles Haddon Spurgeon&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Spurgeon's Sermons Volume 38: 1892</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/spurgeon/spurgeons_sermons_volume_39_1893/the_beloved_pastors_plea_for.htm">The Beloved Pastor's Plea for Unity</a><br></span><span class="snippet">"To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."--Romans 1:7.

The earliest existing record of events in the life of Jesus is given to us in the epistles of Paul. His account of the appearances of the Lord after his death and resurrection (I. Cor. xv. 3-8) was written within thirty years of these events. The date of the testimony, however, is much earlier, since Paul refers to the experience which transformed his own life, and so carries us back to within a few years of the crucifixion. Other facts from Jesus' life may be gathered from Paul, as his descent  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/rhees/the_life_of_jesus_of_nazareth/ii_sources_of_our_knowledge.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rush Rhees&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Life of Jesus of Nazareth</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xxiii_the_holy_spirit_in.htm">The Holy Spirit in the Glorified Christ. </a><br></span><span class="snippet">"Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead."--Rom. i. 4. From the foregoing studies it appears that the Holy Spirit performed a work in the human nature of Christ as He descended the several steps of His humiliation to the death of the cross. The question now arises, whether He had also a work in the several steps of Christ's exaltation to the excellent glory, i.e., in His resurrection, ascension, royal dignity, and second coming.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/kuyper/the_work_of_the_holy_spirit/xxiii_the_holy_spirit_in.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Abraham Kuyper&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/clarke/a_discourse_concerning_the_being_and_attributes_of_god/v_proposition_v_though_the.htm">Proposition Though the Necessity and Indispensableness of all the Great and Moral Obligations of Natural Religion,</a><br></span><span class="snippet">and also the certainty of a future state of rewards and punishments, be thus in general deducible, even demonstrably, by a chain of clear and undeniable reasoning; yet (in the present state of the world, by what means soever it came originally to be so corrupted, the particular circumstances whereof could not now be certainly known but by revelation,) such is the carelessness, inconsiderateness, and want of attention of the greater part of mankind; so many the prejudices and false notions taken up  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/clarke/a_discourse_concerning_the_being_and_attributes_of_god/v_proposition_v_though_the.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Samuel Clarke&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">A Discourse Concerning the Being and Attributes of God</span><p><span class="headingtext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/library/lake/landmarks_in_the_history_of_early_christianity/v_rome_and_ephesus.htm">Rome and Ephesus</a><br></span><span class="snippet">Corinth as portrayed in the Epistles of Paul gives us our simplest and least contaminated picture of the Hellenic Christianity which regarded itself as the cult of the Lord Jesus, who offered salvation--immortality--to those initiated in his mysteries.
