Precious souls sometimes fight tremendous battles in order to attain to righteousness in trying places. Perhaps the heart has become wrong in some matter where temptation has been allowed to overcome, or at least to turn it aside from its singleness unto God; and the conflict is a terrible one as it seeks to adjust itself and be right with God, and finds itself baffled by its own spiritual foes,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/march_20_they_which_receive.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
