The Word of God creates what it commands. When Christ says to any of us "Now are ye clean through the word which I have spoken unto you," We are clean. When He says "no condemnation" there is none, though there has been a lifetime of sin before. And when He says, "mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds," then the weak are strong. This is the part of faith, to take God at His Word, and then expect Him to make it real.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/simpson/days_of_heaven_upon_earth_/september_24_he_calleth_things.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Rev.
