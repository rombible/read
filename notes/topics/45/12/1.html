In the former part of this letter the Apostle has been building up a massive fabric of doctrine, which has stood the waste of centuries, and the assaults of enemies, and has been the home of devout souls. He now passes to speak of practice, and he binds the two halves of his letter indissolubly together by that significant  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/romans_corinthians_to_ii_corinthians_chap_v/the_sacrifice_of_the_body.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Romans, Corinthians (To II Corinthians, Chap.

Paul believed that Christian doctrine was meant to influence Christian practice; and therefore, after the fundamental and profound exhibition of the central truths of Christianity which occupies the earlier portion of this great Epistle, he tacks on, with a 'therefore' to his theological exposition, a series of plain, practical teachings. The place where conduct comes in the letter is profoundly significant, and, if  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/romans_corinthians_to_ii_corinthians_chap_v/a_triplet_of_graces.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Romans, Corinthians (To II Corinthians, Chap.

These three closely connected clauses occur, as you all know, in the midst of that outline of the Christian life with which the Apostle begins the practical part of this Epistle. Now, what he omits in this sketch of Christian duty seems to me quite as significant as what he inserts. It is very remarkable that in the twenty verses devoted to this subject, this is the only one which refers to the inner secrets  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/romans_corinthians_to_ii_corinthians_chap_v/another_triplet_of_graces.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Romans, Corinthians (To II Corinthians, Chap.

In the two former the same verb is employed: and in the third the word for 'wise' is cognate with  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/maclaren/romans_corinthians_to_ii_corinthians_chap_v/still_another_triplet_2.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">Alexander Maclaren&#8212;</span><span class="citation2">Romans, Corinthians (To II Corinthians, Chap.
