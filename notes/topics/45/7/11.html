Romans vii. 22-25.  "I delight in the law of God after the inward man:   but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,  and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.   O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this  death?  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." This is the first Sunday in Advent.

Hence, the writer of this Epistle endeavors with special effort to make the Hebrews feel the weakness of their old and much esteemed religion,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/library/shedd/sermons_to_the_natural_man/the_impotence_of_the_law.htm" title="continued">&#8230;</a><br></span><span class="citation">William G.T.

This theory does not deny that the sinner is unholy, nor that he ought to be holy. It says two things: (1) that there is no holiness in the sinner; but--and this indicates the real character of sin--(2) that there ought to be holiness in him.
