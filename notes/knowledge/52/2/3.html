God is our witness! . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1, 2</a><br />Finally, brothers, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to live in a way that is pleasing to God, as you have received from us. This is how you already live, so you should do so all the more. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a><br />Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a><br />Here I am. Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed: Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I wronged or oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes? Tell me, and I will restore it to you.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33, 34</a><br />I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a><br />For we are not like so many others, who peddle the word of God for profit.
