They make no distinction between the holy and the common, and they fail to distinguish between the clean and the unclean. They disregard My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13, 21, 24</a><br />Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness.

Then I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and put an end to them in the wilderness. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-38.htm">Ezekiel 23:38, 39</a><br />They have also done to Me this: On that very same day they defiled My sanctuary and profaned My Sabbaths. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-30.htm">Leviticus 19:30</a><br />You must keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary.
