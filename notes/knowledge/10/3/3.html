She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in his dealings. . . . </p><p class="hdg">Absalom</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-20.htm">2 Samuel 13:20-28</a><br />Her brother Absalom said to her: "Has your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart." So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in the house of her brother Absalom. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24-33</a><br />But the king added, "He may return to his house, but he must not see my face." So Absalom returned to his own house, but he did not see the king. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-18</a><br />Some time later, Absalom provided for himself a chariot with horses and fifty men to run before him. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-14</a><br />Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9-18, 33</a><br />Now Absalom was riding on his mule when he met the servants of David, and as the mule went under the tangled branches of a large oak, Absalom's head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so that he was suspended in midair. . . . </p><p class="hdg">Talmai</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37, 38</a><br />Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.
