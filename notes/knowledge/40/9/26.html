Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14</a><br />Now King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known, and people were saying, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a><br />For the king knows about these matters, and I can speak freely to him. I am confident that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.</p></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"></body></html>
