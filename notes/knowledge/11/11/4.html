He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.</p><p class="hdg">his wives</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-2.htm">1 Kings 11:2</a><br />These women were from the nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, "You must not intermarry with them, for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods." Yet Solomon clung to these women in love.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">Deuteronomy 7:4</a><br />because they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods. Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and He will swiftly destroy you.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a><br />He must not take many wives for himself, lest his heart go astray. He must not accumulate for himself great amounts of silver and gold.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-26.htm">Nehemiah 13:26, 27</a><br />Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, yet foreign women drew him into sin. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-6.htm">1 Kings 11:6, 38</a><br />So Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD--and unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-12.htm">1 Kings 6:12, 13</a><br />"As for this temple you are building, if you walk in My statutes, carry out My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by walking in them, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father David. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-61.htm">1 Kings 8:61</a><br />So let your heart be fully devoted to the LORD our God, as it is this day, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a><br />And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, with a heart of integrity and uprightness, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances, </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3, 14</a><br />Abijam walked in all the sins that his father before him had committed, and his heart was not as fully devoted to the LORD his God as the heart of David his forefather had been. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-3.htm">2 Kings 20:3</a><br />"Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a><br />As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-19.htm">1 Chronicles 29:19</a><br />And give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all Your commandments, decrees, and statutes, and to build Your palace for which I have made provision."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3</a><br />Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David.

He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-2.htm">2 Chronicles 34:2</a><br />And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.</p></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"></body></html>
