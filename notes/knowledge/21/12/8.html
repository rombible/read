Everything is futile!" . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:17</a><br />So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a><br />I saw that all labor and success spring from a man's envy of his neighbor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a><br />For who knows what is good for a man during the few days he passes through his fleeting life like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come after him under the sun?</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a><br />As no man has power over the wind to contain it, so there is no authority over the day of death. As no one can be discharged in wartime, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a><br />Lowborn men are but a vapor; the exalted but a lie. Weighed on the scale, they are pushed up; together they are but a breath.</p></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"></body></html>
