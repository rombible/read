Only if the king extends the gold scepter may that person live. But I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the past thirty days."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a><br />As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she found favor in his sight.
