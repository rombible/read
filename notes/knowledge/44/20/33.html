I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3-5</a><br />Here I am. Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed: Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I wronged or oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes? Tell me, and I will restore it to you. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12, 15, 18</a><br />If others have this right to your support, shouldn't we have it all the more?
