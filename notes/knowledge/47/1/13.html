We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a><br />Therefore, since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is clear to God, and I hope it is clear to your conscience as well.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-6.htm">2 Corinthians 13:6</a><br />And I hope you will realize that we have not failed the test.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-6.htm">Philemon 1:6</a><br />I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing that is ours in Christ.</p></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"></body></html>
