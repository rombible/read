Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a><br />We are not commending ourselves to you again. Instead, we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who take pride in appearances rather than in the heart.</p><p class="hdg">we speak.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-10.htm">2 Corinthians 11:10, 31</a><br />As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a><br />I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit.</p><p class="hdg">but.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm">2 Corinthians 5:13</a><br />If we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a><br />For even if I boast somewhat excessively about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a><br />This is why I write these things while absent, so that when I am present I will not need to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12-23</a><br />If others have this right to your support, shouldn't we have it all the more? But we did not exercise this right. Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-33.htm">1 Corinthians 10:33</a><br />just as I try to please everyone in all I do. For I am not seeking my own good, but the good of many, that they may be saved.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a><br />What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up the church.</p><p class="hdg">dearly.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm">2 Corinthians 12:15</a><br />And for the sake of your souls, I will most gladly spend my money and myself. If I love you more, will you love me less?</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a><br />Therefore, beloved, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that defiles body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a><br />Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but leave room for God's wrath. For it is written: "Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a><br />Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a><br />Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, that is how you must stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.</p></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"></body></html>
