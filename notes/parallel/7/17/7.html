B, and Syriac), to be omitted. If it applies to the young Levite, it must mean that he did not live in one of the Levitic cities, which belonged to his own family (the family of Gershom), which were in the northern and eastern tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-6.htm" title="And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.">Joshua 21:6</a>), but in Judah, and therefore was ranked in civil matters as belonging to that tribe. Homes in the tribe of Judah were assigned to the priests alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/21-9.htm" title="And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.">Joshua 21:9-42</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He sojourned there.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.">Judges 19:1</a>. The curse had been pronounced on the tribe of Levi: "I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm" title="Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.">Genesis 49:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of the family of Judah</span>. These words are difficult to explain. If the man was a Levite he could not be of the family or tribe of Judah. Some explain the words to be merely a more accurate definition of Bethlehem-judah, as if he would say, I <span class="accented">mean Bethlehem in the tribe of Judah.</span> Others explain them to mean that he was one of a family of Levites who had settled in Bethlehem, and so came to be reckoned in civil matters as belonging to Judah. Others, that he was of the family of Judah on his mother s side, which might be the cause of his settling at Bethlehem. But many commentators think them spurious, as they are not found in the Septuagint (Cod. Vat.), nor in the Peschito, nor in No. 440 of De Rossi's MSS. The Septuagint has <span class="accented">Bethlehem of the family of Judah.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
