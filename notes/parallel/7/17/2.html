It is the same sum which each of the lords of the Philistines promised to give Delilah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm" title="And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give you every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.">Judges 16:5</a>), and only six hundred shekels less than the entire mass of the earrings given to Gideon--only that those were golden shekels. It is hard to say whence this Ephraimitish lady could have amassed so large a sum.<p><span class= "bld">That were taken from thee.</span>--This is probably the true rendering. The LXX. (Cod.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Thou cursedst</span>. The Cethib and the Alexandrian Codex of the Septuagint read, <span class="accented">Thou cursedst</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. adjuredst me, which is a better reading. There is a direct and verbal reference to the law contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>. The word <span class="accented">thou cursedst</span> here and the voice of <span class="accented">swearing</span> in Leviticus are the same root. It was in consequence of this <span class="accented">adjuration</span> that Micah confessed his guilt. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>, when our Lord, on the adjuration of the high priest, broke his silence and confessed that he was Christ, the Son of God. In Achan's confession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19, 20</a>) there is no distinct reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, though this may have been the ground of it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end of this book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. Jud 20:28. That it might appear how happy the nation was under the Judges, here is showed how unhappy they were when there was no Judge. The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</body></html>
