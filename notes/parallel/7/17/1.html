The Talmud (<span class= "ital">Sanhedr. </span>103, <span class= "ital">b</span>) says that he lived at Garab, not far from Shiloh, but the name ("a blotch") is probably a term of scorn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>).

Most of the idolatrous violations of the second commandment occurred in the northern kingdom (Gideon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-27.htm" title="And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.">Judges 8:27</a>; Micah, Judges 17; Jeroboam, 1 Kings 12, 13). These apostasies were not a worship of other gods, but a worship of the true God under unauthorised conditions, and with forbidden images.<p><span class= "bld">Whose name was Micah.</span>--Scripture does not deem it necessary to say anything more about him.

We no longer have to do with judges and their mighty deeds in delivering Israel from his oppressors, but with two detached histories, which fill up the rest of the book, relating to the internal affairs of Israel. There is no note of time, except that they happened before the time of Saul the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), and. that Phinehas the son of Eleazar was alive at the time of the occurrence of the second (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>). Both, no doubt, are long prior to Samson. The only apparent connection of the history of Micah with that of Samson is that both relate to the tribe of Dan, and it may be presumed were contained in the annals of that tribe. Compare the opening of the Books of Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mount Ephraim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hill country of Ephraim, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24</a>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end of this book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. Jud 20:28. That it might appear how happy the nation was under the Judges, here is showed how unhappy they were when there was no Judge. The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</body></html>
