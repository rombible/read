The word used for a graven image is <span class= "ital">pesel, </span>and for a molten image is <span class= "ital">massecah. </span>They are the very words used in the curse against idolaters in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm" title="Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>. Some suppose the two words to be used by Hendiadys (like "cups and gold" for "golden cups" ) to describe <span class= "ital">one silver image </span>adorned with sculptured ornament. All that is clear is that the <span class= "ital">pesel </span>is the more prominent, but the details are left quite vague. It is therefore impossible to determine whether the graven and molten image consisted of one or of two silver "calves," like that of the wilderness, and those afterwards set up by Jeroboam at Dan and Bethel. <span class= "ital">This, </span>however, was a form which the violation of the second commandment was constantly liable to take, and it probably involved much less blame than other violations of it--<span class= "ital">not, </span>as is often stated, because the Israelites had become familiar with the worship of Apis and Mnevis in Egypt, but because the calf was a recognised cherubic emblem, and had consequently been deliberately sanctioned in the symbolism of the Temple. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm" title="You shall not make to you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.">Exodus 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-23.htm" title="You shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall you make to you gods of gold.">Exodus 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-4.htm" title="And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-25.htm" title="It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above on them, and all their hinder parts were inward.">1Kings 7:25</a>, &c.) Some suppose that the <span class= "ital">massecah </span>was the pedestal of the <span class= "ital">pesel, </span>and that it was too heavy for the Danites to carry away, since it is not mentioned among the things which they seized.<p><span class= "bld">Now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">for thee</span>--in which case "I will restore it" may possibly mean "use it for its original purpose for thy advantage." If not, a slight correction would give us the much simpler reading of the Syriac, "restore it to <span class= "ital">me."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had wholly dedicated</span>. It is not clear whether the words are to be rendered as in the A.V., <span class="accented">had</span> <span class="accented">dedicated</span>, expressing the dedication of them before they were stolen, or whether they merely express her present purpose so to dedicate them. But the A.V. makes very good sense. Her former purpose had been that the money should be given for her son's benefit to make his house an house of gods. Now that he had confessed, she resumed her purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore I restore it unto thee</span> - that is, in the shape of the graven and molten images, as it follows in the next verse. The narrative gives a curious example of the semi-idolatry of the times. <span class="cmt_word">A graven image and a molten image</span>. There is a good deal of difficulty in assigning the exact meaning of the two words here used, and their relation to one another in the worship to which they belong. <span class="accented">The molten image</span> (<span class="accented">massechah</span>), however, seems to be pretty certainly the <span class="accented">metal</span>, here the <span class="accented">silver</span>, image of a calf, the form which the corrupt worship of Jehovah took from the time when Aaron made the molten calf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>, called there '<span class="accented">egel massechah</span>, a molten calf) to the time when Jeroboam set up the golden calves at Dan and Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28, 29</a>). And that <span class="accented">massechah</span> means something <span class="accented">molten is</span> certain both from its etymology (<span class="accented">nasach</span>, to pour) and from what Aaron said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-24.htm">Exodus 32:24</a>: "I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf." Here too Micah's mother gives the silver to the founder, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the fuser of metals. The <span class="accented">pesel</span>, or <span class="accented">graven image</span>, on the other hand, is something hewn or graven, whether in wood or stone, and sometimes overlaid with gold and silver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). One might have thought, from the language of ver. 4, and from the mention of the <span class="accented">pesel</span> alone in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30, 31</a>, that only one image is here intended, which was graven with the chisel after it was cast, as Aaron's calf seems to have been. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-17.htm">Judges 18:17, 18</a> they are mentioned separately, with the ephod and teraphim named between them, so that they must be distinct. From the above passages the <span class="accented">pesel or graven image</span> would seem to have been the most important object, and the difficulty is to assign the true relation of the <span class="accented">massechah</span> or <span class="accented">molten image</span> to it. Hengstenberg thinks the <span class="accented">massechah</span> was a pedestal on which the <span class="accented">pesel</span> stood, and that the ephod was the robe with which the <span class="accented">pesel</span> was clothed, and that the teraphim were certain tokens or emblems attached to the ephod which gave oracular answers. But this is not much more than guess-work. Berthean considers the ephod, here as elsewhere, to be the priest's garment, put on when performing the most solemn services, and specially when seeking an answer from God. And he thinks that the <span class="accented">massechah</span> formed a part of the ornament of the ephod, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a> the Hebrew has "the <span class="accented">pesel</span> of the ephod." The teraphin he thinks are idols, a kind of <span class="accented">Dii minores</span> associated with the worship of Jehovah in this impure worship. But there does not seem to be any means at present of arriving at any certainty. The <span class="accented">massechah</span> might be a rich gold or silver overlaying of the wooden image, possibly movable, or it might be the separate image of a calf supposed to belong, as it were, to the <span class="accented">pesel</span>, and to symbolise the attributes of the Godhead. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end of this book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. Jud 20:28. That it might appear how happy the nation was under the Judges, here is showed how unhappy they were when there was no Judge. The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</body></html>
