And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-13.htm" title="And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he said to you, Wash, and be clean?">2Kings 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-21.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?">2Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-21.htm" title="And I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your girdle, and I will commit your government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.">Isaiah 22:21</a>, &c.). Micah knew enough of the law to be aware of the extreme irregularity of his conduct in making one of his own sons his priest.<p><span class= "bld">Ten shekels of silver.</span>--Thus the grandson of Moses became priest of an idolatrous worship at a salary of 25s. a year!<p><span class= "bld">By the year.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">by days. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-29.htm" title="And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.">Leviticus 25:29</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A suit of apparel.</span>--The Vulgate renders these words "a double robe." It seems to mean either "an order of garments" or "the value of garments," i.e., "your clothes."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A father</span>. This is not a common application of the word father in the Old Testament. The prominent idea seems to be one of honour, combined with authority to teach and advise. It is applied to prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), and to Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>). The idea is implied in the converse phrase of <span class="accented">son</span>, applied to those to whom the prophets stood in 'the relation of spiritual fathers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10, 20</a>, and frequently elsewhere). The abuse of the feeling which dictates the term as applied to human teachers is reproved by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>). It has been freely used in the Christian Church, as in the titles <span class="accented">papa</span> or <span class="accented">pope</span> applied to bishops, <span class="accented">abbot</span> and <span class="accented">abbas</span>, <span class="accented">father in God</span>, <span class="accented">fathers of the Church</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> Here there is perhaps a special reference to the function of Micah's priest to ask counsel of God, and then give that counsel to those who came to inquire (see note to ver. 5). It may be added that the idea of <span class="accented">counsellor</span> seems to be inherent in the word cohen or <span class="accented">priest</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Ten shekels</span> - a little over a pound of our money, but probably equivalent to &pound;20, when considered relatively to articles of consumption. <span class="cmt_word">A suit of apparel</span>. There is great doubt as to the exact meaning of the word rendered <span class="accented">suit</span> in this connection. The word means anything <span class="accented">arranged</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> put in a <span class="accented">rank</span>, or <span class="accented">row</span>, or <span class="accented">order.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a> it is applied to the shewbread: "He ordered the bread in order." Thence it came to mean the <span class="accented">estimation</span> or <span class="accented">worth</span> of a person or thing - some-what as we use the word <span class="accented">rank.</span> From this last sense some interpret the word here to mean the <span class="accented">worth</span> or <span class="accented">price</span> of his clothes. Others, including St. Jerome and the Septuagint, interpret it <span class="accented">a pair</span> of vestments, meaning summer and winter clothing. But perhaps the A.V., <span class="accented">suit</span>, meaning the whole set of under and upper garments, is after all the best interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">The Levite went in</span>. The Hebrew is <span class="accented">went</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the common use of the word, <span class="accented">went his way.</span> And such is probably the meaning here. He went his way to consider the proposal made to him. The result is given in the next verse: <span class="accented">And the Levite was content</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
