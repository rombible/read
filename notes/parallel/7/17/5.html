How he coordinated this worship with his grossly idolatrous symbols, or whom those symbols were intended to represent, it is impossible to say. The fact remains that in the Beth-Micah we find "a house of gods"--"whole chapel of idols"--consecrated to Jehovah as a pious act (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm" title="And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.

(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-27.htm" title="And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.">Judges 8:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And teraphim.</span>--These were Syrian images (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>), the use of which among the Israelites seems to have lasted for a long period, until it was put down by King Josiah in his great reformation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.">2Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.">Ezekiel 21:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm" title="For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.">Zechariah 10:2</a>). I have entered upon the interesting question of the use of Teraphim in an article on the subject in <span class= "ital">Kitto's Cyclop?dia. </span>(See <span class= "ital">Excursus II: Teraphim.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Consecrated.</span>--The curious Hebrew phrase is "filled the hand" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-41.htm" title="And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-24.htm" title="And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.">Exodus 29:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-37.htm" title="This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;">Leviticus 7:37</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>gave him the office by putting certain offerings in his hands. It is rather <span class= "ital">installed </span>than "consecrated."<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS II</span>.--ON <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>. (TERAPHIM.)<p>THE Hebrew word <span class= "ital">Teraphim </span>is always simply transliterated as in our version, or rendered by "images," with "teraphim" in the margin, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.">1Samuel 15:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm" title="For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.">Zechariah 10:2</a>, where it is represented by "idolatry," "idols." The singular of the word, "a teraph," does not occur in Scripture, although it is clear that only one can have been put into David's bed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.">1Samuel 19:13-16</a>). The LXX. adopt many different renderings, as does the Vulg., but they all point to idolatrous images or the implements of necromancy, as do the two renderings of the Targums, images and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>) "announcers."<p>1. Teraphim are first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>, where Rachel steals her father's "images," and successfully hides them from his search under the <span class= "ital">hiran </span>on which she was sitting--the coarse carpet used to cover the wicker-work pack-saddle of her camel. Josephus supposes that she was actuated by idolatrous reverence; Iben Ezra that she expected oracular guidance from them; others that she stole them because of their intrinsic value. She probably shared the superstitions of her father, and regarded them as sacred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-14.htm" title="And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son's mandrakes.">Genesis 30:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm" title="And now, though you would needs be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?">Genesis 31:30</a>), as being the figures of ancestral divinities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-53.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.">Genesis 31:53</a>). It is not impossible that they were among the "strange gods" which Jacob ordered his family to bury under "the sorcerer's oak"--<span class= "ital">Allon</span> Meonenim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-37.htm" title="And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.">Judges 9:37</a>). But that Jacob's right feeling in the matter was not permanent is proved only too clearly by the conduct of Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>) and the Danites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-3.htm" title="When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought you here? and what make you in this place? and what have you here?">Judges 18:3</a>), although, unlike Jeroboam, they could not even plead the poor palliation of political motives.<p>2. The next definite notice of teraphim occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.">1Samuel 19:13-16</a>, where Michal, in the dark eastern chamber, conceals her husband's absence by putting the teraphim in his bed, with a bolster of goat's hair for a pillow. The use of the article shows that even in David's family the use of the "teraphim" was perfectly well known. Nor can we rely on the vague conjecture of Thenius, that barren women (Rachel and Michal) were especially addicted to their worship, or on that of Michaelis, that Michal may have possessed them unknown to David. The passage seems to show that they had at least some rude resemblance to the human shape, whence Aquila renders the word by protomai ("busts"), which is used of figures like the ancient Hermae. This is not the place to enter into the curious reading of the LXX. on this verse, by which they seem to connect the worship of teraphim with what the ancients called extispicium--i.e., divination by means of the liver of sacrifices, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a>. Josephus follows the same reading, and dishonestly suppresses all mention of the teraphim.<p>3. The next important passage is <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>, where the prima facie view of every unbiassed reader would be that the "image" (matsebah) and the teraphim are mentioned without blame as ordinary adjuncts to religious worship. Hence, perhaps, arose the notion that the teraphim were in some way connected with the Urim and Thummim, which led to the rendering of the word in this passage by <span class= "greekheb">?????</span> (LXX., "bright gems"), and by <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span> ("enlightenments," Aquila), and by "implements of priestly dress" (St. Jerome). This is the theory maintained most unconvincingly, though with great learning, by Spencer in his <span class= "ital">De Legibus Hebr?-orum, </span>lib. 3, pp. 920-1038.<p>But if these passages show that even in religious families teraphim were sometimes tolerated as material adjuncts to an Elohistic worship, on the other hand we find them unequivocally condemned by Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.">1Samuel 15:23</a>), by Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm" title="Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.">2Kings 23:24</a>), and by the prophet Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm" title="For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.">Zechariah 10:2</a> ); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a> the use of them, is attributed to the heathen Nebuchadnezzar.<p>The general inference seems to be that the use of the teraphim involved a violation of the second commandment, but that this use of symbols, this <span class= "ital">monotheistic idolatry, </span>which is very different from polytheism, arises from a tendency very deeply ingrained in human nature, and which it took many years to eradicate. If centuries elapsed before the Jews were cured of their propensity to worship "other gods,"we can feel no surprise that "image worship" continued to linger among them, in spite of the condemnation of it by the stricter prophets. The calf-worship, the toleration of teraphim and consecrated stones (<span class= "ital">baetylia</span>) and high places, the offering of incense to the brazen serpent, the glimpses of grave irregularities even in the worship of the sanctuary, show that it was only by centuries of misfortune and a succession of prophets that Israel was at last educated into the spiritual worship of the true God.<p>The reader will find further remarks on this subject in the article on "Teraphim," by the present writer, in Kitto's <span class= "ital">Biblical Cyclop?dia.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man Micah</span>, etc. It is impossible to say for certain whether the state of things here described in respect of Micah preceded the events narrated in the preceding verses, or was consequent upon them. If it preceded, then we have the reason of his mother's vow: she wished to make her son's "house of God" complete by the addition of a graven and molten image. If it was consequent upon his mother's vow, then we have in the opening verses of this chapter a history of the circumstances of the foundation of Micah's "house of God," which was to play an important part in the colony of Danites, whose proceedings arc related in the following chapter, and for the sake of which this domestic history of Micah is introduced. <span class="cmt_word">House of gods</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">of God</span> (Elohim); for the worship was of Jehovah, only with a corrupt and semi-idolatrous ceremonial. <span class="cmt_word">An ephod</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26, 27</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Teraphim</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a> (images, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a> (idolatry, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); 19:13 (an image, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>,to etc. They seem to have been a kind of Penates, or household gods, and were used for divination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Became his priest</span>. One function of the priest, and for which it is likely he was much resorted to, was to inquire of God by the ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 6</a>). What his other duties might be does not appear. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end of this book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. Jud 20:28. That it might appear how happy the nation was under the Judges, here is showed how unhappy they were when there was no Judge. The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</body></html>
