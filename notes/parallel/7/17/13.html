So far as Micah was devout and sincere, we must feel that the Lord did him good by stripping him of his gorgeous instruments of superstition and humbling his pride.<p><span class= "bld">I have a Levite to my priest.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the Levite. </span>The article may be generic, meaning "one of the Levites;" but Jonathan, as a son of Gershom, has a special right to be called "<span class= "ital">the </span>Levite," as a representative of the tribe. It is at least doubtful whether the priestly functions expected of him in this instance included sacrifice; but, in any case, Micah could hardly have been entirely unaware that the Levites were incapable of priestly functions ("Seek ye the <span class= "ital">priesthood </span>also?"--<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-10.htm" title="And he has brought you near to him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you: and seek you the priesthood also?">Numbers 16:10</a>), or of the fact that the authorised worship of the nation was to be confined to the place which God should choose, which in this instance was Shiloh. In any case, however, the passage furnishes us with a fresh proof of the utter neglect of the Mosaic law, as represented in the Book of Leviticus, from a very early period. His "house of God" seems to have resembled the high places, which even the faithful kings of Israel were unable or unwilling to clear away. They were ultimately cleared away by Hezekiah, but not without so great a shock to the then established custom, that Rabshakeh actually appeals to the fact in proof of Hezekiah's impiety, and as a sign that he has forfeited the favour of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-22.htm" title="But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?">2Kings 18:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Micah</span>, etc. We may notice this incidental proof that the Levites in the time of Micah held the religious position which is ascribed to them in the Pentateuch. <span class="cmt_word">I have a Levite</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">the Levite</span>, meaning the particular Levite of whom it is the question. <span class="accented">A Levite</span> would be without the article, as in ver. 7, or would be expressed as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-1.htm">Judges 19:1</a> (Hebrews), a man a <span class="accented">Levite.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
