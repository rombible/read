It is left to be understood that the remaining nine hundred shekels were spent in other parts of the idolatrous worship. (It may be mentioned, by way of passing illustration, that when Sir John Hawle was murdered in Westminster Abbey, the 200 paid in penance by his murderers seem to have been expended upon the purchase of a costly image, which was placed in the Chapel of St. Erasmus.)<p><span class= "bld">Gave them to the founder.</span>--An illustration of the folly which Isaiah pursues with such a storm of irony and contempt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/46-6.htm" title="They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it a god: they fall down, yes, they worship.">Isaiah 46:6-13</a>).

(CALF-WORSHIP.)<p>IT may be regarded as certain, from the testimony of Scripture itself, that the calf of Aaron and those by which the rebel king<p>"Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,<p>Likening his Maker to the grazed ox,"<p>were not idols in the ordinary sense of the word, but were intended as symbols of the one God. The calf-worship was a violation not of the first, but of the second commandment. The main element of the fourfold cherub was certainly an ox, as is clear from the comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-14.htm" title="And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 10:14</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-7.htm" title="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Judges 1:7-8</a>; and the knowledge of this cherubic emblem was not confined to the Jews, but was spread at least through all Semitic races. That the calf was intended to be an emblem of God seems to be the opinion of Josephus, who in such a matter would represent creditable Jewish traditions (<span class= "ital">Antt. viii.</span> 8, ? 4). Aaron in proclaiming the feast at the inauguration of his golden calf distinctly calls it a feast to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-5.htm" title="And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.">Exodus 32:5</a>). It was the well-understood purpose of Jeroboam not to introduce a new worship, but to provide a convenient modification of the old; and it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-16.htm" title="And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?">1Kings 22:16</a> that the prophets of the calf-worship still regarded themselves, and were regarded, as the prophets of Jehovah; but the fate of Amos is sufficient to show that they must have sanctioned, or at least tolerated, the use of these unauthorised symbols, against which, so far as we are informed, not even Elijah or Elisha ever raised their voices, though the former was so implacable a foe to all idolatry, and the latter lived on terms of close friendship with at least one of the northern kings. (See the article "Calf," by the present writer, in Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet he restored</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">so he</span> <span class="accented">restored</span>, repeating what was said in ver. 3, and adding the consequence, that his mother took two hundred shekels and gave them to the founder. It is a great puzzle to explain why <span class="accented">two hundred</span> shekels only are here spoken of, and what became of the other <span class="accented">nine hundred.</span> Bertheau thinks the <span class="accented">two hundred</span> were different from the eleven hundred, and were the fifth part of the whole value stolen, which the thief, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, was bound to give in addition to the principal. He therefore translates ver. 4 thus: "So he restored the money to his mother (and his mother took two hundred shekels), and she gave it (the money 1100 shekels) to the founder," etc. Others understand that two hundred only were actually made into the graven and molten image, and the other nine hundred were devoted to other expenses of the worship. <span class="cmt_word">In the house of Micah</span>. This explains, <span class="accented">Now I will restore it unto thee</span>, and, <span class="accented">for my son to</span> make, etc., in ver. 3. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end of this book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. Jud 20:28. That it might appear how happy the nation was under the Judges, here is showed how unhappy they were when there was no Judge. The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</body></html>
