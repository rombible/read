It was six miles from Pella, on the top of a hill which lies on the road from Pella to Gerasa. For some reason with which we are unacquainted, there seems to have been a bond of intense sympathy between the inhabitants of this town and Benjamin. If their abstinence from the assembly of vengeance was not due to this, we must suppose that the sort of companionship in misery caused by these wild events itself created a sense of union between these communities, for it is the peril of Jabesh which first arouses King Saul to action (1 Samuel 11). and in memory of the deliverance which he effected the men of Jabesh alone save the bodies of Saul and Jonathan from the indignity of rotting on the wall of Bethshan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-11.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;">1Samuel 31:11</a>), which gained them the blessing of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/2-5.htm" title="And David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of the LORD, that you have showed this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.">2Samuel 2:5-6</a>). We see from these later incidents that Jabesh recovered from the extermination now inflicted on its inhabitants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
