</span>or (as in the margin), <span class= "ital">Gratify us in them. </span>The verse is somewhat obscure, but its general drift is a promise to pacify the parents of the damsels, by showing them that thus they did not violate the <span class= "ital">cherem, </span>and that the cause was pressing. Perhaps they would be more readily consoled, because the land of these six hundred Benjamites must now have been far more than was necessary for their wants. They had become possessors of the lot of the whole tribe. Perhaps the reading should be, <span class= "ital">Gratify us as regards these damsels, for they </span>(<span class= "ital">the Benjamites</span>)<span class= "ital"> have not received every man his wife through the war.</span><p><span class= "bld">At this time.</span>--Rather, perhaps, <span class= "ital">in that case </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>if you had <span class= "ital">given </span>them your daughters in marriage, ye would be guilty"). We are left to assume that the appeal of the elders to the parents whose two hundred daughters were thus seized was sufficient to pacify them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be favourable unto them for our sakes</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">Grant us them as a favour</span>, the masculine <span class="accented">them</span> referring to <span class="accented">the daughters of Shiloh</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in ver. 12, and the verb <span class="accented">grant a favour</span> being followed by a double accusative. <span class="cmt_word">We reserved not to each man his wife</span>, etc. These words are somewhat difficult. If we may insert the word to, as the A.V. does, before <span class="accented">each</span> <span class="accented">man</span> (for it is wanting in the Hebrew), the sense is good. The Israelites acknowledge their own fault in not reserving women enough to be wives to the Benjamites, and ask the fathers and brothers of the daughters of Shiloh to do them a favour by enabling them to repair their fault. But it is rather a strain upon the words. The omission of the <span class="accented">to</span> is not natural in such a phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a> is hardly to the point, nor is <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>, where the <span class="accented">to</span> had been expressed before the us), and <span class="accented">reserved</span> is a forced interpretation of the verb. If the words were spoken by the Benjamites, all would be plain and easy: "We received not each man his wife in the war." Hence some put the speech into the mouth of Benjamin, as though the Israelites meant, We will say in your names, in your persons, as your attorneys, so to speak, "Grant them to us," etc. But this is rather forced. Others, therefore, follow the Peschito, and read, "<span class="accented">because</span> THEY received not each man his wife," etc., which makes very good sense, but has not MS. authority. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did not give</span>, etc., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you need not fear the guilt of the broken oath, because you did not <span class="accented">give</span> your daughters, so as to violate the oath (ver. 7), but they were taken from you by force. The A.V. gives the probable meaning of the passage, though it is somewhat obscure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
