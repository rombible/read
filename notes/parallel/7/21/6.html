therefore they said (repeating ver. 5), What one is there that came not up to Mizpeh? (ver. 8) and on numbering the people it was found that no one had come up from Jabesh-gilead. This is the first time that <span class="cmt_word">Jabesh-gilead</span> is mentioned in Scripture. It comes up twice afterwards. First in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>, on occasion of its being besieged by the Ammonites and rescued by Saul; and secondly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>, when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shah, and buried them at Jabesh, for which brave and pious act David thanked them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>). The name of <span class="accented">Jabesh</span> is only preserved in the Wady <span class="accented">Yabis</span>, which debouches on the eastern bank of the Jordan about lat. 32'24. Robinson thinks the ruins called ed Deir in this valley are the remains of Jabesh, which agrees exactly with the situation assigned to it by Eusebius in the , Onomasticon.' <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
