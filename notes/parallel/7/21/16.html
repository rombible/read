The sense of the binding nature of the "ban" was intensely strong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm" title="You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-18.htm" title="Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, see, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.">Ezekiel 17:18-19</a>), but, as is so often the case among rude and ignorant people, they fancied that it was sufficient to keep it <span class= "ital">literally, </span>while in effect they violated it. Similarly in Herodotus (iv. 154), Themison having sworn to throw Phronima into the sea--the <span class= "ital">intention </span>having been that she should be drowned--feels himself bound to throw her into the sea, but has her drawn out of it again. Their want of moral enlightenment revealed itself in this way, and still more in having ever taken this horrible oath, which involved the butchery of innocent men, and of still more innocent women and children. In point of fact, the <span class= "ital">cherem </span>often broke down under the strain which it placed on men's best feelings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-45.htm" title="And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.">1Samuel 14:45</a>) as well as on their lower temptations. The guilt of breaking a guilty vow is only the original guilt of ever having made it. What the Israelites should have done was not to bathe their hands in more rivers of fraternal blood, but to pray to God to forgive the brutal vehemence which disgraced a cause originally righteous, and to have allowed the remnant of the Benjamites to intermarry with them once more. As it was, they were led by ignorance and rashness into several vows which could not be fulfilled without horrible cruelty and bloodshed, and the fulfilment of which they after all casuistically evaded, and that at the cost of still more bloodshed. As all these events took place under the guidance of Phinehas, they give us a high estimate indeed of the zeal which was his noblest characteristic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-30.htm" title="Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.">Psalm 106:30</a>), yet a very low estimate of his state of spiritual insight; and clearly to such a man the fulfilment of Jephthah's <span class= "ital">cherem </span>by sacrificing his daughter (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,">Judges 11:39</a>) would have seemed as nothing compared to the extermination of tribes and of cities, involving the shedding of rivers of innocent blood. But why should we suppose that the grandson of Aaron, in such times as these--when all was anarchy, idolatry, and restlessness, against which he either did not strive or strove most ineffectually--should stand on so much higher a level than his schismatical and semi-idolatrous cousin, the wandering grandson of Moses?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing the women</span>.
