If so, the idiom is like the Greek one in which a woman speaking of herself in the plural uses the masculine (<span class= "ital">Brief Greek Syntax, </span>p. 61). There is no other trace of this idiom in Hebrew, but we can hardly suppose that many Jabesh-Gileadite captives were brought to Shiloh, and then put to death in cold blood in accordance with the ban.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the camp to Shiloh.</span>--The Israelites, now that the war with Benjamin was over, appear to have moved their stationary camp to Shiloh, the normal and more central seat of the tabernacle at this period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm" title="And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.">Judges 18:31</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which is in the land of Canaan.</span>--We find the same addition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm" title="And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.">Joshua 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-9.htm" title="And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.">Joshua 22:9</a>. Perhaps there was another Shiloh on the east of the Jordan; but see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm" title="Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.">Judges 21:19</a>. The mere fact of Jabesh being in <span class= "ital">Gilead </span>does not seem sufficient to account for it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Shiloh</span>, whither it should seem they had now taken the tabernacle back, the war with Benjamin no longer requiring its presence at Bethel <span class="cmt_word">Them</span>. It is masculine in the Hebrew, though it refers to the women. So again in ver. 22, <span class="accented">their fathers and their brothers in</span> the masculine (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-23.htm">Judges 19:23</a>, and vers. 21, 22). It is perhaps an archaism. <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Canaan</span>. This <span class="accented">is</span> inserted to contrast it with Jabesh in Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17, 18</a>, and ch. 8:5, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
