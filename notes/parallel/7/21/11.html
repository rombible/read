(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-21.htm" title="But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.">Leviticus 27:21-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-2.htm" title="And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.">Numbers 21:2-3</a>.) The words are easy to read; it is needless to dwell on the horror of the massacre which they describe. We are dealing throughout with the fierce passions of men living in times of gross spiritual darkness; for we cannot doubt that the oath against Jabesh-Gilead was carried out, though the writer drops a veil over all but the result. The vow of destruction (<span class= "ital">cherem, anathema, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28-29</a>) was quite different from the vow of devotion (<span class= "ital">neder</span>) and the vow of abstinence (<span class= "ital">corban</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>(11) <span class= "bld">To dance in dances.</span>--Possibly the dances of the vintage festival. There is a fountain in a narrow dale, at a little distance from Shiloh, which was very probably the scene of this event. It is a needless conjecture that the feast was the Passover, and the dances a commemoration of the defeat of the Egyptians, like those of Miriam. There seems to have been no regular town at Shiloh; at least, no extensive ruins are traceable. It was probably a community like the Beth-Micah (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Judges 18:2</a>), which was mainly connected with the service of the Tabernacle. The "daughters of Shiloh" would naturally include many women who were in one way or other employed in various functions about the Tabernacle, and not only those who came there to worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm" title="Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Samuel 2:22</a>, where "assembled" should be rendered <span class= "ital">served, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:23</a>; "the handmaid" of the priests is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2Samuel 17:17</a>). But the traces of female attendants in the sanctuary are more numerous in Jewish traditions than in Scripture.<p><span class= "bld">Catch you every man his wife.</span>--The scene is very analogous to the famous seizure of the Sabine women at the Consualia, as described in Liv. i. 9. St. Jerome (<span class= "ital">adv. Jovin, </span>1 ? 41) quotes another parallel from the history of Aristomenes of Messene, who once, in a similar way, seized fifteen Spartan maidens, who were dancing at the Hyacinthia, and escaped with them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
