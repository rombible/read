So in Virgil, the Scipios are called "two lightnings of war." (Comp. Boanerges, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-17.htm" title="And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:">Mark 3:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Kedesh-naphtali.</span>--The name "Kedesh" means a <span class= "ital">holy </span>city. There were, therefore, many towns of the name, as Kadesh-Barnea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm" title="And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,">Joshua 15:23</a>), and Kedesh in Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-22.htm" title="The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;">Joshua 12:22</a>). Jerusalem is called "the holy, the noble" (<span class= "ital">El kuds, es shereef</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This sanctuary of Naphtali was a Levitical refuge city in Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-35.htm" title="And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,">Joshua 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-32.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.">Joshua 21:32</a>). Josephus says that it was not far from Ph?nicia (Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. xiii.</span> 5, ? 6). The site of it is probably at Kades, four miles north-west of Lake Merom. The reading of the Syriac and Arabic versions here--<span class= "ital">Rakam</span>--is inexplicable. The fact that the fame of Barak had penetrated from the northern city to the southern limits of Ephraim shows that he must have been a man of great mark.<p><span class= "bld">Draw.</span>--The meaning of the word is uncertain. The Rabbis understand "the people," others understand "thy steps," referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-21.htm" title="And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.">Genesis 37:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a> (Heb.). The LXX. has "thou shalt depart;" the Vulgate, <span class= "ital">"lead;" </span>the Chaldee, "spread out," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-37.htm" title="And the liers in wait hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.">Judges 20:37</a>. There, however, our version gives in the margin the alternative "<span class= "ital">made a long </span>sound with the trumpet," and the verb is used in that sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm" title="There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.">Exodus 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.">Joshua 6:5</a>, but there the substantive is added. The word probably implies that Barak is to draw his troops together in small contingents to prevent suspicion.<p><span class= "bld">Mount Tabor.</span>--The broad flat top of this strong, beautiful, and easily fortified mountain (which is nearly a mile in circumference) would serve the double purpose of a watch-post and a stronghold. It was in the district of Issachar, about six miles from Nazareth, and its peculiarities attracted notice in very early days (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-22.htm" title="And the coast reaches to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.">Joshua 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-12.htm" title="The north and the south you have created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your name.">Psalm 89:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm" title="As I live, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.">Jeremiah 46:18</a>). Josephus calls it Itaburion; he held it for some time successfully against Placidus and the Romans (Jos., <span class= "ital">B. J. </span>iv. 1, ? 8). Its huge truncated cone of limestone rises isolated from the plain to the height of nearly nineteen hundred feet, and its sides are clothed with oaks and terebinths. It is now called Jebel et Tur. It was long regarded as the scene of the Transfiguration, but it must yield this glory to Mount Hermon. But the sacred character of the hill seems to be distinctly intimated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-19.htm" title="They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.">Deuteronomy 33:19</a> : "They (Zebulon and Issachar) shall call the people unto the mountains; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm" title="As I live, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.">Jeremiah 46:18</a> : "As I live, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of Hosts, surely as Tabor is among the mountains . . . so shall he come."<p><span class= "bld">Of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun.</span>--The northern tribes would feel most painfully the tyranny of Jabin, and these were the two most energetic of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kedesh-naphtali</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Kedesh in the tribe of Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-37.htm">Joshua 19:37</a>), as distinguished from Kedesh in the south of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23</a>), and others.

There are numerous ancient remains. <span class="cmt_word">Hath not the Lord</span>, etc. She sneaks as "a prophetess" announcing God s commands, not her own opinions; declaring God's promises, not merely her own hopes or wishes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-9 Deborah was a prophetess; one instructed in Divine knowledge by the inspiration of the Spirit of God. She judged Israel as God's mouth to them; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction, she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it. Barak values the satisfaction of his mind, and the good success of his enterprise, more than mere honour.</body></html>
