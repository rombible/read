The expression is probably used by anticipation. He could hardly have meant to fly to Jael rather than to Heber, until Jael came to meet him, unless there are circumstances unknown to us. Women had separate tents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm" title="And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.">Genesis 18:6</a>), and these were regarded as inviolably secure. He thought that there he would lie unsuspected till the pursuers passed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-67.htm" title="And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.">Genesis 24:67</a>). The name Jael means "gazelle" (like Tabitha, Dorcas), "a fit name for a Bedouin's wife--especially for one whose family had come from the rocks of Engedi, the spring of the wild goat or chamois" (Stanley).<p><span class= "bld">For there was peace.</span>--This enabled Sisera boldly to appeal to these nomads for <span class= "ital">dakheel</span>--the sacred duty of protection. A poor strolling Bedouin tribe might well be left by Jabin to its natural independence; tribute can only be secured from Fellahin--i.e., from settled tribes. Three days must have elapsed since the battle before it would be possible for Sisera to fly on foot from the Kishon to "the nomad's terebinth." It may well be conceived that the unfortunate general arrived there in miserable plight--a starving and ruined fugitive.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 Sisera's chariots had been his pride and his confidence. Thus are those disappointed who rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not only breaks under them, but pierces them with many sorrows. The idol may quickly become a burden, Isa 46:1; what we were sick for, God can make us sick of. It is probable that Jael really intended kindness to Sisera; but by a Divine impulse she was afterwards led to consider him as the determined enemy of the Lord and of his people, and to destroy him. All our connexions with God's enemies must be broken off, if we would have the Lord for our God, and his people for our people. He that had thought to have destroyed Israel with his many iron chariots, is himself destroyed with one iron nail. Thus the weak things of the world confound the mighty. The Israelites would have prevented much mischief, if they had sooner destroyed the Canaanites, as God commanded and enabled them: but better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience, than never be wise.</body></html>
