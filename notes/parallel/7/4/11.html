(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Pitched his tent.</span>--(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm" title="And he removed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 12:8</a>, &c.) The "tents" of the Bedouin are not the bell-shaped tents with which we are familiar, but coverings of black goats' hair, sometimes supported on as many as nine poles. The Arab word for tent is <span class= "ital">beit, "</span>house."<p><span class= "bld">Unto the plain of Zaanaim.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">unto the terebinth in Zaanaim. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-33.htm" title="And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:">Joshua 19:33</a>.) Great trees are often alluded to in Scripture. (Allon-Bachuth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm" title="But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.">Genesis 35:8</a>, "the oak of Tabor"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm" title="Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:">1Samuel 10:3</a>, "the oak of the house of grace"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-9.htm" title="The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:">1Kings 4:9</a>, "the enchanters' oak"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-37.htm" title="And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.">Judges 9:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm" title="And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.">Joshua 24:26</a>, &c.) This terebinth is again alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-33.htm" title="And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:">Joshua 19:33</a>; and the size and beauty of the terebinths on the hills of Naphtali, to which we find allusion in the blessing of Jacob, probably led to its adoption as the symbol of the tribe. "Naphtali is a branching terebinth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-21.htm" title="Naphtali is a hind let loose: he gives goodly words.">Genesis 49:21</a>). The word <span class= "ital">elon </span>(<span class= "greekheb">????</span>) is constantly rendered "plain" by our translators (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/9-6.htm" title="And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.">Judges 9:6-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm" title="Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm" title="Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:">1Samuel 10:3</a>, &c), because they were misled by the Targums and the Vulgate, which render it sometimes by <span class= "ital">vallis </span>and <span class= "ital">convallis. </span>They always render the cognate word <span class= "ital">allon </span>by "oak," and, in the looseness of common nomenclature, the "oak" and the "terebinth" were not always carefully distinguished. There is a large terebinth, called <span class= "ital">Sigar em-Messiah, </span>six miles north-west of Kedes. The word Zaanaim (also written Zaannanim) means "wanderings," or "unlading of tents," with possible reference to this nomad settlement. The LXX. render it "the oak of the covetous," because they follow another reading. In contrast with these "wandering tents" of the Bedouin, Jerusalem is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm" title="Look on Zion, the city of our solemnities: your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.">Isaiah 33:20</a> "a tent that wanders not."<p>Ewald, following the Targum, makes it mean "the plain of the swamp," and this is also found in the Talmud, which seems to indicate this place by <span class= "ital">Aquizah hak-Kedesh </span>("swamp of the holy place").<p><span class= "bld">Which is by Kedesh.</span>--Oaks and terebinths are still found abundantly in this neighbourhood; and such a green plain studded with trees would be a natural camping-ground for the Kenites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Translate, Now <span class="accented">Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites</span>, <span class="accented">viz.</span>, <span class="accented">from the sons of Hobab</span>, <span class="accented">etc. The</span> Kenites, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, had settled in the wilderness of Judah, south of Arad, in the time of Joshua. Heber, with a portion of the tribe, had migrated later to Naphtali, probably at the time When the Philistines were pressing hard upon Judah, in the days of Shamgar and Jael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a> and Judges 5:5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-16. Siser's confidence was chiefly in his chariots. But if we have ground to hope that God goes before us, we may go on with courage and cheerfulness. Be not dismayed at the difficulties thou meetest with in resisting Satan, in serving God, or suffering for him; for is not the Lord gone before thee? Follow him then fully. Barak went down, though upon the plain the iron chariots would have advantage against him: he quitted the mountain in dependence on the Divine power; for in the Lord alone is the salvation of his people, Jer 3:23. He was not deceived in his confidence. When God goes before us in our spiritual conflicts, we must bestir ourselves; and when, by his grace, he gives us some success against the enemies of our souls, we must improve it by watchfulness and resolution.</body></html>
