The Chaldee prosaically amplifies this into "she lived in Ataroth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-2.htm" title="And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looks southward:">Joshua 15:2</a>), having independent means, and she had palm-trees in Jericho, gardens in Ramah, olive-yards in the valley, a well-watered land in Bethel, and white clay in the king's mount."<p><span class= "bld">Came up.</span>--A technical term for going before a superior (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-12.htm" title="And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:">Numbers 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-7.htm" title="And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate to the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.">Deuteronomy 25:7</a>). Deborah, unlike the German Veleda--who lived in a tower, in awful seclusion--allowed the freest access to her presence as she sat beneath her palm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The palm tree of Deborah</span>. The tree, which was probably still standing in the writer's time, was known as "the palm tree of Deborah," just as a certain oak tree in the forest of Hoxne, in Suffolk, was known for many hundred years as King Edmund's oak. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-9 Deborah was a prophetess; one instructed in Divine knowledge by the inspiration of the Spirit of God. She judged Israel as God's mouth to them; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction, she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it. Barak values the satisfaction of his mind, and the good success of his enterprise, more than mere honour.</body></html>
