To make such an assumption as a way of defending an act of assassination peculiarly terrible and peculiarly treacherous seems <span class= "ital">to </span>be to the last degree unwarrantable. If any readers choose to adopt such methods for themselves they ought not to attempt the enforcement of such "private interpretations" on others. The mind which is unsophisticated by the casuistry of exegesis will find little difficulty in arriving at a fair estimate of Jael's conduct without resorting to dangerous and arbitrary interpolations of supposition into the simple Scripture narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Heber's wife.</span>--This addition, being needless, might be regarded as emphatic, and as involving an element of condemnation by calling prominent attention to the "peace between Jabin and the house of Heber," which has been mentioned where last his name occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Judges 4:17</a>). It is, however, due in all probability to the very ancient and inartificial character of the narrative.<p><span class= "bld">A nail of the tent.</span>--Probably one of the great tent-pegs used to fasten down the cords which keep the tent in its place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-19.htm" title="All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.">Exodus 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm" title="And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.">Isaiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm" title="Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations: spare not, lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes;">Isaiah 54:2</a>, &c). Josephus says an iron nail, but there is nothing to show whether it was of iron or of wood, and the LXX., by rendering it <span class= "ital">passalon </span>("a wooden plug "), seem to have understood the latter.<p><span class= "bld">An hammer.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the hammer. </span>The ponderous wooden mallet kept in every tent to beat down the cord-pegs. The word is <span class= "ital">Makkebeth, </span>from which is derived the word <span class= "ital">Maccabee. </span>The warrior-priests, to whom that title was given, were the "hammers" of their enemies, and Karl received the title of <span class= "ital">Martel </span>for a similar reason.<p><span class= "bld">Went softly unto him.</span>--So as not to awake him. The description of Sisera's murder is exceedingly graphic, but as far as the prose account of it is concerned, the silence as to any condemnation of the worst and darkest features of it by no means necessarily excludes the idea of the most complete disapproval. The method of the narrative is the same as that found in all ancient literature, and is a method wholly different from that of the moderns, which abounds in subjective reflections. Thus Homer sometimes relates an atrocity without a word of censure, and sometimes indicates disapproval by a single casual adjective.<p><span class= "bld">Smote.</span>--With more than one blow, if we take the poet's account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm" title="She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.">Judges 5:26</a>) literally.<p>Fastened it into the ground.--Rather, <span class= "ital">it </span>(the nail) <span class= "ital">went down into the around. </span>The verb used is rendered "lighted off" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm" title="And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What will you?">Judges 1:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For he was fast asleep and weary.</span>--The versions here vary considerably, but the English version seems to be perfectly correct. The verb for "he was fast asleep" is the same as in the forcible metaphor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm" title="At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.">Psalm 76:6</a> : "The horse and chariot <span class= "ital">are cast into a deep sleep." </span>The description of his one spasm of agony is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-27.htm" title="At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.">Judges 5:27</a>. There is no authority in the original for the gloss found in some MSS. of the LXX.: "And he was convulsed (<span class= "greekheb">????????????</span>) between her knees, and fainted and died." The words here used are only meant to account for his not being awakened by the approach or preparations of Jael (Kimchi), unless they involve a passing touch of pity or disapproval. Similarly it was, when Holofernes was "filled with wine," that Judith "approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head . . . and smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and she took away his head from him." (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/judith/13-2.htm" title="And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lying along upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.">Judith 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/judith/13-7.htm" title="And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.">Judith 13:7-8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jael</span>, etc. Sisera, having taken every precaution, had lain him down to rest; not, like David, trusting to the Lord to make him dwell in safety, but confiding in Jael's friendship and his own crafty directions. But no sooner had he fallen into a deep sleep, than the crafty and courageous woman, into whose hands Sisera was to be sold, took a tent pin and the heavy hammer with which they drove the pin into the ground, and with a desperate blow forced it through his temples, and pinned him to the ground. Without a struggle, he swooned and died. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">and fastened it into the ground</span>, it is better to translate, <span class="accented">that it</span> (the pin) <span class="accented">came down to the ground.</span> It is the same word as is translated <span class="accented">lighted</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-18.htm">Joshua 15:18</a>. In the last clause put the full-stop after <span class="accented">asleep</span>, and read, <span class="accented">So he swooned and died.</span> It is impossible for us to view Jael's act in the same light as her contemporaries did, on account of its treachery and cruelty; but we can admire her faith in the God of Israel, her lave for the people of God, and her marvellous courage and strength of mind in carrying out her purpose, and make allowance for the age in which she lived. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 Sisera's chariots had been his pride and his confidence. Thus are those disappointed who rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not only breaks under them, but pierces them with many sorrows. The idol may quickly become a burden, Isa 46:1; what we were sick for, God can make us sick of. It is probable that Jael really intended kindness to Sisera; but by a Divine impulse she was afterwards led to consider him as the determined enemy of the Lord and of his people, and to destroy him. All our connexions with God's enemies must be broken off, if we would have the Lord for our God, and his people for our people. He that had thought to have destroyed Israel with his many iron chariots, is himself destroyed with one iron nail. Thus the weak things of the world confound the mighty. The Israelites would have prevented much mischief, if they had sooner destroyed the Canaanites, as God commanded and enabled them: but better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience, than never be wise.</body></html>
