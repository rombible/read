Considering the allusion to the swollen waters of the Kishon and the storm in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/5-20.htm" title="They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.">Judges 5:20-22</a>, it seems probable that Josephus is following a correct Jewish tradition when he describes the battle thus:--"They joined battle, and as the ranks closed a violent storm came on, and much rain and hail; and the wind drove the rain against the faces of the Canaanites, darkening their outlook, so that their archeries and their slings were rendered useless, and their heavy-armed soldiers, because of the cold, were unable to use their swords. But since the storm was behind the Israelites, it caused them less harm, and they further took courage from their belief in God's assistance, so that, driving into the midst of the enemy, they killed many of them," &c. (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 5, ? 4). The battle thus closely resembled that of Timoleon against the Carthaginians at the Crimessus (Grote, xi. 246), and the English victory at Crecy, as has been graphically described by Dean Stanley (<span class= "ital">Jew. Church, </span>i. 329). We may add that similar conditions recurred in the battle of Cannae, except that it was the storm of <span class= "ital">dust </span>and not of rain that was blown in the faces of the Romans by the <span class= "ital">Scirocco </span>(Liv. 22:46; Plut. <span class= "ital">Fab. </span>16).<p><span class= "bld">Sisera lighted down off his chariot.</span>--We find an Homeric hero, Idaeus (<span class= "ital">Il. v.</span> 20), doing the same thing. On this the frivolous critic Zoilus made the objection, "Why did he not fly in his chariot?" The answer is the same as here: Sisera would have far more chance of escaping into concealment if he left the well-known chariot of a general. Besides this, his chariot--like those of the Egyptians at the Red Sea--was probably struggling in the trampled morass. <span class= "ital">"</span>It was left to rust on the banks of the Kishon, like Roderick's on the shores of the Guadelete" (Stanley).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">The Lord discomfited</span>, etc. Deborah had announced that the Lord was gone out before the host of Barak, and so the victory was not man's, but the Lord's. "Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-16. Siser's confidence was chiefly in his chariots. But if we have ground to hope that God goes before us, we may go on with courage and cheerfulness. Be not dismayed at the difficulties thou meetest with in resisting Satan, in serving God, or suffering for him; for is not the Lord gone before thee? Follow him then fully. Barak went down, though upon the plain the iron chariots would have advantage against him: he quitted the mountain in dependence on the Divine power; for in the Lord alone is the salvation of his people, Jer 3:23. He was not deceived in his confidence. When God goes before us in our spiritual conflicts, we must bestir ourselves; and when, by his grace, he gives us some success against the enemies of our souls, we must improve it by watchfulness and resolution.</body></html>
