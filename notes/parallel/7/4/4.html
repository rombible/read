The names of Jewish women were often derived from natural objects, as Rachel, "a lamb," Tamar,"a palm," &c. It has been sometimes regarded as a title given to her as a prophetess, just as the priestesses of Delphi were called Bees (Pindar, <span class= "ital">Pyth. iv.</span> 106); and priests were called by the title Malebee (<span class= "ital">Ess?n</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>But the fact that Rachel's nurse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm" title="But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.">Genesis 35:8</a>) had the same name is against this supposition, though Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span>, ? 5) accepts it. She had, as Cornelius a Lapide quaintly says, "a sting for foes, and honey for friends." The pronunciation Deb?rah is now so deeply-rooted in England (possibly from the Vulgate, Debbora) that it would, perhaps, be pedantic to alter it; but properly the "?" is long <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>; LXX., Deborra and Debb?ra).<p><span class= "bld">A prophetess.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a woman, a prophetess; </span>like Miriam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>), Huldah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>), Noadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>), Anna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>), &c. She is the only female judge, or, indeed, female ruler of any kind in Jewish history, except the Phoenician murderess, Athaliah. She is also the only judge to whom the title "prophet" is expressly given. "Prophetess" (like the Latin <span class= "ital">Vates</span>) implies the possession of poetic as well as of prophetic gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>); and we see her right to such a title, both in her predictions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-9.htm" title="And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.">Judges 4:9</a>), her lofty courage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm" title="The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.">Judges 5:7</a>), and the splendour of her inspired song (Judges 5). She has modern parallels in the Teutonic prophetesses, Veleda and Alaurinia (Tac., <span class= "ital">Germ. </span>8), and Joan of Arc, the "Inspired Maid of Domremi." Among the Jews prophetesses were the exception; among the ancient Germans they were the rule.<p><span class= "bld">The wife of Lapidoth.</span>--This is probably the meaning of the phrase, although some ancient commentators make it mean "a woman of Lapidoth;" as does Tennyson (<span class= "ital">Princess</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>"Like that great dame of Lapidoth." The phrase closely resembles "Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron," "Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum." The name Lapidoth, which occurs nowhere else, means "flames," "lamps," or "splendours;" and Rashi says that she was called "a woman of lamps," from making the wicks for the lamps of the sanctuary; while others, with equal improbability, interpret it of her shining gifts and of her fiery spirit. The parallels which are adduced to support this view (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-1.htm" title="For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burns.">Isaiah 62:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm" title="Can you put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?">Job 41:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-5.htm" title="He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defense shall be prepared.">Nahum 2:5</a>) are inadequate; as also is Ecclus. xlviii. 1, "The word of Elias burnt like a torch;" and the Midrash, which says of Phinehas, that "when the Holy Ghost filled him, his countenance glowed like torches" (Cassel). Perhaps there was a fancy that such a prophetess could only be a virgin. The name Lapidoth has a feminine termination, but this does not prove that it may not have been, like Naboth, Shelomith, Koheleth, &c., the name of a man. It is uncertain whether Deborah was of the tribe of Ephraim or Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-15.htm" title="And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.">Judges 5:15</a>; Ewald, ii. 489).<p><span class= "bld">She judged Israel.</span>--We see from the next verse that up to this time her functions had mainly consisted of peaceful arbitration and legal decision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm" title="If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-9 Deborah was a prophetess; one instructed in Divine knowledge by the inspiration of the Spirit of God. She judged Israel as God's mouth to them; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction, she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it. Barak values the satisfaction of his mind, and the good success of his enterprise, more than mere honour.</body></html>
