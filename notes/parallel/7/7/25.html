Such names are common among nomads. The capture of these two powerful sheykhs was the result of the second part of the battle, and was not accomplished without a terrible slaughter. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-9.htm" title="They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.">Psalm 73:9-12</a>, where the word rendered "houses" of God should be "pastures" of God. It is remarkable that in this passage there seems to be almost an identification of the victories of Barak and Gideon, as though they were the result of one great combined movement. In the phrase "became as the dung of the earth" we see that tradition preserved a memory of the fertilisation of the ground by the dead bodies (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-16.htm" title="But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell on the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.">Judges 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm" title="The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, you have trodden down strength.">Judges 5:21</a>). The completeness of the victory is also ailuded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-4.htm" title="Lift up your eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to you: your sons shall come from far, and your daughters shall be nursed at your side.">Isaiah 60:4</a> : "Thou hast broken the yoke of his burden . . . as in the day of Midian"; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm" title="And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was on the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:26</a>. The brief narrative of Judges perhaps hardly enables us to realise the three acts of this great tragedy of Midianite slaughter--at Gilboa, the Fords, and Karkor.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the rock Oreb.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">at the raven's rock. </span>Only again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm" title="And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was on the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:26</a> : "according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb." Reland identifies it with Orbo, near Bethshean.<p><span class= "bld">To Gideon on the other side Jordan.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, beyond the Jordan ("trans fluenta Jordani," Vulg.). This notice is given by anticipation, for Gideon's crossing the Jordan is not mentioned till <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm" title="And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.">Judges 8:4</a>. The words literally mean <span class= "ital">"from </span>beyond the Jordan," as the LXX. render them (<span class= "ital">apo peran</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but this is idiomatic for <span class= "ital">"from </span>one place to another," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-22.htm" title="Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.">Joshua 13:22</a>, &c-<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oreb,</span> a raven, and <span class="cmt_word">Zeeb,</span> a wolf. The rock known afterwards as the <span class="accented">rock of Oreb</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>), and the wine-press (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>) known as the <span class="accented">wine-press of Zeeb</span>, were so called from being the places where these two princes were taken and slain by the Eph-raimites. In like manner the <span class="accented">well of Harod</span> is called by the name it afterwards received (ver. 1), and the <span class="accented">palm tree of Deborah</span> in like manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-5.htm">Judges 2:5</a>), and <span class="accented">Lehi</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-9.htm">Judges 15:9</a>). These are valuable indications (to which many more might be added) of a living tradition older than the written history. The capture of Oreb and Zeeb is celebrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-11.htm">Psalm 83:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>. On the other side Jordan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the east side of the river, which Gideon had now crossed, as is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>. The narrative runs on here to complete the history of the doings of the men of Ephraim, and goes back at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a> to take up the thread of the history of Gideon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-6</a>, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:23-25 Two chief commanders of the host of Midian were taken and slain by the men of Ephraim. It were to be wished that we all did as these did, and that where help is needed, that it were willingly and readily performed by another. And that if there were any excellent and profitable matter begun, we were willing to have fellow-labourers to the finishing and perfecting the same, and not, as often, hinder one another.</body></html>
