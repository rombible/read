and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.">Genesis 41:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm" title="And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.">Numbers 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm" title="And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.">1Samuel 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>, &c.), Gideon would feel doubly assured.<p><span class= "bld">A cake.</span>--The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">tsalol </span>(or <span class= "ital">tselil </span>in the Keri, or margin) is a word which occurs nowhere else. Rabbis Kimchi and Tanchun derive it from <span class= "ital">tsalal, </span>"he tinkled" (as in <span class= "ital">tselselim </span>and other names for musical instruments), or "he overshadowed." Neither derivation yields any sense. The Chaldee, Syriac, and Rashi render it "a cake baked on coals," and so, too, the LXX. (since such is the meaning of <span class= "ital">magie</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the Vulgate (<span class= "ital">panis subcinericius</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and Josephus (<span class= "ital">maza krithin?</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>this seems to be the true sense. Ewald makes it mean "a dry rattling crust." Niebuhr tells us that the desert Arabs thrust a round lump of dough into hot ashes, then take it out and eat it. (<span class= "ital">Arab., </span>p. 52.)<p><span class= "bld">Of barley bread.</span>--Josephus helps us to see the significance of the symbol by adding, "which men can (hardly) eat for its coarseness." It must be remembered that the Israelites had been reduced to such poverty by these raids that the mass of them would have nothing to subsist on but common barley bread such as that used to this day, with bitter complaints, by the Fellahin of Palestine. Among the Greeks also <span class= "ital">"</span>barley bread" was proverbial as a kind of food hardly fit to be eaten, although such was the poverty which the Saviour bore for our sakes that it seems to have been the ordinary food of Him and His apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm" title="There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?">John 6:9</a>). "A cake of barley bread" would, therefore, naturally recall the thought of the Israelites, who were no doubt taunted by their enemies with being reduced to this food; just as Dr. Johnson defined oats as "food for horses in England, and for men in Scotland." Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-28.htm" title="Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.">1Kings 4:28</a>, the "barley" is only for the horses and dromedaries. "If the Midianites were accustomed to call Gideon and his band 'eaters of barley bread,' as their successors, the haughty Bedouins, often do to ridicule their enemies, the application would be the more natural" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">Land and Book, </span>p. 447). Josephus makes the soldier say that, as barley is the vilest of all seed, so the Israelites were the vilest of all the people of Asia.<p><span class= "bld">Tumbled.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">was rolling itself.</span><p><span class= "bld">Unto a tent.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">into the tent, </span>which doubtless means (as Josephus says) the tent-royal--the tent of Zebah and Salmanah.<p><span class= "bld">Smote it.--</span>Perhaps the dream involved that it also (as Josephus says) "threw down the tents of all the soldiers."<p><span class= "bld">Overturned it, that the tent lay along.</span>--The latter words are involved in the first verb, and are only added for emphasis in accordance with the full picturesque Hebrew style. (Comp. "A bullock that hath horns and hoofs;" "I am a widow woman, and my husband is dead," &c.) This leisurely stateliness of description is found again and again in the Bible. (See my <span class= "ital">Origin of Language, </span>p. 168, and<span class= "ital"> Brief Greek Syntax, </span>p. 200.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A cake</span>. The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else. <span class="cmt_word">Of barley bread</span>. The commonest kind of bread, the food of only the poorer classes, indicating, therefore, the humble origin and station of Gideon. <span class="cmt_word">A tent</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">the tent</span>; what in a Roman camp would be the <span class="accented">pretorium</span>, the general's tent. The words at the end of the verse are heaped up to indicate the total and entire upsetting and overthrow of the tent, symbolic of the rout and destruction of the Midianite host. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:9-15 The dream seemed to have little meaning in it; but the interpretation evidently proved the whole to be from the Lord, and discovered that the name of Gideon had filled the Midianites with terror. Gideon took this as a sure pledge of success; without delay he worshipped and praised God, and returned with confidence to his three hundred men. Wherever we are, we may speak to God, and worship him. God must have the praise of that which encourages our faith. And his providence must be acknowledged in events, though small and seemingly accidental.</body></html>
