The fact that this Bath Kol echoed the promise which Gideon had already received (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-9.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, get you down to the host; for I have delivered it into your hand.">Judges 7:9</a>) would give it additional force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is nothing else</span>, etc. The dream and the interpretation are striking evidences of the terror which Gideon's name had already inspired among the Midianites. Because, although both the dream and the interpretation were of God, for the encouragement of Gideon in his great undertaking, yet they followed the course of nature and the laws of psychology. The presentiment that God had delivered Midian into Gideon's hand is exactly like the terror in the minds of the Canaanites which preceded the arrival of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:9-15 The dream seemed to have little meaning in it; but the interpretation evidently proved the whole to be from the Lord, and discovered that the name of Gideon had filled the Midianites with terror. Gideon took this as a sure pledge of success; without delay he worshipped and praised God, and returned with confidence to his three hundred men. Wherever we are, we may speak to God, and worship him. God must have the praise of that which encourages our faith. And his providence must be acknowledged in events, though small and seemingly accidental.</body></html>
