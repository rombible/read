And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.">Judges 7:3</a>), to which there may be again an allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-5.htm" title="And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.">1Samuel 28:5</a>. The name is here used by anticipation. It occurs here only, though two <span class= "ital">Harodites </span>are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-25.htm" title="Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,">2Samuel 23:25</a>; and the same fountain is obviously alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.">1Samuel 29:1</a>. From the fact that Gideon's camp was on Mount Gilboa there can be little doubt that Harod must be identified with the abundant and beautiful fountain at the foot of the hill now known as <span class= "ital">Ain Jal-d, </span>or "the spring of Goliath," from a mistaken legend that this was the scene of the giant's death; or possibly from a mistaken corruption of the name Harod itself. There is another reading, "Endor" (comp. Ps. 82:10).<p><span class= "bld">By the hill of Moreh.</span>--Bertheau renders it, "stretching from the hill of Moreh into the valley." The only hill of this name which we know from other sources is that at Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm" title="Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>), but that is twenty-five miles south of Mount Gilboa. There can be no doubt that Moreh is here used for Little Hermon, now Jebel ed-Duhy. The Vulgate renders it "of a lofty hill," perhaps to avoid a supposed difficulty. The word Moreh means "archer," and Little Hermon may have been called "the Archer's Hill," from the bowmen of the Amalekites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerubbaal</span>. The mention of this name seems intended to keep before our minds that it is emphatically the servant of the Lord who is going forth to victory. <span class="cmt_word">The well of Harod</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of <span class="accented">trembling</span>, so called, no doubt, from the incident recorded in ver. 3, that every one who was <span class="accented">afraid</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">hated</span>) departed from Mount Gilead. The well of <span class="accented">Harod</span> is not mentioned elsewhere, though two of David's mighty men are called Harodites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-25.htm">2 Samuel 23:25</a>); but it is thought to be identical with "the fountain which is in Jezreel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>), on the slope of Mount Gilboa, and now called <span class="accented">Ain Jahlood</span>, the spring of Goliah. <span class="cmt_word">On the north side</span>, etc. Gideon and his Abi-ezrites were naturally on the south side of the plain, on the hill, apparently Mount Gilboa, which there shuts in the plain. The Midianitc host was encamped to the north of him (so it is in the Hebrew), in the valley, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the plain of Jezreel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">By the hill of Moreh</span>. Nowhere else mentioned; probably only a hillock, of which there are many in that part of the plain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-8. God provides that the praise of victory may be wholly to himself, by appointing only three hundred men to be employed. Activity and prudence go with dependence upon God for help in our lawful undertakings. When the Lord sees that men would overlook him, and through unbelief, would shrink from perilous services, or that through pride they would vaunt themselves against him, he will set them aside, and do his work by other instruments. Pretences will be found by many, for deserting the cause and escaping the cross. But though a religious society may thus be made fewer in numbers, yet it will gain as to purity, and may expect an increased blessing from the Lord. God chooses to employ such as are not only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. They grudged not at the liberty of the others who were dismissed. In doing the duties required by God, we must not regard the forwardness or backwardness of others, nor what they do, but what God looks for at our hands. He is a rare person who can endure that others should excel him in gifts or blessings, or in liberty; so that we may say, it is by the special grace of God that we regard what God says to us, and not look to men what they do.</body></html>
