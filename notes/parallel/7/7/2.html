bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomsoever I say to you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.">Judges 7:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Lest Israel vaunt themselves.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-17.htm" title="And you say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.">Deuteronomy 8:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said</span>, etc. It must be remembered that this whole movement was essentially a religious one. It began with prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6, 7</a>), it was followed up by repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-27.htm">Judges 6:27, 28</a>), and the great purpose of it was to turn the hearts of the nation back to the God of their fathers. The Lord himself, therefore, graciously forwarded this end by making it plain that the deliverance from their oppression was his work, and his only. For the general sentiment compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-6.htm">Zechariah 3:6</a>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-8. God provides that the praise of victory may be wholly to himself, by appointing only three hundred men to be employed. Activity and prudence go with dependence upon God for help in our lawful undertakings. When the Lord sees that men would overlook him, and through unbelief, would shrink from perilous services, or that through pride they would vaunt themselves against him, he will set them aside, and do his work by other instruments. Pretences will be found by many, for deserting the cause and escaping the cross. But though a religious society may thus be made fewer in numbers, yet it will gain as to purity, and may expect an increased blessing from the Lord. God chooses to employ such as are not only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. They grudged not at the liberty of the others who were dismissed. In doing the duties required by God, we must not regard the forwardness or backwardness of others, nor what they do, but what God looks for at our hands. He is a rare person who can endure that others should excel him in gifts or blessings, or in liberty; so that we may say, it is by the special grace of God that we regard what God says to us, and not look to men what they do.</body></html>
