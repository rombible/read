The tremendous tragedy of their flight can only be appreciated by the vivid impression which it made on the national imagination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm" title="For you have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.">Isaiah 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm" title="And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was on the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:26</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/83-13.htm" title="O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.">Psalm 83:13-14</a>, it is compared to the whirling flight of dry weeds before a rush of flame and wind, recalling the Arab imprecation, "May you be whirled like the akukb ('wild artichoke,' 'a wheel,' 'a rolling thing') before the wind, until you are caught in the thorns or plunged into the sea" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">Land and Book, </span>Judges 36).<p><span class= "bld">Beth-shittah.</span>--It should be rather, <span class= "ital">Beth hash-shit-tah, </span>"the house of the acacia"--a place named from the trees which are still abundant in that neighbourhood, just as we have such names as Burntash, Seven-oaks, Nine Elms, &c. (Comp. Abel-Shittim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-49.htm" title="And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.">Numbers 33:49</a>; Joshua 21.) If <span class= "ital">Beth hash-shittah </span>was the village <span class= "ital">Shultah, </span>with which Robinson (<span class= "ital">Bibl. Reg., </span>3:219) identifies it, some of the host must have fled northwards. It is improbable that it was another name for Beth-shean, though the LXX. have Bethsead in some MSS. It is, however, by no means unlikely that some of the marauders would fly towards the fords of the Jordan near Bethshean (comp. Jos. <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 6, ? 5), as others fled south to the fords near Succoth, which lay to the south of the Jabbok.<p><span class= "bld">In.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">towards, </span>as in the margin.<p><span class= "bld">Zererath.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Zererah. </span>This is omitted in the Vulgate; the LXX. have the extraordinary reading <span class= "ital">Tagaragatha, </span>or in some MSS. "and he led them." The final <span class= "ital">th </span>is no part of the name, but the mode of connecting the name with the particle of motion. Zererath is not again mentioned, but the distinction between the Hebrew letters <span class= "ital">r </span>(<span class= "greekheb"></span>) and <span class= "ital">d </span>(<span class= "greekheb"></span>) is so slight that the reading <span class= "ital">Zeredath </span>may here be correct; and if so, it may be the Zeredath in Ephraim, which was the birthplace of Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm" title="And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.">1Kings 11:26</a>), and the Zaretan of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm" title="That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up on an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.">Joshua 3:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm" title="In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.">1Kings 7:46</a>, which is sixteen miles north of Jericho.<p><span class= "bld">To the border.</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">to the lip, </span>or <span class= "ital">brink, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-30.htm" title="And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.">Exodus 4:30</a>. It does not, however, necessarily prove that Abel-meholah was on the edge of the Jordan valley.<p><span class= "bld">Abel-meholah.</span>--"The meadow of the dance." It was in Ephraim, and was the native place of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>; see, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm" title="Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:">1Kings 4:12</a>). Eusebius and Jerome place it ten miles south of Bethshean, at Wady Maleb. <span class= "ital">Abel </span>means "a moist, grassy meadow."<p><span class= "bld">Unto Tabbath.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">upon Tabbath. </span>The name seems to mean "famous," but the site is unknown, unless it be the remarkable bank called <span class= "ital">Tubukhat Fahil,</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blew the trumpets</span>, etc. Hearing the confusion, the three companies blew their trumpets, probably more loudly than before, to give the impression of a hot pursuit being at hand. The Midianites, thinking the enemy were upon them, and not being able in the dark to distinguish friend from foe, mistook their flying comrades for pursuing Israelites, and fell upon and slew one another. In like manner the Philistines had done when attacked by Jonathan and his armour-bearer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>), and the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites when attacked by Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shittah</span>. House of acacias. The exact situation of it, and of Zererath and Tabbath, is unknown. They must have been villages lying on the route from the plain of Esdraelon to the banks of Jordan, probably between Little Hermon on the north and Mount Gilboa on the south, where there was a very ancient high road from Jezreel to the Jordan by Beth-sham Indeed it is highly probable that <span class="accented">Shuta</span>, a village mentioned by Robinson, marks the site, as it retains the name of Beth-shittah. For <span class="cmt_word">Zererath</span> some read, with some of the old versions and manuscripts, <span class="accented">Zeredath</span> (<span class="accented">r</span> and <span class="accented">d</span> being scarcely distinguishable in Hebrew), and identify it with <span class="accented">Zarthan</span> near Succoth, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Abel-meholah</span> (the meadow of the dance) was the birthplace of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>), and is mentioned in conjunction with Beth-shan, Jezreel, and Zartana in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>. Eusebius tells us that in his time Abel-meholah was called Beth-maiela, and situated ten miles below Beth-shan, or Scy-thopolis. There was also, he says, close by an <span class="accented">Abel-maiela.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:16-22 This method of defeating the Midianites may be alluded to, as exemplifying the destruction of the devil's kingdom in the world, by the preaching of the everlasting gospel, the sounding that trumpet, and the holding forth that light out of earthen vessels, for such are the ministers of the gospel, 2Co 4:6,7. God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, a barley-cake to overthrow the tents of Midian, that the excellency of the power might be of God only. The gospel is a sword, not in the hand, but in the mouth: the sword of the Lord and of Gideon; of God and Jesus Christ, of Him that sits on the throne and the Lamb. The wicked are often led to avenge the cause of God upon each other, under the power of their delusions, and the fury of their passions. See also how God often makes the enemies of the church instruments to destroy one another; it is a pity that the church's friends should ever act like them.</body></html>
