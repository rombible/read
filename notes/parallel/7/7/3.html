It is there founded on the psychological observation that cowardice is exceedingly contagious, so that the presence of timid men in an army is a source of direct danger. The same rule was rigidly observed by the faithful Judas Maccabaeus (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-56.htm" title="But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law.">1 Maccabees 3:56</a>). Epaminondas, for the same reason, made the same proclamation before the battle of Leuctra. In this instance there was the further reason given in the previous verse. "The ancients had observed that even when there are many legions it is always the few that win the battle" (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. xiv.</span> 36).<p><span class= "bld">Depart early.</span>--The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">tsaphar </span>occurs here only. The Chaldee explains it by <span class= "ital">tsiphra, </span>"in the morning;" and Abarband says that this injunction was given in order that they might not incur shame when they retired. The rendering "hastily" is explained to mean "like a bird" (<span class= "ital">tsippor</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Keil, connecting it with an Arabic root, makes it mean "slink away by bye-paths." It seems to involve a shade of contempt--"Let him take himself off." (<span class= "ital">Trolle </span>sich: Cassel.)<p><span class= "bld">From mount Gilead.</span>--This expression has caused great difficulty, but the Hebrew cannot mean <span class= "ital">"to </span>mount Gilead," nor yet "<span class= "ital">beyond </span>mount Gilead." The only tenable solution of the difficulty is, (1) to alter the text into "mount Gilboa" (Clericus), or from <span class= "ital">meehar, </span>"from mount," to <span class= "ital">maheer, </span>"speedily" (Michaelis); or (2) to suppose that "mount Gilead" was a rallying-cry of the Manassites in general, for Gilead was a son of Abiezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-30.htm" title="These are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites: of Helek, the family of the Helekites:">Numbers 26:30</a>, where Jeezer is merely an error); and hence was derived the name "Gilead" of the trans-Jordanic district which fell to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/17-5.htm" title="And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;">Joshua 17:5-6</a>). If this be a true conjecture, the phrase "let him depart from mount Gilead" means "let him leave the camp of Manasseh." One more conjecture is that Gilead is an ancient name for Gilboa (Schwarz).<p><span class= "bld">There returned of the people twenty and two thousand.</span>--No detail could more decisively show the terror struck into them by the sight of the Midianite host. They looked on them with the same alarm with which the Greeks, before Marathon, used to gaze on the Persian dress. It must not, however, be supposed that all the defaulters went straight to their homes. Doubtless many of them took part in the pursuit which made the victory decisive.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">Depart early</span>. The Hebrew word so rendered only occurs here. Its exact meaning is uncertain, but the old versions generally give the meaning of "depart," "go back." Some, with much probability, connect the word with the Hebr<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-8. God provides that the praise of victory may be wholly to himself, by appointing only three hundred men to be employed. Activity and prudence go with dependence upon God for help in our lawful undertakings. When the Lord sees that men would overlook him, and through unbelief, would shrink from perilous services, or that through pride they would vaunt themselves against him, he will set them aside, and do his work by other instruments. Pretences will be found by many, for deserting the cause and escaping the cross. But though a religious society may thus be made fewer in numbers, yet it will gain as to purity, and may expect an increased blessing from the Lord. God chooses to employ such as are not only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. They grudged not at the liberty of the others who were dismissed. In doing the duties required by God, we must not regard the forwardness or backwardness of others, nor what they do, but what God looks for at our hands. He is a rare person who can endure that others should excel him in gifts or blessings, or in liberty; so that we may say, it is by the special grace of God that we regard what God says to us, and not look to men what they do.</body></html>
