<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-11.htm" title="And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the middle of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.">1Samuel 11:11</a>). The subsequent division into four watches of three hours each was borrowed from the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm" title="And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.">Matthew 14:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-48.htm" title="And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.">Mark 6:48</a>).

"just in rousing they roused the watch." The attack took place at the moment of confusion caused by changing the watch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The middle watch</span>. The ancient Israelites divided the night into three watches of four hours each, from sunset to sunrise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from six p.m. to six a.m. The first watch, from six to ten, is not mentioned in the Old Testament; but we have the <span class="accented">middle</span> watch mentioned here (from ten to two), and the <span class="accented">morning watch</span> (from two till six): <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>. According to this, Gideon's attack would have taken place soon after ten p.m., or towards eleven, the time when the sleep would be the deepest, the watchmen of the first watch having lately fallen into their first sleep. The later Israelites adopted the Roman division of the night into four watches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-38.htm">Luke 12:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:16-22 This method of defeating the Midianites may be alluded to, as exemplifying the destruction of the devil's kingdom in the world, by the preaching of the everlasting gospel, the sounding that trumpet, and the holding forth that light out of earthen vessels, for such are the ministers of the gospel, 2Co 4:6,7. God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, a barley-cake to overthrow the tents of Midian, that the excellency of the power might be of God only. The gospel is a sword, not in the hand, but in the mouth: the sword of the Lord and of Gideon; of God and Jesus Christ, of Him that sits on the throne and the Lamb. The wicked are often led to avenge the cause of God upon each other, under the power of their delusions, and the fury of their passions. See also how God often makes the enemies of the church instruments to destroy one another; it is a pity that the church's friends should ever act like them.</body></html>
