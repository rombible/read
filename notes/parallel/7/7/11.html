For a similar instance see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm" title="And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.">1Samuel 14:6</a> (Jonathan and his armour-bearer). The word is used in slightly different senses. Sometimes it means a voice from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>, &c): such voices from heaven are described in the Talmud; sometimes it means the first chance words which a man hears after being bidden to look out for them as a Divine intimation; sometimes it means an actual echo (see Hamburger's <span class= "ital">Talmud. W</span>�<span class= "ital">rterb., s.5</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>It was one of the four recognised modes of Divine direction (viz., prophets, dreams, Urim, and the Bath Kol, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/28-6.htm" title="And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.">1Samuel 28:6-15</a>), but stood lowest of the four. It was also known to the Greeks, among whom the oracle sometimes bade a man to take as his answer the first casual words which he heard spoken on leaving the Temple.<p><span class= "bld">The armed men.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">ranks by, five, </span>the word (<span class= "ital">chamooshim</span>) rendered "harnessed" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm" title="But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 13:18</a>, "armed" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-14.htm" title="Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but you shall pass before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;">Joshua 1:14</a>. Probably here the word means "foreposts," or "sentries"; and the Vulgate renders it "vigiliae." The LXX. curiously render it "<span class= "ital">to </span>the beginning," (or in other MSS.) "to part of <span class= "ital">the fifty," </span>following a wrong punctuation.<p><span class= "bld">That were in the host.</span>--Probably "the host" was in some respects more like a temporary nomad migration, such as is so common among all wandering tribes. If so, it would not be by any means entirely composed of "armed men," but would, like the Persians under Xerxes, trail with it a vast mass of camp followers, &c., who would probably be encamped in the centre with the baggage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The armed men</span>.

These fighting men, as distinguished from the numbers of the nomads who were with their camels and cattle scattered all along the plain, were all collected in the camp, to the edge of which Gideon and Phurah crept stealthily in the dark. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:9-15 The dream seemed to have little meaning in it; but the interpretation evidently proved the whole to be from the Lord, and discovered that the name of Gideon had filled the Midianites with terror. Gideon took this as a sure pledge of success; without delay he worshipped and praised God, and returned with confidence to his three hundred men. Wherever we are, we may speak to God, and worship him. God must have the praise of that which encourages our faith. And his providence must be acknowledged in events, though small and seemingly accidental.</body></html>
