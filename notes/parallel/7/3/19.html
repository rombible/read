The rendering, <span class= "ital">"</span>stone quarries," is derived from the Chaldee and Rabbi Jarchi; but it probably means idols of some kind--probably those of Moab. Some explain it of the twelve stones which were taken out of Jordan, and pitched at Gilgal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-2.htm" title="Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,">Joshua 4:2</a>). The LXX. (in some MSS.) make it mean that <span class= "ital">Eglon </span>returned, but this is clearly a mistake. Gilgal was near Jericho, and when Ehud had accompanied his comrades to some well-known landmark at Gilgal, he returned to Jericho. Josephus says he had "two attendants" with him; but the word "people" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-18.htm" title="And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.">Judges 3:18</a> implies that many more had accompanied him.<p><span class= "bld">By Gilgal.</span>--Ewald thinks that Gilgal belonged to Ephraim, and that "he went to see if all was safe at this frontier-post." If the <span class= "ital">pesilim </span>were sacred stones to mark a boundary (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm" title="She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.">Judges 5:26</a>), they would, like the Greek Hermae, have been condemned by the Jews as idolatrous.<p><span class= "bld">I have a secret errand unto thee, O king.</span>--Something in Ehud's position and antecedents enabled him to reckon on the king's credulity. Eglon, aware of discontent among the Israelites, may have supposed that Ehud had some secret to betray. Similarly Darius obtained an interview with the Pseudo-Smerdis, for the purpose of assassinating him, by pretending to have a secret message to him; and, in explaining it to his comrade, says, "When lying is necessary, lie" (Herod, iii. 72). In Josephus's version of the story, Ehud pretends that he has a <span class= "ital">dream </span>to narrate.<p><span class= "bld">Who said, Keep silence.</span>--Rather, "And he said, <span class= "ital">Hush!" </span>(Heb., Has.) The narrative is very graphic, but it does not appear whether the "Hush!" was addressed to Ehud, to prevent him from saying any more in the presence of the attendants, or as an intimation to the attendants to retire. They at once understood that the king wished to be left alone.<p><span class= "bld">All that stood by him.</span>--Courtiers always <span class= "ital">stand </span>in the presence of Eastern kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The quarries</span>. It is uncertain whether this is the meaning of the Hebrew word. Its common meaning is <span class="accented">images</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, and elsewhere. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-30 When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
