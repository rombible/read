The verb "possessed" by no means implies that the whole city was necessarily re-built, still less that it was fortified.

The Amalekites appear, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>, to have been a branch of the Edomites, and the latest mention of them in the Bible finds a remnant of them in the neighbourhood of Mount Seir in the days of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41-43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The city of palm trees</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jericho, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>.

Though no longer a fenced city, it was important from the fertility of the plain, and from its commanding the fords. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-30 When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
