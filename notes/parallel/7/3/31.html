We know nothing of Shamgar's tribe or family, but, as neither his name nor that of his father is Jewish, it has been conjectured that he may have been a Kenite; a conjecture which derives some confirmation from his juxtaposition with Jael in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Judges 5:6</a>. Shamgar means "name of a stranger" (comp. Grershom, "a stranger there"). Samgar-Nebo is the name of a Babylonian general (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Six hundred men.</span>--It has been most needlessly assumed that he slew them single-handed, and not, as is probable, at the head of a band of peasants armed with the same rude weapons as himself. If he slew 600 with his own hand, the <span class= "ital">whole </span>number that perished would almost certainly have been added. There is, indeed, no impossibility (even apart from Divine assistance, which is implied though not expressly attributed to him) in the supposition that in a battle which may have lasted for more than one day a single chief may with his own hand have killed this number, for we are told that in a night battle against Moawijah, Ali raised a shout each time he had killed an enemy, and his voice was heard 300 times in one night; and a story closely resembling that of Shamgar is narrated of a Swedish peasant; but the question here is merely one of interpretation, and nothing is more common in Scripture, as in all literature, than to say that a leader personally did what was done under his leadership, <span class= "ital">e.g., "</span>Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-7.htm" title="And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.">1Samuel 18:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">With an ox goad.</span>--The LXX. (Codex B) and Vulgate have "with a ploughshare;" and the Alexandrian Codex of the LXX. renders it "besides the oxen." These translations are not tenable. The phrase occurs here alone--<span class= "ital">bemalmad ha b?k?r; </span>literally, "with a thing to teach oxen." There can be little doubt that an ox-goad is meant. In the East they are sometimes formidable implements, eight feet long, pointed with a strong sharp iron head. The use of them--since whips were not used for cattle--is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm" title="Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.">1Samuel 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm" title="And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 9:5</a>. Being disarmed, the Israelites would be unable to find any more effective weapon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Judges 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-8.htm" title="They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?">Judges 5:8</a>). Disarmament was the universal policy of ancient days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm" title="Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:">1Samuel 13:19</a>); and this reduced the Israelites to the use of inventive skill in very simple weapons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-40.htm" title="And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a money; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.">1Samuel 17:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm" title="And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.">1Samuel 17:43</a>). Samson had nothing better than the jawbone of an ass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-15.htm" title="And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.">Judges 15:15</a>). Similarly the Thracian king Lycurgus is said to have chased the Bacchanals with an ox-goad (<span class= "ital">bouplegi, II. </span>vi. 134), and that in this very neighbourhood ("near Carmel," Nonnus, <span class= "ital">Dionys. </span>20). The Athenians, in their painting of Marathon, in the P?cile, represented the gigantic rustic, Echetlus, who was supposed to have slain so many of the Persians, with his ploughshare (Pausan. i. 15, ? 4). Comp. Hom. <span class= "ital">Iliad, vi.</span> 134.<p><span class= "bld">He also delivered Israel.</span>--Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 4, ? 3), following some Jewish <span class= "ital">hagadah, </span>says that Shamgar was chosen judge, but died in the first year of his office. This may have been a mere inference, from his being passed over in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.">Judges 4:1</a>. He does not mention his deed of prowess.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of the Philistines</span>. This is an isolated movement of the Philistines, alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11</a>, but of which we have no further details. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a> we read of Israel worshipping the gods of the Phllistines, and of an alliance between the Ammonites and Philistines to vex Israel; but the precise connection between the events of the two chapters, or the exact time when either occurred, cannot be determined with certainty. Nothing more is known of Shamgar, except the mention of him in Deborah's song (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:31 The side of the country which lay south-west, was infested by the Philistines. God raised up Shamgar to deliver them; having neither sword nor spear, he took an ox-goad, the instrument next at hand. God can make those serviceable to his glory and to his church's good, whose birth, education, and employment, are mean and obscure. It is no matter what the weapon is, if God directs and strengthens the arm. Often he works by unlikely means, that the excellency of the power may appear to be of God.</body></html>
