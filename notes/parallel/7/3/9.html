Josephus, to escape the apparent improbability of a brother of Caleb being young enough to marry Caleb's daughter, when Caleb was past eighty-five, calls him "a person of the tribe of Judah." He rightly regards the events of Judges 17-21 as preceding the judgeship of Othniel; but they can hardly have happened during the oppression of Cushan-Rishathaim.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A deliverer</span>. Hebrew, <span class="accented">Saviour</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> ver. 15 (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Othniel</span>, etc. Mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-13.htm">1 Chronicles 4:13</a>, where he is placed under "the sons of Kenaz," and seems to be the father of Hathath and Meonothai. According to Judith 6:15, he had a descendant, <span class="accented">Chabris</span>, living in the time of Holofernes. The Hebrew, though grammatically it favours the view that Othniel was the brother of Caleb, does not absolutely exclude the rendering that Kenaz was his brother, and so Othniel his nephew. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7</a>, where the words "thine uncle" apply to Shallum, not to Hanameel, as is clear from ver. 8. And as the chronology seems to make it impossible that Othniel should be Caleb's brother, since Caleb was eighty-five years old at the time of Othniel's marriage, and Othniel therefore could not be less than fifty-five, an improbable age for his marriage; and since, again, Othniel could not well have been less than eighty at Joshua's death, which, allowing only ten years for the elders, and reckoning the eight years for Chushan's dominion, would make him ninety-eight when he was raised up to deliver Israel, it is a lesser difficulty to take Othniel as the nephew of Caleb, by understanding the words, <span class="accented">Caleb's younger brother</span>, to apply to Kenaz. But perhaps the least objectionable escape from the difficulty is to take the phrase in its most natural grammatical sense, but to understand the word <span class="accented">brother</span> in its wider and very common sense of <span class="accented">kinsman</span> or <span class="accented">fellow-tribesman.</span> They were both sons of Kenaz, or Kenizzites. Caleb was the head of the tribe, and Othniel was next to him in tribal dignity, and his junior in age, but probably succeeded to the chieftainship on Caleb's death. This would leave the exact relationship between Caleb and Othniel uncertain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 The first judge was Othniel: even in Joshua's time Othniel began to be famous. Soon after Israel's settlement in Canaan their purity began to be corrupted, and their peace disturbed. But affliction makes those cry to God who before would scarcely speak to him. God returned in mercy to them for their deliverance. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel. The Spirit of wisdom and courage to qualify him for the service, and the Spirit of power to excite him to it. He first judged Israel, reproved and reformed them, and then went to war. Let sin at home be conquered, that worst of enemies, then enemies abroad will be more easily dealt with. Thus let Christ be our Judge and Lawgiver, then he will save us.</body></html>
