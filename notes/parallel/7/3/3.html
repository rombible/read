The word rendered "lords" is evidently a technical or local <span class= "ital">title--Seranim. </span>It is rendered by the LXX. <span class= "ital">"satrapies," </span>and by the Vulgate, "satraps." It is variously derived from <span class= "ital">seren, </span>"a hinge" (comp. "cardinal" from "cardo"); from <span class= "ital">sar, </span>"a prince," being interchanged with <span class= "ital">sarim, </span>in 1 Sam. 13:30; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-6.htm" title="Then Achish called David, and said to him, Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords favor you not.">1Samuel 29:6</a> (Ewald, i. 332); and from some Ph?nician root. For the Philistines, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.">Judges 13:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">All the Canaanites.</span>--Of the <span class= "ital">sheph?lah </span>or maritime plain.<p><span class= "bld">The Sidonians.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm" title="And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,">Genesis 10:15</a> "Sidon" is the eldest son of Canaan.

The name has been derived from <span class= "ital">Havvah, </span>a circular encampment or village, because they lived (as they do to this day in northern Syria) in circular villages, with enclosures for cattle in the centre. Ewald ( i. 318) supposes that the word means "midlanders," and Gesenius "villagers."

It was probably a temple of Baal, but must be farther south than Baalbek. The hill of Paneas is therefore, in all probability, " <span class= "ital">Mount </span>Baal-hermon," and Baal-hermon may be only another name for Baal-gad.

It occurs repeatedly in ch. 16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5, 6, 29</a>, etc. The word means an <span class="accented">axle-tree. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The entering in of Hamath</span>. There are two theories in regard to Hamath. Some, as Professor Rawlinson in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' identify it with <span class="accented">Hamah</span>, a large and important city on the Orontes in Upper Syria, and consider <span class="accented">that</span> the kingdom of Hamath, which was overthrown by the king of Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>), and of which Hamath was the capital, was for the most part an independent Hamitic or Canaanite kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), but occasionally, as in the days of Solomon and Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), subject to Israel Others, however, justly considering the great improbability of the Israelite dominion having ever extended so far north as the valley of the Orontes, and observing how it is spoken of as an integral part of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>), look for Hamath much further south, in the neighbourhood of Beth-rehob (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>, note). As regards the phrase "the entering in of Hamath," the identical Hebrew words occur seven times, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; in this passage; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>, and are variously rendered in the A.V.: "as men come to Hamath;" "unto the entrance of Hamath;" "the entering into Hamath;" "the entering in of Hamath (three times); and the entering of Hamath." The exact meaning of the phrase seems to be "the approach to Hamath," some particular spot in the valley from whence the direct road to Hamath begins; very much like the railway term for certain stations which are the nearest to, though at some little distance from, the place from which they are named, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Shapwick Road, Mildenhall Road, etc. The latter words of the verse describe the territory of the Hivites, which reached from Mount Baal-hermon in the Lebanon range as far as the point where the road leads to Hamath. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 As the Israelites were a type of the church on earth, they were not to be idle and slothful. The Lord was pleased to try them by the remains of the devoted nations they spared. Temptations and trials detect the wickedness of the hearts of sinners; and strengthen he graces of believers in their daily conflict with Satan, sin, and this evil world. They must live in this world, but they are not of it, and are forbidden to conform to it. This marks the difference between the followers of Christ and mere professors. The friendship of the world is more fatal than its enmity; the latter can only kill the body, but the former murders many precious souls.</body></html>
