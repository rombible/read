in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-3.htm" title="And the sons of Bela were, Addar, and Gera, and Abihud,">1Chronicles 8:3</a> he is a son of Bela, son of Benjamin. The name Gera was hereditary in the tribe of Benjamin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-18.htm" title="And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;">2Samuel 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,">1Chronicles 8:1-7</a>), and the Jews so constantly omit steps in their genealogies that we can never be sure that "son" means more than "descendant." Ehud seems to be another form of Abihud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,">1Chronicles 8:1-8</a>). St. Jerome explains it to mean "one who praises "or "is praised." Josephus calls him a young man, and even "a youth" (<span class= "ital">neaniskos</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">A Benjamite.</span>--"Ben-ha-jemini," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-1.htm" title="O LORD my God, in you do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:">Psalm 7:1</a>. The word is generally written undivided, so that here the LXX., Vulgate, and Luther have "son of Jemini." No doubt the Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee rightly understood it to mean a Benjamite, but still there seems to be an intentional play on words, for "Ben-ha-jemini" may also mean "a <span class= "ital">son of the right hand, </span>who," as the writer adds, "was <span class= "ital">helpless with his right hand</span>" (<span class= "ital">Ben-ha-jemini eesh itter jad-jemini</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Lefthanded--Marg.,</span> "Shut of his right hand." Luther also renders it "<span class= "ital">links" </span>but the LXX. and the Vulgate take it to mean "ambidextrous," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>able to use his left hand as well as his right (LXX., <span class= "ital">amphoterodexion; </span>Vulg., <span class= "ital">qui utrague manu pro dextera utebatur</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Josephus says that he was "best skilled in using his left hand, in which was his whole strength" (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 4, ? 2). This rendering is merely an inference, from the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/20-15.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.">Judges 20:15-16</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.">1Chronicles 12:2</a>) there are <span class= "ital">"</span>700 chosen men left-handed." (See the Note on that verse.) The Hebrew <span class= "ital">itter, </span>however, is correctly rendered "shut" in the margin of our version (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-16.htm" title="Hear me, O LORD; for your loving kindness is good: turn to me according to the multitude of your tender mercies.">Psalm 69:16</a>, "lest the pit <span class= "ital">shut </span>her mouth upon me "), and cannot possibly mean "ambidextrous." No doubt Ehud, like other Benjamites, might have been trained to use the sling with the left hand, but it does not follow that he may not have had some accident which maimed the right hand; and if so it would avert all suspicion from him in his dreadful purpose. Ehud in that case was a Hebrew <span class= "ital">Sc?vola. </span>Stobaeus mentions some African tribes which, like the Benjamites, were "left-hand fighters" (<span class= "ital">aristeromachoi</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and for the same cause an Egyptian tribe was known as the <span class= "ital">Euonymitae. </span>The Greek <span class= "ital">Laius </span>has the same meaning.<p><span class= "bld">By him.</span>--Either because he was the chief of one of their houses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-6.htm" title="And these are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to Manahath:">1Chronicles 8:6</a>), or perhaps because he had intimated to them his design. The narrative in Judges 20 falls chronologically in the days of Phinehas and, therefore, Ehud's act occurred at a still earlier period after the conquest; for Ehud would hardly have been chosen for this honourable function after the terrible degradation and decimation of the tribe of Benjamin. Possibly Eglon's invasion occurred soon after Joshua's death.<p><span class= "bld">Sent a present.</span>--The Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">minchah, </span>here euphemistically used for "tribute," as it is elsewhere. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2Samuel 8:6</a> : "And the Syrians became servants to David, and <span class= "ital">brought gifts." </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm" title="And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.">1Kings 4:21</a> : "They [the Philistines] <span class= "ital">brought presents </span>and served Solomon." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm" title="The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.">Psalm 72:10</a> : "The kings of Sheba and Seba shall <span class= "ital">bring gifts."</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Left-handed</span>. It was a peculiarity of the warriors of the tribe of Benjamin to be left-handed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). A left-handed man wearing no sword or dagger on his left side, and using his right hand for other purposes, would naturally throw a man off his guard. Thus Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him, and then smote him with the sword in his left hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A deliverer</span>. Hebrew, a <span class="accented">saviour</span> (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">A present</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their tribute. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-30 When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
