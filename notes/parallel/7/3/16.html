Jerome, in the Vulgate, after rightly rendering the word <span class= "ital">ancipitem, </span>adds, "having a handle in the midst," which seems useless and meaningless, and has no equivalent in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">A cubit length.</span>--The LXX. and Vulgate render it <span class= "ital">a span long </span>(<span class= "ital">spitham?s, palm?; </span>Luther, <span class= "ital">eine elle lang</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The Hebrew word is not <span class= "ital">amm?h, </span>the usual word for a cubit, but <span class= "ital">gomed. </span>A dagger of <span class= "ital">a span long </span>hardly, however, suits the following narrative, and perhaps <span class= "ital">gomed </span>is an archaic word for <span class= "ital">amm?h. </span>It meant originally "a staff."<p><span class= "bld">Under his raiment.</span>--The LXX. and Vulgate have "under his war-cloak" (LXX. <span class= "ital">manduan, </span>Vulg. <span class= "ital">sagum</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The LXX., however, are only adopting a method very common with them--of choosing a Greek or, as in this case, a Persian (Hesych.) word which <span class= "ital">resembles </span>the Hebrew word (<span class= "ital">maddim</span>) in sound. The root of the Hebrew word shows that a long flowing robe (<span class= "ital">vestis talaris</span>) is intended. Dean Stanley suggests that he wore it as leader of the tribe. Prudentius describes Discord as "hiding a dagger under her robe."<p><span class= "bld">Upon his right thigh.</span>--This would avert all suspicion. Doubtless the war-cloak was flung in folds over the left shoulder, and Eglon, unaware that the bearer of the tribute was left-handed, would see that the side at which arms were usually worn was covered with a flowing robe, and would not suspect the dagger hidden at the <span class= "ital">right </span>side. Daggers were often, however, worn at the right side, when a sword was slung to the left. Amasa fell by a similar act of treachery. Joab, advancing to kiss him, clasped his beard with his <span class= "ital">right </span>hand, while with his unsuspected left he gave the deadly thrust (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/20-9.htm" title="And Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.">2Samuel 20:9-10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-30 When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
