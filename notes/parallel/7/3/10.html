because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a>), perhaps with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25</a>. They render the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>, "spirit of courage from Jehovah." This expression constantly recurs in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm" title="Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.">Judges 13:25</a>). For "came upon him" (literally "w<span class= "ital">as upon </span>him"), a stronger phrase is "clothed him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm" title="Then the spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Your are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.">1Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2Chronicles 24:20</a>). The Jews, however, placed Othniel highest among the judges, and applied to him the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-7.htm" title="You are all fair, my love; there is no spot in you.">Song of Solomon 4:7</a>, "Thou art all fair; there is no spot in thee," because he alone of the judges is represented as irreproachable. Further than this, they followed some dim traditional data in identifying him with Jabez (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-10.htm" title="And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that you would bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that your hand might be with me, and that you would keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.">1Chronicles 4:10</a>), and regarding him as a learned teacher of the law. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Judges 1:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He judged Israel.</span>--Some of the Rabbis explain "judged" (<span class= "ital">yishhab</span>) here to mean "avenged," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-1.htm" title="Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.">Psalm 43:1</a>, "Avenge me, O God" (<span class= "ital">Shapeteni</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span>possibly from disliking the notion of a Kenizzite, however distinguished, holding the office of a <span class= "ital">suffes, </span>or judge. There is a difficulty about Othniel's age; Caleb was eighty-five at the conquest, and, if Othniel was his brother, he could not have been less than fifty or sixty at that time. But even supposing him to have been Caleb's nephew, and aged forty at his marriage, then, since Joshua lived to be 110, and Cushan-Rishathaim's oppression did not begin till after the death of the elders who outlived Joshua, and lasted eight years, if Othniel was judge for forty years, this would make him quite 143 years old at his death. It is only another sign that the chronological data of the Book of Judges are not sufficiently definite to enable us to construct a system out of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Spirit</span>, etc. This marks Othniel as one of the extraordinary <span class="accented">Shophetim</span>, or judges, Divinely commissioned to save Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6, 19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 The first judge was Othniel: even in Joshua's time Othniel began to be famous. Soon after Israel's settlement in Canaan their purity began to be corrupted, and their peace disturbed. But affliction makes those cry to God who before would scarcely speak to him. God returned in mercy to them for their deliverance. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel. The Spirit of wisdom and courage to qualify him for the service, and the Spirit of power to excite him to it. He first judged Israel, reproved and reformed them, and then went to war. Let sin at home be conquered, that worst of enemies, then enemies abroad will be more easily dealt with. Thus let Christ be our Judge and Lawgiver, then he will save us.</body></html>
