The Hebrew for "blade" is "flame," as the LXX. here render it. It is as though the vivid narrator would make us see the flash of the dagger ere it is buried, hilt and all, in the huge body. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-3.htm" title="The horseman lifts up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcasses; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble on their corpses:">Nahum 3:3</a> we have, "The horseman lifteth up the flame of the sword and the lightning of the spear." The only other passage where the word occurs is to describe the polished head of the spear of Goliath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm" title="And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.">1Samuel 17:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So that he could not draw the dagger out.</span>--Thus he had disarmed himself by the force of his own blow; but the original only says, "for he did not draw the dagger out."<p><span class= "bld">And the dirt came out.</span>--The meaning of this clause is excessively doubtful, because the Hebrew word rendered "dirt" (<span class= "ital">parsedonah</span>) occurs here and here only. (1) Our E.V. follows the Chaldee and the Vulgate with the alternative rendering (2) "it came out at the fundament" (<span class= "ital">marg.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which is the view of Gesenius. The Jews were themselves uncertain of the meaning and even in Rabbi Tanchum's commentary we find that some understood it to mean (3) "he (Ehud) ran out into the gallery." (4) A fourth guess--that of the Syriac version--is, "he went out hastily." The LXX. omit it altogether, either because they thought that they were consulting propriety--a tendency which they constantly show--or because they could not rightly explain it. The resemblance of the word <span class= "ital">parsedonah </span>to the word <span class= "ital">misder?nah </span>("porch"), in the next clause, is certainly in favour of its meaning some part of the house. Ewald renders it, "he rushed out into the gallery," which runs round the roof. He refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm" title="Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.">Ezekiel 42:5</a>. To understand it more exactly, we should require to know the structure of the house. Following the analogy of other Eastern houses, as described by Shaw, it seems that Eglon's <span class= "ital">alijah </span>was a separate building (<span class= "ital">domation, </span>Jos.), or part of a building, with one door opening on a balcony, and another on a private staircase and closet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-24.htm" title="When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covers his feet in his summer chamber.">Judges 3:24</a>). It was an <span class= "ital">inner </span>room, and its outer door communicated with the house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The haft</span>, etc. Ehud, feeling the necessity of killing Eglon at one blow, plunged the dagger into his body with such force that the handle went in with the blade, and he was unable to draw it out. Leaving it, therefore, buried in his fat, he <span class="accented">went out</span> at once into the <span class="accented">parshedon</span>, or antechamber, for so it is best to render the last words of the verse, and thence into the <span class="accented">misederon</span>, the outer porch, having first locked the door of the summer chamber. The words <span class="accented">parshedon</span> and <span class="accented">misederon</span> occur only here, and the former is very variously rendered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-30 When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
