Lehi is here the name of the place, and if the fountain is said to have sprung up in <span class= "ital">Hammaktesh, "the </span>tooth-socket" (Vulg., <span class= "ital">molarem</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>that is only due to the play on words which characterises the narrative. When the cliff had got the name of "Jawbone," the spring would naturally be called a <span class= "ital">"</span>tooth-socket." The word <span class= "ital">maktesh </span>properly means "a mortar" (Greek, <span class= "ital">holmiskos; </span>Lat., <span class= "ital">mortariolum</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-22.htm" title="Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.">Proverbs 27:22</a>), and this name was transferred to the sockets of teeth. We find another place with the same name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm" title="Howl, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.">Zephaniah 1:11</a>. Milton understood the passage rightly:--<p>"God, who caused a fountain at thy prayer<p><span class= "ital">From the dry ground to spring </span>thy thirst to allay."<p>For similar instances in the Bible, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-19.htm" title="And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.">Genesis 21:19</a> (Hagar); <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm" title="Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.">Exodus 17:6</a> (the smitten rock); <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/41-17.htm" title="When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.">Isaiah 41:17-18</a> ("When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys . . . I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water"). Josephus says that God caused to spring up for Samson "a plentiful fountain of sweet water at a certain rock."<p><span class= "bld">He called the name thereof.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the name thereof was called.</span><p><span class= "bld">En-hakkore.</span>--<span class= "ital">The Spring of the Crier. </span>These names have vanished, but perhaps traces of them may still be discovered "in the abundant springs and numerous eminences of the district round Urtas," the place from which Solomon's pleasure-gardens and the Temple and Bethlehem were supplied with water.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (or, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God clave</span>, etc. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8, 11</a>. The A.V. (as the Septuagint and Vulgate seem to have done, and Luther and others) has quite misconceived the statement in the text, as if God had cloven a hollow place in the jawbone, and brought out the water thence; whereas the statement is quite clear that <span class="accented">God clave the hollow place which is in Lehi</span> (<span class="accented">hal-Lehi</span>, ver. 9, note), and that a spring of water came out, to which Samson gave the name <span class="accented">En-hakkorch</span>, the spring of him that called upon God, which name continued till the time of the writer. The spring apparently continued till the time of St. Jerome, and of other later writers, in the seventh, twelfth, and fourteenth centuries; but Robinson was unable to identify it with any certainty ('B.R.,' 2:64). The word translated the (not a) <span class="accented">hollow place</span> (ham-<span class="accented">maktesh</span>) means a <span class="accented">mortar</span>; also the <span class="accented">cavity in the jaw</span> from which the molar teeth grow. The hollow ground from which the spring rose, with which Samson quenched his thirst, from its shape and from the connection with <span class="accented">hal-Lechi</span> (the jawbone) was called <span class="accented">hammaktech.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a> it is also a proper name, apparently of some spot near Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The name thereof</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the fountain, with which <span class="accented">thereof</span>, which is in the feminine gender, agrees. <span class="cmt_word">Which is in Lehi unto this day</span>. This punctuation does not agree with the Hebrew accents, which put a strong stop after <span class="accented">Lehi</span>. The Hebrew accents rather convey the sense that the name <span class="accented">En</span>-<span class="accented">kakkoreh</span> continued to be the name of the well unto the day of the writer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:18-20 So little notice did the men of Judah take of their deliverer, that he was ready to perish for want of a draught of water. Thus are the greatest slights often put upon those who do the greatest services. Samson prayed to God in this distress. Those that forget to attend God their praises, may be compelled to attend him with their prayers. Past experiences of God's power and goodness, are excellent pleas in prayer for further mercy. He pleads his being exposed to God's enemies; our best pleas are taken from God's glory. The Lord sent him seasonable relief. The place of this action was, from the jaw-bone, called Lehi. And in the place thus called, God caused a fountain suddenly and seasonably to open, close by Samson. We should be more thankful for the mercy of water, did we consider how ill we can spare it. Israel submitted to him whom they had betrayed. God was with him; henceforward they were directed by him as their judge.</body></html>
