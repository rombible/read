In this instance, at any rate, Samson might feel himself absolved from the rule of ceremonial cleanness, which forbad him as a Nazarite to touch carcases. A jawbone is a mighty magic weapon in one of the Polynesian legends (Grey, <span class= "ital">Polyn. Mythology, </span>p. 35), but that throws no light on this narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Slew a thousand men.</span>--The verb is rather <span class= "ital">smote </span>than "slew," and the expression (whether due to poetry or not) is to be taken generally, like "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands." If Goliath was able single-handed to strike terror into the whole army of Israel, Samson with his long locks and colossal strength would be still more likely to strike a terror into the Philistines, and all the more because a supernatural awe was doubtless attached by this time to his name and person. The very fact that, though armed only with this wretched weapon of offence, he yet dared to rush upon the Philistines would make them fly in wilder panic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm" title="One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fights for you, as he has promised you.">Joshua 23:10</a>). "One man of you shall chase a thousand; for the Lord your God He it is that fighteth for you, as He hath promised you." (Comp. Leviticus 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm" title="How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>.) So we read that one of David's heroes slew three hundred men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1Chronicles 11:11</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm" title="These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.">2Samuel 23:8</a>). The Philistines, dull and superstitious, seem to have been peculiarly liable to these panics (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1Samuel 14:4-18</a>). Bishop Patrick quotes a striking parallel from a song on the Emperor Aurelian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - A most vivid and stirring description! The Spirit of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>), with that suddenness which marks his extraordinary movements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>, etc.), came upon Samson, and mightily strengthened him in his outer man. The strong new cords snapped asunder in an instant, and before the Philistines could recover from their terror at seeing their great enemy free, he had snatched up the heavy jawbone of an ass recently dead, and with it smote the flying Philistines till a thousand of them had fallen under his blows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Sin dispirits men, it hides from their eyes the things that belong to their peace. The Israelites blamed Samson for what he had done against the Philistines, as if he had done them a great injury. Thus our Lord Jesus did many good works, and for those the Jews were ready to stone him. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, his cords were loosed: where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and those are free indeed who are thus set free. Thus Christ triumphed over the powers of darkness that shouted against him, as if they had him in their power. Samson made great destruction among the Philistines. To take the bone of an ass for this, was to do wonders by the foolish things of the world, that the excellency of the power might be of God, not of man. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arm; but it was in the Spirit of God, which moved the weapon by the arm. We can do all things through Him that strengtheneth us. Seest thou a poor Christian, who is enabled to overcome a temptation by weak, feeble counsel, there is the Philistine vanquished by a sorry jaw-bone.</body></html>
