The word here rendered <span class="accented">fox</span> (<span class="accented">shu'al</span>, in Persian <span class="accented">shagal</span>, which is etymologically the same word as <span class="accented">jackal</span>) includes the jackal, which is as common in Palestine as the fox. Here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10</a>, the gregarious jackals, the canis <span class="accented">aureus</span>, are undoubtedly meant. <span class="cmt_word">Caught</span>. The Hebrew word means especially <span class="accented">caught in nets</span> or snares. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a> (have <span class="accented">taken</span> nothing at all); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a> (let his net catch himself); <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-22.htm">Jeremiah 18:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> (<span class="accented">taken</span>), etc. And it is in this sense that the A.V. uses the word <span class="accented">caught</span>. A clever sportsman, as no doubt Samson was, would have no difficulty whatever in netting or snaring 300 jackals, which always move in packs, and would be attracted by the vineyards of Thimnathah, for which their partiality is well known (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>, note). The writer of the additional article <span class="accented">Fox</span> in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' states that he had tried the experiment of throwing grapes to the foxes, jackals, and wolves in the Zoological Gardens. The wolves would not touch them, the others ate them with avidity. <span class="cmt_word">Took firebrands</span>, etc. Many cavils have been directed against the truth of this account, but without the slightest reason. The terrified animals, with the burning torches and the blazing straw behind them, would necessarily run forwards. Samson would, of course, start the couples at numerous different points, and no doubt have a number of Hebrews to assist him. To the present day the corn-fields in that part of the <span class="accented">Shephelah</span> extend continuously for twenty or thirty miles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 When there are differences between relations, let those be reckoned the wisest and best, who are most forward to forgive or forget, and most willing to stoop and yield for the sake of peace. In the means which Samson employed, we must look at the power of God supplying them, and making them successful, to mortify the pride and punish the wickedness of the Philistines. The Philistines threatened Samson's wife that they would burn her and her father's house. She, to save herself and oblige her countrymen, betrayed her husband; and the very thing that she feared, and by sin sought to avoid, came upon her! She, and her father's house, were burnt with fire, and by her countrymen, whom she thought to oblige by the wrong she did to her husband. The mischief we seek to escape by any unlawful practices, we often pull down upon our own heads.</body></html>
