It may be purely general, like the German expression "<span class= "ital">Arm und Bein," </span>or "<span class= "ital">er hieb den Feind in die Pfanne," </span>or "in <span class= "ital">Kochstcke</span>" ("A blow strikes a fugitive on the hip, and that would be enough; another blow on the thigh ends him"). "Hence," says Ewald, "it means thigh over and above"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>besides the hip. It cannot possibly mean "cavalry and infantry," as the Chaldee renders it, or be a reference to wrestling (Greek, <span class= "ital">huposkelizein</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>nor is it likely to have a sacrificial origin ("good and bad pieces"). It is hard to see what St. Jerome means by his gloss "<span class= "ital">ita ut slupentes suram femori imponerent." </span>Literally it is, <span class= "ital">thigh upon hip, </span>or <span class= "ital">leg upon thigh </span>(LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?????? ??? ?????</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>May it not have had its origin in some such fierce custom as that known to the Greeks as <span class= "ital">akroteriasmos, </span>or <span class= "ital">maschalismos, </span>in which the extremities of a corpse were cut off and placed under the arm-pits? ('sch. <span class= "ital">Cho. </span>439; Soph. <span class= "ital">El. </span>445.) Thus in Hesychius and Suidas <span class= "ital">maschalismata </span>means "mutilated limbs," and also "the flesh of the shoulders laid on the haunches at sacrifices."<p><span class= "bld">With a great slaughter.</span>--It is not said, nor is it necessarily implied (any more than in the case of Shamgar), that Samson was absolutely alone in these raids. There is nothing either in the narrative or in the ordinary style of Hebrew prose which makes any such inference necessary, nor, indeed, is there any such inference drawn in many similar passages (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Judgesi. 20, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">In the top of the rock Etam.</span>--It should undoubtedly be <span class= "ital">in a ravine </span>(or cave) <span class= "ital">of the cliff Etam. </span>For instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-11.htm" title="Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Know you not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.">Judges 15:11</a> the men of Judah could not go <span class= "ital">down </span>to the top of a rock, and the same word is rendered "cleft" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?">Isaiah 57:5</a>, and should be so rendered for "top" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-21.htm" title="The rings, and nose jewels,">Isaiah 3:21</a> (LXX., "in a hole of the rock," and "in the cave of Etam;" Vulg., <span class= "ital">in spelunca petrae</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This explains the expression "went down" in this verse, and "brought him up" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-13.htm" title="And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.">Judges 15:13</a>. Such cliff-caves are the natural refuge of oppressed peoples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-2.htm" title="And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm" title="When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.">1Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm" title="Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?">1Kings 18:13</a>). These caves, like the cave of Aduliam, are often supplied with water by natural springs, and one man may defend them against a multitude. The LXX. (Cod. A) add the words "by the torrent." The site of Etam is uncertain; but it is in the tribe of Judah, which Samson only enters once, or, possibly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-3.htm" title="And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.">Judges 16:3</a>), twice, and then only as a fugitive.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He smote them hip and thigh</span>, etc. A proverbial expression, the origin of which is uncertain; it means, he smote them with a great and complete slaughter. It is reasonable to suppose that he had gathered a few Hebrews round him to help him. <span class="cmt_word">He went down</span>, etc. This shows that <span class="accented">Etam</span> must have been situated lower than Tinmath, and seems to preclude its identification with <span class="accented">Urtas</span>, in the hill country of Judah, between Bethlehem and Tekoah, which apparently represents the <span class="accented">Etam</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>. But there is another Etam in the tribe of Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>), which may possibly be the Etam of our text. <span class="cmt_word">In the top of the rock</span>. Rather, the <span class="accented">cleft or fissure</span> of the rock - some narrow and inaccessible ravine. The site has not been identified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 15:9-20 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 When there are differences between relations, let those be reckoned the wisest and best, who are most forward to forgive or forget, and most willing to stoop and yield for the sake of peace. In the means which Samson employed, we must look at the power of God supplying them, and making them successful, to mortify the pride and punish the wickedness of the Philistines. The Philistines threatened Samson's wife that they would burn her and her father's house. She, to save herself and oblige her countrymen, betrayed her husband; and the very thing that she feared, and by sin sought to avoid, came upon her! She, and her father's house, were burnt with fire, and by her countrymen, whom she thought to oblige by the wrong she did to her husband. The mischief we seek to escape by any unlawful practices, we often pull down upon our own heads.</body></html>
