The character of the narrative suggests the question whether the name may not have existed previously, and the play on words may not have been <span class= "ital">adapted </span>by Samson to the incident. For the name of the place is <span class= "ital">Lechi </span>(<span class= "greekheb">?????? </span>), and "a jawbone" is <span class= "ital">Lehi </span>(<span class= "greekheb">???</span>)<span class= "ital">. Shen, </span>"tooth," is the name of an isolated sharp rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1Samuel 14:4</a>), and therefore "jaw" would not be an unnatural name for a range of such rocks. Josephus, however, says that before Samson's exploit the place "had no name." It may be again alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.">2Samuel 23:11</a>, where the words rendered "into a troop" may mean "to Lehi," as it is understood by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. </span>vii. 12, ? 4) and some MSS. of the LXX.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went up</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from their own country in the Shephelah to the hill country of Judah.

Lehi has been identified by some with <span class="accented">Tell-el-Lekhiyeh</span>, four miles above Beer-sheba; and by others with <span class="accented">Beit-Likiyeh</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the Wady Suleiman, two miles below the upper Beth-heron, and so within easy distance of Timnath and other places mentioned in the history of Samson. But no certainty can at present be arrived at. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Sin dispirits men, it hides from their eyes the things that belong to their peace. The Israelites blamed Samson for what he had done against the Philistines, as if he had done them a great injury. Thus our Lord Jesus did many good works, and for those the Jews were ready to stone him. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, his cords were loosed: where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and those are free indeed who are thus set free. Thus Christ triumphed over the powers of darkness that shouted against him, as if they had him in their power. Samson made great destruction among the Philistines. To take the bone of an ass for this, was to do wonders by the foolish things of the world, that the excellency of the power might be of God, not of man. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arm; but it was in the Spirit of God, which moved the weapon by the arm. We can do all things through Him that strengtheneth us. Seest thou a poor Christian, who is enabled to overcome a temptation by weak, feeble counsel, there is the Philistine vanquished by a sorry jaw-bone.</body></html>
