Josephus gives the riddle in the form,"the all-devouring having generated sweet food from itself, though itself far from sweet" (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 8, ? 6). The whole of Samson's life has been described by Ewald as "a charming poetic picture, in which the interspersed verses gleam forth like the brightest pearls in a circlet." It must be confessed that the riddle was hardly a fair one, for the event to which it alluded was most unusual, and no one could have guessed such a riddle without some clue; for--<p>" 'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb<p>In the dead carrion."<p>Shakespeare: <span class= "ital">Henry V., </span>ii. 4.<p>Cassel quotes a curious parallel from the legends of North Germany. The judges offer a woman her husband's life if she can make a riddle which they cannot guess. On her way to the court she had found the carcase of a horse in which a bird had built its nest and hatched six young ones, which she took away. Her riddle was (I venture rudely to translate the rude old lines):--<p>"As hitherwards on my way I sped,<p>I took the living out of the dead,<p>Six were thus of the seventh made quit:--<p>To rede my riddle, my lords, 'tis fit."<p>The judges failed, and the husband was spared (Mullen-hof, <span class= "ital">Sagen, </span>p. 506).<p><span class= "bld">In three days.</span>--It is hard to see why this is mentioned if it was only on the <span class= "ital">seventh </span>day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?">Judges 14:15</a>) that they tried the unfair means of inducing Samson's wife to reveal the secret. Bishop Hervey conjectures, with much probability, that we should read <span class= "ital">shesheth </span>"six," for <span class= "ital">shelsheth, </span>"four." The LXX. and Syriac read "on the fourth day," and <span class= "greekheb"></span> (7) may easily have been confused with <span class= "greekheb"></span> (4).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:10-20 Samson's riddle literally meant no more than that he had got honey, for food and for pleasure, from the lion, which in its strength and fury was ready to devour him. But the victory of Christ over Satan, by means of his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation that followed to him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritual advantages to his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death, that devouring monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of his horror, forwards the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and other senses, out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong, sweetness. Samson's companions obliged his wife to get the explanation from him. A worldly wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as an enemy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to betray him. No union can be comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted, without danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of our corrupt nature. His chief advantage against us arises from his correspondence with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This proved an occasion of weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well for us, if the unkindness we meet with from the world, and our disappointments in it, obliged us by faith and prayer to return to our heavenly Father's house, and to rest there. See how little confidence is to be put in man. Whatever pretence of friendship may be made, a real Philistine will soon be weary of a true Israelite.</body></html>
