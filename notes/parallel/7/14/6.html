And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.">Judges 14:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-14.htm" title="And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and the cords that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.">Judges 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1Samuel 10:10</a>.

Of course this was a most heroic exploit, but it is not unparalleled. Pausanias, in his <span class= "ital">Eliaca </span>(ap. Suid. <span class= "ital">Lex. </span>s.v Polydamas), related a feat of the athlete Polydamas, who in his youth slew, while unarmed, a great and strong lion in Olympus, B.C. 400. Cases are recorded in which Arabs have done the same. Similar acts of prowess are attributed to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-54.htm" title="And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.">1Samuel 17:54</a>) and to Benaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-28.htm" title="Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,">2Samuel 23:28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He told not his father or his mother.</span>--This reticence shows how free he was from all boastfulness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord</span>, etc. - as a spirit of dauntless courage and irresistible strength of body. <span class="cmt_word">Came mightily</span>.

The Hebrew has <span class="accented">the kid</span>, with the definite article, which is not prefixed unless some particular kid is meant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-23.htm">Genesis 38:23</a>. Perhaps the kid means the one about to be served, which the cook rends open either before or after it is cooked. Unless some such operation is alluded to, it is not easy to understand what the rending of the kid means. <span class="cmt_word">He told not his father</span>, etc. This is mentioned to. explain ver. 16; but it shows that Samson had wandered some distance from his parents among the vineyards (see note to ver. 5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:5-9 By enabling him to kill a lion, God let Samson know what he could do in the strength of the Spirit of the Lord, that he might never be afraid to look the greatest difficulties in the face. He was alone in the vineyards, whither he had rambled. Young people consider not how they exposed themselves to the roaring lion that seeks to devour, when they wander from their prudent, pious parents. Nor do men consider what lions lurk in the vineyards, the vineyards of red wines. Our Lord Jesus having conquered Satan, that roaring lion, believers, like Samson, find honey in the carcass abundant strength and satisfaction, enough for themselves, and for all their friends.</body></html>
