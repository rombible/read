There is some apparent difficulty in understanding how to reconcile this statement with what was said in ver. 14, that they could not in <span class="accented">three days</span> expound the riddle; and also with what is said in vers. 16 and 17, that Samson's wife <span class="accented">wept before him the seven days of the feast.</span> And several different readings have arisen from this difficulty: viz., in this verse, the reading of the <span class="accented">fourth</span> day for the <span class="accented">seventh</span>, and the omission of the words, <span class="accented">And it came to pass on the seventh day</span>; and, in the latter part of ver. 14, seven days for three days. But all difficulty will disappear if we bear in mind the peculiarity of Hebrew narrative noticed in note to section vers. 1-6 of ch. 2, when we come to consider ver. 16. <span class="cmt_word">Entice thy husband</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That he may declare unto us</span>.

But it is simpler either to read with the Septuagint, that he <span class="accented">may declare unto you</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>, or to read, and <span class="accented">declare unto us</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the imperative mood. Burn with fire. See ch. 12:1, and Judges 15:6. Have ye called us, etc., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Did you invite us to this feast in order to impoverish us, to plunder us of our property? We shall conclude that you did so if you do not disclose to us the riddle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:10-20 Samson's riddle literally meant no more than that he had got honey, for food and for pleasure, from the lion, which in its strength and fury was ready to devour him. But the victory of Christ over Satan, by means of his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation that followed to him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritual advantages to his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death, that devouring monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of his horror, forwards the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and other senses, out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong, sweetness. Samson's companions obliged his wife to get the explanation from him. A worldly wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as an enemy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to betray him. No union can be comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted, without danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of our corrupt nature. His chief advantage against us arises from his correspondence with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This proved an occasion of weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well for us, if the unkindness we meet with from the world, and our disappointments in it, obliged us by faith and prayer to return to our heavenly Father's house, and to rest there. See how little confidence is to be put in man. Whatever pretence of friendship may be made, a real Philistine will soon be weary of a true Israelite.</body></html>
