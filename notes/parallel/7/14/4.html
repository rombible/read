It is the strong sense of the Divine rule which we find even in heathen writers, so that in the very opening lines of Homer we find the poet saying, "that amid all the crimes and passions of men the counsel of Zeus was being accomplished."<p>"Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring<p>Of woes unnumbered, heavenly goddess sing:<p>That wrath which hurled to Pluto's gloomy reign<p>The souls of mighty chiefs unnumbered slain,<p>Whose limbs, unburied on the naked shore,<p>Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore,<p>Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,--<p>Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!."<p><span class= "bld">That he sought an occasion.</span>--Some commentators explain "he" to mean Jehovah, which seems most unlikely.

The writer explains the purpose of the providence. It is doubtful whether "he" refers to Samson or to the Lord. Most commentators refer it to Samson; but it is contrary to the whole tenor of Samson's impetuous course, and to all probability, that he should have asked for the Timnathite damsel merely for the sake of quarreling with the Philistines; whereas the statement that Samson s obstinate determination to take a Philistine wife was the means which God's secret purpose had fixed upon for bringing about the eventual overthrow of the Philistine dominion is in exact accordance with other declarations of Holy Scripture (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-25.htm">1 Samuel 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-15.htm">1 Kings 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-15.htm">2 Chronicles 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-7.htm">2 Chronicles 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-20.htm">2 Chronicles 25:20</a>). An occasion. The noun only occurs here; but the verb, in its several conjugations, means, to <span class="accented">happen at the right time</span>; <span class="accented">to bring a person or thing at the right time</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, <span class="accented">deliver</span>, A.V.); to <span class="accented">be brought at the right time</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>, happen, A.V.); to seek <span class="accented">the right time for injuring any one</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-7.htm">2 Kings 5:7</a>, <span class="accented">seeketh a quarrel</span>, A.V. ). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-4 As far as Samson's marriage was a common case, it was weak and foolish of him to set his affections upon a daughter of the Philistines. Shall one, not only an Israelite, but a Nazarite, devoted to the Lord, covet to become one with a worshipper of Dagon? It does not appear that he had any reason to think her wise or virtuous, or any way likely to be a help meet for him; but he saw something in her agreeable to his fancy. He that, in the choice of a wife, is only guided by his eye, and governed by his fancy, must afterwards thank himself if he find a Philistine in his arms. Yet it was well done not to proceed till Samson had made his parents acquainted with the matter. Children ought not to marry, nor to move towards it, without the advice and consent of their parents. Samson's parents did well to dissuade him from yoking himself unequally with unbelievers. It seems that it pleased God to leave Samson to follow his own inclinations, intending to bring out good from his conduct; and his parents consented, because he was bent upon it. However, his example is not recorded for us to do likewise.</body></html>
