The use of riddles at feasts is of great antiquity both among the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm" title="And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.">1Kings 10:1</a>, &c.) and Greeks (Athen. x. 457; Pollux, vi. 107, &c.). Jewish legends have much to tell us of the riddles which passed between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and between Solomon and Hiram (Dius <span class= "ital">ap. </span>Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. </span>viii. 5, ? 3); and as large sums often depended on the discovery of the answer, they were very much of the nature of wagers. A sharp boy named Abdemon helped Hiram, just as the Greek sage Bias is said to have helped Amasis to solve the riddles of the Ethiopian king, which would otherwise have caused heavy losses. The Sphinx of Theban legend devoured those who could not solve her riddle. Mirth and riddles are also connected with the rites of Hercules (Mller, <span class= "ital">Dorians, </span>ii. 12).<p><span class= "bld">Sheets.</span>--Rather, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">shirts; </span>but it means shirts of fine linen (<span class= "ital">sedinim; </span>LXX. Vulg., <span class= "ital">sin-dones</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>such as are only won by the wealthy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-23.htm" title="The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.">Isaiah 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-51.htm" title="And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:">Mark 14:51</a>). Samson's offer was fair enough, for if defeated, each paranymph would only have to provide one <span class= "ital">sindon </span>and one robe, whereas Samson, if they guessed his riddle, would have to provide thirty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Riddle</span>. The Hebrew word is the same as that which is rendered hard <span class="accented">questions</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, and <span class="accented">dark questions</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>, and occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>, where the phrase is the same as here and in ver. 16, as if we should say in English, <span class="accented">I will riddle you a riddle</span>. In English, however, to <span class="accented">riddle</span>, as a verb active, means to <span class="accented">solve a riddle</span>, not, as in Hebrew, to propound one. The derivation of the Hebrew word and of the English is the same as regards the sense - something <span class="accented">intricate</span> and <span class="accented">twisted</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thirty sheets</span>, or rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">shirts</span>, a linen garment worn next the skin. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-23.htm">Isaiah 3:23</a> spoken of the women's garment, "<span class="accented">the fine linen</span>," A.V., as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>. The word (<span class="accented">sadin</span>, Sanscrit <span class="accented">sindu</span>) means Indian linen. Change of garments - the outward garment of the Orientalist, which was part of the wealth of the rich and great, and was, and is to the present day, one of the most frequent presents on all state occasions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:10-20 Samson's riddle literally meant no more than that he had got honey, for food and for pleasure, from the lion, which in its strength and fury was ready to devour him. But the victory of Christ over Satan, by means of his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation that followed to him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritual advantages to his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death, that devouring monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of his horror, forwards the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and other senses, out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong, sweetness. Samson's companions obliged his wife to get the explanation from him. A worldly wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as an enemy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to betray him. No union can be comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted, without danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of our corrupt nature. His chief advantage against us arises from his correspondence with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This proved an occasion of weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well for us, if the unkindness we meet with from the world, and our disappointments in it, obliged us by faith and prayer to return to our heavenly Father's house, and to rest there. See how little confidence is to be put in man. Whatever pretence of friendship may be made, a real Philistine will soon be weary of a true Israelite.</body></html>
