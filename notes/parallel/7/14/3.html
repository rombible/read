Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-14.htm">Genesis 34:14</a>. A term of reproach here added to deter Samson from the marriage. It is particularly applied to the Philistines (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-18.htm">Judges 15:18</a>; - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-29.htm">1 Samuel 18:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-4 As far as Samson's marriage was a common case, it was weak and foolish of him to set his affections upon a daughter of the Philistines. Shall one, not only an Israelite, but a Nazarite, devoted to the Lord, covet to become one with a worshipper of Dagon? It does not appear that he had any reason to think her wise or virtuous, or any way likely to be a help meet for him; but he saw something in her agreeable to his fancy. He that, in the choice of a wife, is only guided by his eye, and governed by his fancy, must afterwards thank himself if he find a Philistine in his arms. Yet it was well done not to proceed till Samson had made his parents acquainted with the matter. Children ought not to marry, nor to move towards it, without the advice and consent of their parents. Samson's parents did well to dissuade him from yoking himself unequally with unbelievers. It seems that it pleased God to leave Samson to follow his own inclinations, intending to bring out good from his conduct; and his parents consented, because he was bent upon it. However, his example is not recorded for us to do likewise.</body></html>
