and the construction in that case is changed in the middle of the verse, to remind them that they can now sing God's praises by the safe well-sides. The meaning is highly uncertain. The "they that are delivered" is a conjectural addition of our version. The Hebrew only has "from the noise." The Vulgate renders it, "where the chariots clashed together, and the army of the enemy was strangled." The LXX. (some MSS.) connect the clause with the last verse: "Sing;" or "tell it from (<span class= "ital">i.e. </span>by) the voice of those who strike up their tunes in the midst of the water-drawers." The Chaldee is here utterly vague. Ewald renders it, "from the shoutings of the spoil-dividers between the water-troughs." Amid these uncertainties we have nothing better to offer than the conjecture of our translators.<p><span class= "bld">Righteous acts.</span>--Where these words first occur, the Hebrew is <span class= "ital">Tsidkoth; </span>but in the second recurrence of the English words, "even the righteous acts towards the inhabitants of the villages"--in which they are guided by the Chaldee Targum--we have only the Hebrew words, <span class= "ital">Tsidkoth pirzono. </span>Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm" title="The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.">Judges 5:7</a>, the versions were perplexed by the word p<span class= "ital">erazon; </span>but it is now generally agreed that the meaning is either "the righteous acts of his governance in Israel" (Ewald), or "towards the leaders in Israel" (Rosenmller, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">Then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates.</span>--After singing the just deeds of God, they resumed their usual pursuits, unabashed and un-terrified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - A very difficult verse, and very variously rendered.

Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny of Jabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows what brought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose new gods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped. Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvation of their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of this great salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as are restored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to their rank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts of his, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution, God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life are drawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attend them. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer from drawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to his trembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are most exposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we have from the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and give God the praise.</body></html>
