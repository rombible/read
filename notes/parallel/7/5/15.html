If this be the right reading, Deborah calls them "my princes" with a touch of pride, and hence some have assumed that she belonged to the tribe of Issachar, not to that of Ephraim. But a very slight change gives the meaning of "the princes in Issachar." Deborah did not take actual part in the battle, like Boadicea or Joan of Arc, but seems to have been close at hand, in the rear, to encourage the combatants, as the ancient British and German women used to do, and as Arab women do to this day.<p><span class= "bld">Even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">even Issachar, as well as Barak, rushed down at his feet </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>after Barak) <span class= "ital">into the plain </span>(<span class= "ital">emek</span>)<span class= "ital">." </span>It is a pity that the verse does not end here, for the next clause begins the description of "the malingerers," whose cowardice or selfishness is triumphantly contrasted with the heroic daring of Zebulon and Naphtali in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm" title="Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.">Judges 5:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</span>--The word for "divisions" (<span class= "ital">pelagoth</span>) might mean "families" or "clans," as the LXX., or "factions," as the Vulgate seems to have understood it; but it almost certainly means <span class= "ital">streams, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm" title="He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.">Job 20:17</a> (margin, "streaming brooks"), where alone it recurs. The allusion is to the Jabbok and its numerous affluents. "Thoughts of heart" only occurs elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm" title="And in that day you shall say, O LORD, I will praise you: though you were angry with me, your anger is turned away, and you comforted me.">Isaiah 12:1</a>. where it is rendered "decrees," with the epithet "empty," or "vain." Possibly, therefore, an ironic contrast is intended between the magnanimous "decisions" (<span class= "ital">chikekey </span>l?bh) of Reuben and his evanescent "projects"( <span class= "ital">chikerey </span>l?bh). The play of words is almost certainly contemptuous, and there may be some lurking scorn in the word <span class= "ital">pelagoth </span>to imply either "rivers" or "factions." Reuben debated and stayed at home on frivolous pretences, as Sparta did in the days of Marathon. But even then the sting of the reproach lies in the taunting question of the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was sent on foot into the valley</span>.

He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.</body></html>
