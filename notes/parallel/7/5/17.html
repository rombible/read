The name is here probably meant to include Gad, as well as the half-tribe of Manasseh. The word "abode" means "stayed quietly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm" title="Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.">Psalm 16:9</a>), and is rendered <span class= "ital">qniesce-bat </span>in the Vulgate.<p><span class= "bld">Why did Dan remain in ships?</span>--The sudden question is very picturesque. The other rendering, "Why did Dan fear the ships (of the enemy)? "is untenable. The possession of Joppa. one of the few seaports of Palestine, naturally influenced the pursuits of the tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-46.htm" title="And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.">Joshua 19:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-7.htm" title="They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.">Ezra 3:7</a>); but whether they are here reproached for absorption in commerce, or for cowardice in taking refuge in their ships, is uncertain. The word rendered "remain" often involves a notion of "alarm" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm" title="Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>)<span class= "ital">. </span>If the Danite migration (Judges 18) had by this time occurred, it is almost impossible that they should not have rendered some assistance to the revolt of the northern tribes. The fact that it is not here alluded to shows the extremely early date at which this narrative must be placed.<p><span class= "bld">Asher continued on the sea shore.</span>--Aslier was the other great maritime tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/19-28.htm" title="And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Zidon;">Joshua 19:28-29</a>). The word "continued" is, literally, "sat."<p><span class= "bld">Abode in his breaches.</span>--The word rendered "breaches" is, literally, "clefts," or "fissures." The Chaldee curiously paraphrases it by "rebuilt and � dwelt in the cities which the Gentiles destroyed." Le Clerc renders it, "Sits in his precipitous rocks," referring it to that part of the coast known as "the Ladder of Tyre;" and this is perhaps meant by the <span class= "ital">diakopas </span>of the LXX. (Cod. Alex.). The Vulgate renders, <span class= "ital">in portibus. </span>Probably the "creeks" of the margin of our Bibles is the correct rendering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In ships</span>.

The creeks and bays where they kept their fishing. boats. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-23 Deborah called on her own soul to be in earnest. He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.</body></html>
