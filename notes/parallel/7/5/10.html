It is placed in the original in far more forcible position at the end of the verse.<p><span class= "bld">Ye that ride on white asses.</span>--That is, nobles and wealthy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>). The word can hardly mean "white," because there are no such things as white asses. It means rather "bright-coloured" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), "glossy-skinned," or "dappled" (<span class= "ital">super nitentes asinos, </span>Vulg.). These were the more valuable sort of asses, and were used by the rich and great. It is only because this was not understood among the Greeks and Romans, who despised the ass, that the LXX. and Josephus so often disguise the word in writing for Gentiles, using <span class= "ital">p?lon, "</span>steed," or the general word <span class= "ital">hupozugion, </span>"beast of burden," instead. No incident was more derided among the Gentiles than the riding to Zion of her king, "meek and sitting upon an ass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>), (see the <span class= "ital">Life of Christ, </span>2:197). Here though the Alexandrine MS. of the LXX has "on female asses of the South "--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of Ethiopia--we find in other MSS. "on beasts of burden."<p><span class= "bld">Ye that sit in judgment.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">ye that sit on rich divans, </span>though our version follows the Vatican MS. of <span class= "ital">the </span>LXX., the Chaldee, and the Vulgate. The Hebrew is, <span class= "ital">"</span>ye that sit on <span class= "ital">middin," </span>and some Jews understood it to mean "at <span class= "ital">Middin</span>"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>ye inhabitants of the town Middin (which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm" title="In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,">Joshua 15:61</a>, and which they suppose may have been peculiarly oppressed and insulted by the enemy). Others, again, suppose that <span class= "ital">middin </span>is saddle-cloths (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-7.htm" title="And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.">Matthew 21:7</a>). The Alexandrine MS. of the LXX. has <span class= "ital">epi lampenom</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on sedans or covered chariots. There can be little doubt that it means "bright carpets" (compare <span class= "ital">mad </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-18.htm" title="As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.">Psalm 109:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And walk by the way.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">ye that walk in the way. </span>Deborah appeals (1) to the wealthy, riding through the safe highways: (2) to those of all classes who now sit at ease on divans, bright with carpets, of which Easterns are so fond: and (3) to foot-passengers in the ordinary life--to join in the thought and song of praise. On the phrases "sitting at home and "walking on the roads" to describe the ordinary avocations of life, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm" title="And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> : "When thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - She appeals to the nobles who ride on white (or roan) asses, and sit on rich saddle-cloths (not <span class="accented">sit in judgment</span>), and to the people who walk by the way, alike to speak of the great deliverance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-11. Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny of Jabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows what brought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose new gods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped. Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvation of their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of this great salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as are restored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to their rank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts of his, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution, God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life are drawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attend them. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer from drawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to his trembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are most exposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we have from the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and give God the praise.</body></html>
