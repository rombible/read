and the names of Shamgar and Jael are mentioned to enhance the glory of Deborah, by showing that even the presence among the Israelites of two such heroic souls as Shamgar and Jael was unavailing to deliver them until Deborah arose. That Shamgar is thus (apparently) alluded to as a contemporary of Jael has an important bearing on the chronology; for it at least shows that simultaneous struggles may have been going on against the Philistines in the south and the Canaanites in the north.<p><span class= "bld">In the days of Jael.</span>--It has been thought so strange that Deborah should mention the name of the Bedouin chieftainess as marking the epoch, that some have supposed "Jael" to be the name of some unknown judge; and some have even proposed to read Jair. Others render it "the helper," and suppose that Ehud, or Shamgar, is referred to. But (1) Jael is essentially a woman's name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Judges 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-19.htm" title="Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.">Proverbs 5:19</a>); (2) she is mentioned prominently in this very song as having put the finishing stroke to the victory of Israel; and (3) she may have been--and various incidents in the history lead us to suppose that she was--a woman of great importance and influence, even independently of her murder of Sisera.<p><span class= "bld">The highways were unoccupied.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">kept holiday. </span>This had been foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm" title="I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.">Leviticus 26:22</a>. The grass grew on them; there was no one to occupy them. "The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm" title="The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: he has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he regards no man.">Isaiah 33:8</a>). "The land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-14.htm" title="But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.">Zechariah 7:14</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-5.htm" title="And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were on all the inhabitants of the countries.">2Chronicles 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-4.htm" title="The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.">Lamentations 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-18.htm" title="They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.">Lamentations 4:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Travellers.</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">walkers of paths. </span>Those of the unhappy conquered race whose necessities obliged them to journey from one place to another could only slink along, unobserved, by twisted--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>tortuous, devious--bye-lanes. A traveller in America was reminded of this verse when he saw the neutral ground in 1780, with "houses plundered and dismantled, enclosures broken down, cattle carried away, fields lying waste, the roads grass-grown, the country mournful, solitary, silent."--(Washington Irving's "Life of Washington," ch. 137)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - From what misery God had saved the people! In the days of her predecessor Shamgar, when the Philistines overran the country, when Heber the Kenite still dwelt in the south of Judah, all traffic ceased in the land. The caravans were stopped, and travellers slunk into the by-ways. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-11. Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny of Jabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows what brought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose new gods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped. Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvation of their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of this great salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as are restored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to their rank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts of his, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution, God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life are drawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attend them. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer from drawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to his trembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are most exposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we have from the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and give God the praise.</body></html>
