After thee, O Ephraim, came down Benjamin, mingled with thy people. The forces of "little Benjamin" are overshadowed by, and almost lost in, the crowded ranks of its powerful neighbour-tribe. In after days Benjamin clung to the skirts of Judah, but at this period his fortunes were more allied with those of Ephraim. "After thee, Benjamin," seems to have become (perhaps from this allusion) a war-cry of the tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-8.htm" title="Blow you the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after you, O Benjamin.">Hosea 5:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Out of Machir came down governors.--</span>Machir was the only son of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-23.htm" title="And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.">Genesis 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1</a>), and is here used for the Western Manassites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-5.htm" title="And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;">Joshua 17:5</a>). The Eastern half-tribe, no doubt, held aloof with Gad and Reuben. The silence respecting Judah is remarkable. We may conjecture that Judah and Simeon were sufficiently occupied in keeping off the Philistines, or that, having secured their own territory, they remained in selfish isolation. The word rendered "governors" (LXX., "searchers out"; Vulgate, "princes ") is more strictly "law-givers" (Sym-machus, <span class= "ital">entassontes</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">They that handle the pen of the writer.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">they who draw with the staff </span>(<span class= "ital">sh?bet</span>)<span class= "ital"> of the scribe </span>(<span class= "ital">soph?r</span>)<span class= "ital">. Soph?r </span>may mean scribe (literally, "one who counts "), and the verb rendered "handle" is, literally, "draw;" but <span class= "ital">sh?bet </span>can hardly mean "pen"; nor is it easy to say of what special use "the pen of the writer" would be in the gathering of clans to battle; nor have we the faintest indication that Zebulon had any literary pre-eminence. There can be little doubt that the meaning is, "They who lead (so in Latin, <span class= "ital">traho </span>sometimes has the meaning of <span class= "ital">duco</span>) with the staff of the marshal." The <span class= "ital">soph?r </span>is the officer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-19.htm" title="And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and three score men of the people of the land that were found in the city:">2Kings 25:19</a>) who musters, and therefore naturally counts and enrols, the host ( <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-25.htm" title="He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and three score men of the people of the land, that were found in the middle of the city.">Jeremiah 52:25</a>), and the staff: is his natural "rod of power," or ensign of office; just as it-was (<span class= "ital">vitis, </span>Plin., <span class= "ital">H.

He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.</body></html>
