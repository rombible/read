The Chaldee paraphrases it, "the torrent on whose banks illustrious deeds have been done from the ancient times of Israel." As the Plain of Jezreel has been in all ages the battle-field of Israel, the Kishon must always have played an important part in these struggles, as when the Turks were drowned in its swollen waves on April 16th, 1799. We know, however, of no ancient fame of Kishon before these events; and some render it. "the torrent of meeting armies," or "of slaughters" (Ewald), deriving <span class= "ital">Kedumim </span>from an Arabic root; or "the torrent of succours," connecting the word with <span class= "ital">Kiddeem </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm" title="O remember not against us former iniquities: let your tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.">Psalm 79:8</a>, &c., Heb.).

The verb may be an imperative, and the Vulgate renders it, "Trample down, O my soul, the mighty." The word "trample" recalls the image of treading the vintage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ancient</span>. The word so rendered is only found here. <span class="accented">The brook of ancient</span> days, or things, probably means the brook celebrated from of old by the warlike deeds done on its banks. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-23 Deborah called on her own soul to be in earnest. He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.</body></html>
