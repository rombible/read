The Syriac and Vulgate render it "God chose new things," or "wars" (<span class= "ital">nova bella elegit Dominus, </span>Vulg.); but this gives a poorer sense, and is open to the objection that <span class= "ital">Jehovah, </span>not <span class= "ital">Elohim, </span>is used throughout the rest of the song. It alludes to the idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm" title="Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.">Jeremiah 2:11</a>) which brought the retribution described in the next clause. Ewald and his pupil, Bertheau, render "gods" (Elohim) by "judges;" but this is very doubtful, though the word has that meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-7.htm" title="If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.">Exodus 22:7-8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Then was war in the gates.</span>--The Canaanites drove the Israelites from the city gates, where judgments were given, and expelled them from their towns; so the Targum explains it to mean, "the storming of gates," and so too Rabbi Tanchum. One MS. of the LXX. and the Syriac and Arabic versions have the strange rendering, "they chose new gods <span class= "ital">like barley bread," </span>which Theodoret explains to mean, "as though after eating wheaten bread, men would voluntarily descend to coarse barley bread"; but this is only due to an inferior reading.<p><span class= "bld">Was there a shield or spear.</span>--This is usually, and not unnaturally, explained to mean that there had been a general disarmament (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm" title="And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.">Judges 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm" title="Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:">1Samuel 13:19</a>); we must then assume that the Israelites had only bows, slings, and swords. But (1) there is no indication whatever (but rather the reverse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-15.htm" title="And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.">Judges 4:15</a>) that Barak's army--which, moreover, consisted of 10,000, not 40,000--was unarmed; and (2) the context seems to favour the meaning that, in spite of these degradations, there was not a warrior in all Israel who dared to put on his armour.<p><span class= "bld">Among forty thousand.</span>--Even if the number is meant as a round or general number, it is remarkable. It is true that though Barak only had 10,000 men with him, the contingents of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh are not counted; but even then the number shows that Israel was weakened and disunited, for the Transjordanic tribes alone had sent 40,000 men to help Joshua in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm" title="About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.">Joshua 4:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The cause of this misery was not far to seek; it was the idolatry of the people which provoked God to anger. Then their enemies were let loose upon them, and they dared make no resistance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:6-11. Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny of Jabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows what brought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose new gods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped. Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvation of their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of this great salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as are restored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to their rank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts of his, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution, God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life are drawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attend them. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer from drawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to his trembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are most exposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we have from the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and give God the praise.</body></html>
