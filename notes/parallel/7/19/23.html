Sometimes when crime is too dark and deadly for ordinary reproach the feelings are more deeply expressed by using a milder word, which is instantly corrected and intensified by the hearer himself. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-21.htm" title="Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has worked folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>.) Thus Virgil merely gives the epithet "unpraised" ("<span class= "ital">illaudati </span>Busiridis aras") to the cannibal tyrant, which serves even better than a stronger word. (Comp. "Shall I praise you for these things? <span class= "ital">I praise you not" </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.">1Corinthians 11:17-22</a>.) (See the author's <span class= "ital">Brief Greek Syntax, </span>p. 199.) This figure of speech takes the various form of antiphasis, litotes, meiosis, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - He pleads the sanctity of hospitality. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
