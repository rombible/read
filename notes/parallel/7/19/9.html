So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>, &c.) The Levite is conscious that if the father has been too pressing he has himself been too self-indulgent, and too fond of good living. "His experience is that of all weak and vacillating people: first, unnecessary delay, and then overstrained hurry."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draweth toward evening</span>. The Hebrew phrase, which is uncommon, is, The <span class="accented">day is slackening to become evening</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heat and the light of the day are becoming slack and weak, and evening is coming on. <span class="cmt_word">The day groweth to an end</span>. Another unusual phrase; literally, <span class="accented">Behold the declining of the day</span>, or, as some render it, <span class="accented">the encamping of the day</span>, as if the sun after his day's journey was now pitching his tent for the night. Go home. Literally, <span class="accented">to thy tent</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-8.htm">Judges 20:8</a>. So the phrase, <span class="accented">To your tents</span>, <span class="accented">O Israel</span>, means, <span class="cmt_word">Go home</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
