The word is not the name (as is supposed) of an evil spirit, but an ordinary noun, "sons of worthlessness," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"worthless fellows." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-14.htm" title="Then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is worked among you;">Deuteronomy 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm" title="The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.">Psalm 18:5</a>.) Later (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2Corinthians 6:15</a>) it became a kind of proper name. Josephus dishonestly suppresses all the darkest features of the story (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 11, ? 7).<p><span class= "bld">Beset the house.</span>--There is a close resemblance to the equally hideous narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-8.htm" title="Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do you to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.">Genesis 19:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Beat at the door.</span>--The word implies continuous knocking and gradual increase of noise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-2.htm" title="I sleep, but my heart wakes: it is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.">Song of Solomon 5:2</a>). We cannot wonder that the intense horror excited by this scene of infamy lasted for centuries afterwards. "They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm" title="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.">Hosea 9:9</a>). "O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-9.htm" title="O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.">Hosea 10:9</a>).<p>"And when night<p>Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons<p>Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.<p>Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night<p>In Gibeah, when the hospitable door<p>Exposed a matron to avoid worse rape."--<span class= "ital">Milton.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Making their hearts merry</span> - as in vers. 6, 9, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-7.htm">Ruth 3:7</a>. But there is nothing in the expression implying any excess in drinking. <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth the man</span>. The abandoned character of the men appears in this, that not only did they offer no hospitality to the stranger themselves, but were ready to violate the sanctity of the hospitality of the old man's house by their brutal violence. There must have been a fearful absence of all law and order and government when such deeds could be done without any interference on the part of magistrate or elder or ruler of any kind. The singular resemblance of the whole narrative to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. suggests that the Israelites by their contact with the accursed Canaanites had reduced themselves to the level of Sodom and Gomorrah. Surely this shows the wisdom of the command to destroy utterly the workers of abomination. <span class="cmt_word">Sons of Belial</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-13.htm">Judges 20:13</a>, where the same Hebrew phrase is rendered <span class="accented">children of Belial.</span> Belial in this common phrase is not a proper name, but a noun meaning <span class="accented">worthlessness. </span> Sons or men of Belial means worthless fellows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
