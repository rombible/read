<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm" title="By your servants have you reproached the Lord, and have said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.">Isaiah 37:24</a>.) As to the residence of the Levite at Mount Ephraim, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-8.htm" title="And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.">Judges 17:8</a>. It is probably a fortuitous coincidence that both this Levite and Jonathan have relations with Mount Ephraim and with Bethlehem.<p><span class= "bld">Took to him a concubine.</span>--Such connections were not legally forbidden; yet it is probable that in the case of all but princes or eminent men they were looked on with moral disapprobation.

It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27, 28</a> that the events narrated in these three last chapters of the Book of Judges happened in the lifetime of Phinehas, and while the ark was at Shiloh (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). Phinehas evidently outlived Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29, 33</a>), though there is no evidence to show how long. The events in these chapters must have occurred in the interval between the death of Joshua and the death of Phinehas. <span class="cmt_word">A certain Levite</span>, etc. It is a curious coincidence that both the Levite whose sad story is here told, and the Levite the son of Gershom of whom we read in the preceding chapters, were sojourners in the hill country of Ephraim, and also closely connected with Bethlehem-judah. Perhaps the legitimate inference (see ver. 18, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26, 27</a>) is that in both cases the Levites were drawn to Ephraim by the ark being at Shiloh, and also that there was a colony of Levites at Bethlehem-judah. Whether there was any connection between the presence of Levites at Bethlehem and the annual sacrifice at Bethlehem which existed in David's time, and which argues the existence of a high place there, can only be a matter of conjecture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>, and 1 Samuel 20:29). All we can say is that there was the universal prevalence of high-place worship during the time of the judges, and that the services of Levites were sought after in connection with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-13.htm">Judges 17:13</a>). On the side. Hebrew, sides. In the masculine form the word means the hip and upper part of the thigh; in the feminine, as here, it is applied only to inanimate objects, as a house, the temple, a cave, the north, a pit, a country, etc., and is used in the dual number (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-23.htm">Ezekiel 32:23</a>, etc.). It means the innermost, hindmost, furthermost parts. Its application here to the northern side of Ephraim seems to imply that the writer wrote in the south, probably in Judah. <span class="cmt_word">A concubine</span>. An inferior wife, who had not the same right for herself or for her children as the <span class="accented">wife</span> had (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
