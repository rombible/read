The story of the deed thrilled through all Palestine and awoke a determined desire for retribution upon the guilty inhabitants of Gibeah. The whole nation felt the stain and shame (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm" title="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.">Hosea 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-9.htm" title="O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.">Hosea 10:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was so</span>, etc. Some translate this verse quite differently. They understand the whole verse as what the Levite said when he sent the twelve pieces of the murdered woman to the twelve tribes, as thus: "<span class="accented">He sent her into all the coasts of Israel</span> (ver. 29), saying, <span class="accented">It shall come to pass that all who see it will say</span>, <span class="accented">There hath been nothing done and nothing seen like this from</span> the day, etc. But the A.V. makes very good sense, and the Hebrew will bear it. <span class="cmt_word">Consider of it</span>, etc. The general sense of the whole nation was to call a national council to decide what to do. The Levite had succeeded in arousing the indignation of the twelve tribes to avenge his terrible wrong. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
