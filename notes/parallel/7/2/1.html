of prophets in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-19.htm" title="Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm" title="For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.">Malachi 3:6</a>; of priests in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a>. Hence from very ancient times these words have been interpreted as, "a messenger of the Lord" (as in the margin of our Bible). The Targum paraphrases it by "a prophet with a message from Jehovah." R. Tanchum, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.">Judges 2:6</a>, infers that it was Joshua himself. Kimchi and others have supposed that it was Phinehas. No indications are given of anything specially miraculous. On the other hand, there is much room to suppose that the writer intended "the Angel of the Presence," because ( 1 ) he constantly uses the phrase in this sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/6-11.htm" title="And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.">Judges 6:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/6-21.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.">Judges 6:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bore not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son.">Judges 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-13.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.">Judges 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm" title="And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.">Judges 13:15</a>, &c.); (2) the same phrase occurs in this sense elsewhere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.">Genesis 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-2.htm" title="And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.">Exodus 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm" title="And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm" title="And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.">Exodus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.">Numbers 22:22</a>, &c; (3) the angel speaks in the first person, and does not introduce his words by "Thus saith Jehovah," as the prophets always do (but see below). It seems probable, therefore, that by "the angel of the Lord" the writer meant "the captain of the Lord's host," who appeared to Joshua at Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13-15</a>). Against this conclusion may be urged the fact that in no other instance does an angel appear to, or preach to, multitudes. Angels are sent to individuals, but prophets to nations.<p><span class= "bld">Came up from Gilgal to Bochim.</span>--This notice is by no means <span class= "ital">decisive </span>against the conclusion that an angel is intended. The writer may mean to intimate that the Angel Prince of the host (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.">Exodus 23:20-23</a>), the Angel of the Covenant, left his station in the camp of Gilgal and came up to the new camp or assembly of the people in Central Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm" title="And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.">Joshua 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/5-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Why the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.">Joshua 5:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm" title="So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.">Joshua 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-15.htm" title="And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.">Joshua 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm" title="Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>). Ha-Bochim means "the weepers." The locality is not known, but the LXX. render it "to the weeping-place," and add "and to Bethel, and to the House of Israel." Hence it has been inferred that Bochim was near Bethel. Possibly however, the LXX. may have been led to this interpretation by the vicinity to Bethel of Allon-Bachuth, "the oak of weeping" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm" title="But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.">Genesis 35:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And said, I made you to go up out of Egypt.</span>--The LXX. have "the Lord, the Lord brought you out of Egypt" (Cod. Alex.). Houbigant, from the repetition of the word, precariously conjectures the loss of some words, "<span class= "ital">Thus saith the Lord, </span>I the Lord," &c., as in the Peshito; and, indeed, in some MSS. a blank (<span class= "ital">Piska</span>) is left, implying at least a suspicion that this formula has accidentally fallen out of the text.<p><span class= "bld">I will never break my covenant with you.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm" title="And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you, and to your seed after you.">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-12.htm" title="And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.">Genesis 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm" title="My mercy will I keep for him for ever more, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.">Psalm 89:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-34.htm" title="My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.">Psalm 89:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-54.htm" title="He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;">Luke 1:54-55</a>, &c; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/3-6.htm" title="Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.">Exodus 3:6-8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An angel of the Lord</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">the angel of the Lord</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the angel of his presence, whose message consequently is delivered as if the Lord himself were speaking (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7, 9, 11</a>, etc.). A good example of the difference between a message delivered by a prophet and one delivered by the angel of the Lord may be seen by comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-8.htm">Judges 6:8</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-16</a>. Bochim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> weepers (vers. 4, 5). The site is unknown, but it was probably near Shiloh. The phrase "came up" denotes that it was in the hill country. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 It was the great Angel of the covenant, the Word, the Son of God, who spake with Divine authority as Jehovah, and now called them to account for their disobedience. God sets forth what he had done for Israel, and what he had promised. Those who throw off communion with God, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, know not what they do now, and will have nothing to say for themselves in the day of account shortly. They must expect to suffer for this their folly. Those deceive themselves who expect advantages from friendship with God's enemies. God often makes men's sin their punishment; and thorns and snares are in the way of the froward, who will walk contrary to God. The people wept, crying out against their own folly and ingratitude. They trembled at the word, and not without cause. It is a wonder sinners can ever read the Bible with dry eyes. Had they kept close to God and their duty, no voice but that of singing had been heard in their congregation; but by their sin and folly they made other work for themselves, and nothing is to be heard but the voice of weeping. The worship of God, in its own nature, is joy, praise, and thanksgiving; our sins alone render weeping needful. It is pleasing to see men weep for their sins; but our tears, prayers, and even amendment, cannot atone for sin.</body></html>
