It was in Mount Ephraim, and in a rugged and barren district--a circumstance which raised the astonishment of Paula at the self-denial of Joshua (Jer., <span class= "ital">Ep. </span>108): "She was much astonished that the distributor of possessions had chosen rough mountain districts for himself."<p><span class= "bld">Timnath-heres.</span>--"The portion of the sun." This seems to be a mere "slip of the pen" (Ewald)--an accidental transposition of letters for <span class= "ital">Timnath-serah </span>("the portion that remains"), which is the reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-50.htm" title="According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelled therein.">Joshua 19:50</a>, and of the best versions, and of some MSS. here. The mistake is, however, ancient, for it originated the Rabbinic story that it is a reference to "the sun standing still upon Gibeah," and that the image of the sun (<span class= "ital">temunath ha-cheres</span>) was sculptured on his tomb. The LXX., after <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-30.htm" title="And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.">Joshua 24:30</a>, add the interesting <span class= "ital">Hagadah </span>(traditional legend), that the people buried in Joshua's tomb the flint knives with which they had performed the neglected rite of circumcision, after the passage of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-2.htm" title="At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make you sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.">Joshua 5:2</a>). The name Timnath has been, perhaps, preserved in the modern <span class= "ital">Tibneh, </span>about six miles from Shiloh. Its ruins yet contain some richly decorated tombs. There was another Timnath in Dan.<p><span class= "bld">The hill Gaash.</span>--The name means "mount earthquake." Its torrent beds are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-30.htm" title="Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,">2Samuel 23:30</a>. It has not been identified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Timnath-heres</span>. Probably, though not certainly, the modern <span class="accented">Tibneh</span>, six miles from Jifna. It is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a> and Joshua 24:30 <span class="accented">Timnath-serah</span>, the letters of which are identical, but the order is inverted. <span class="accented">Timnath-heres is</span> probably the right form. It means "The portion of the Sun." We have <span class="accented">Mount Heres</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>, near Ajalon. <span class="accented">Ir-shemesh</span> (city of the sun) and <span class="accented">Beth-shemesh</span> (house of the sun) are other instances of places called from the sun. Some have supposed some connection between the name <span class="accented">Timnath. heres</span>, as Joshua's inheritance, and the miracle of the sun standing still upon Gibeon at the word of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12, 13</a>). The neighbourhood of Timnath-heres to Ajalon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>) may give some countenance to this. The hill Gaash is only elsewhere mentioned as the birthplace of Hiddai or Hurai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-30.htm">2 Samuel 23:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-32.htm">1 Chronicles 11:32</a>), but the exact site is unknown. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-23 We have a general idea of the course of things in Israel, during the time of the Judges. The nation made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil they had done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, even the meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations round about them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to his promises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it. The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they became saviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, there shall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israelites were not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the good ways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Their punishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they were beaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corrupt appetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves, under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find it true by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand with ourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted and grounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Let us declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all our days.</body></html>
