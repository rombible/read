The plural form may be, as Ewald thinks, the plural of excellence, or like Baalim an allusion to the different forms and attributes under which the goddess was worshipped. The worship of Baalim and Ashtaroth naturally went hand in hand. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm" title="Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.">1Samuel 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm" title="And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.">1Samuel 12:10</a>.) Ashtaroth is not to be confused with the Asheroth (rendered "groves" in the E. V.) mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>. The words resemble each other less in Hebrew, as Ashtaroth begins with <span class= "greekheb"></span>, not with <span class= "greekheb"></span>. Mil. ton's allusions to these deities are not only exquisitely beautiful but also very correct, as he derived his information from Selden's learned <span class= "ital">Syntagma de Dis Syrs:</span><p>"With these in troop<p>Came Ashtoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd<p>Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns,<p>To whose bright image nightly by the moon<p>Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;<p>In Zion also not unsung, where stood<p>Her temple."<p><span class= "ital">Par.

It probably has no connection with the Greek <span class= "ital">Aster, </span>or the Persian Esther.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baal and Ashtaroth</span>. <span class="accented">Ashtaroth</span> is the plural of <span class="accented">Ashtoreth</span>, the goddess of the Zidonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5, 33</a>), just as <span class="accented">Baalim</span> (ver. 11) is the plural of Baal. The many images of Baal and Ashtoreth are, in the opinion of some, indicated by the plural; but others think that different modifications or impersonations of the god and goddess are indicated. Thus we read of <span class="accented">Baal-berith</span>, the god who presides over covenants; <span class="accented">Baal-zebul</span>, or <span class="accented">Zebub</span>, the god who presides over flies, who could either send or remove a plague of flies, and so on. "Baal (lord or master) was the supreme male divinity of the Phoenician and Canaanitish nations, as Ashtoreth (perhaps <span class="accented">the star</span>, the planet Venus) was their supreme female divinity. Baal and Ashtoreth are frequently coupled together. Many Phoenician names - Hannibal, Asdrubal, Adherbal, Belus, etc. - are derived from Baal." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:14-23 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-23 We have a general idea of the course of things in Israel, during the time of the Judges. The nation made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil they had done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, even the meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations round about them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to his promises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it. The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they became saviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, there shall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israelites were not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the good ways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Their punishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they were beaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corrupt appetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves, under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find it true by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand with ourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted and grounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Let us declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all our days.</body></html>
