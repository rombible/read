This is the key-note to the book. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-2.htm" title="And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.">Judges 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-7.htm" title="And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.">Judges 12:7</a>, &c.; 15:20.) The word for <span class= "ital">Judges </span>is <span class= "ital">Shophetim. </span>The ordinary verb "to judge," in Hebrew, is not <span class= "ital">Shaphat, </span>but <span class= "ital">dayyan. </span>Evidently their deliverers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/17-8.htm" title="If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;">Deuteronomy 17:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-10.htm" title="Be wise now therefore, O you kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth.">Psalm 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm" title="And I will cut off the judge from the middle thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, said the LORD.">Amos 2:3</a>) are of higher rank than the mere tribe-magistrates mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-26.htm" title="And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.">Exodus 18:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm" title="And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.">Deuteronomy 1:16</a><span class= "ital">, </span>&c. Artemidorus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-14.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.">Judges 2:14</a>) says that to judge (<span class= "ital">Krinein</span>) signified among the ancients "to govern." Of the judges in this book some--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Tola, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon--are not said to have performed any warlike deeds. They <span class= "ital">may, </span>however, have been warriors, like Jair, whose exploits are only preserved in tradition. Samuel, though not himself a fighter, yet roused the military courage of his people. They received no salary, imposed no tributes, made no laws, but merely exercised, for the deliverance of Israel, the personal ascendency conferred upon them by "the Spirit of God." Perhaps they find their nearest analogy in the Greek <span class= "ital">Aisymnetai </span>(elective princes) or the Roman <span class= "ital">Dictators. </span>The name is evidently the same as that of the Ph?nician <span class= "ital">Suffetes, </span>who succeeded the kings and were the Doges of Tyre after its siege by Nebuchadnezzar. (Jos. <span class= "ital">100 Ap. i.</span> 21.) Livy tells us that the Suffetes of Carthage had a sort of consular power in the senate (Liv. 30:7; 28:57; 33:46; 34:61). So, too, in the Middle Ages, Spanish governors were called "judges," and this was the title of the chief officer of Sardinia. The judges of Israel, at any rate in their true ideal, were not only military deliverers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>), but also supporters of divine law and order (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>). The abeyance of normally constituted authority during this period is seen in the fact that one of the judges is the son of a "stranger" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-2.htm" title="And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of a strange woman.">Judges 11:2</a>), another a woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>), and not one of them (in this book) of priestly or splendid birth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Raised up judges</span>. Hence the name of this book, which recites the names and exploits of those whom God raised up to deliver them out of the hand of their enemies. The title Judges (Hebrew, <span class="accented">shophetim</span>) is, as is well known, identical with the Carthagenian <span class="accented">suffetes.</span> Mark the riches of God's mercy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-23 We have a general idea of the course of things in Israel, during the time of the Judges. The nation made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil they had done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, even the meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations round about them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to his promises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it. The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they became saviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, there shall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israelites were not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the good ways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Their punishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they were beaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corrupt appetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves, under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find it true by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand with ourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted and grounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Let us declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all our days.</body></html>
