The threshing-floors--open circular places in the fields where the corn was trodden out by oxen--would naturally be the first places where an invading enemy would come to forage, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-1.htm" title="Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.">1Samuel 23:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An angel</span>, etc. Rather, the <span class="accented">angel of the Lord</span>, otherwise called "the angel of his presence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>). In vers. 14, 16, 23, for <span class="accented">the angel of the Lord</span> we have simply <span class="accented">the Lord</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">An oak</span>. Rather <span class="accented">the oak</span>, or <span class="accented">terebinth</span>, as it should be rendered. It was doubtless a well-known tree still standing in the writer's time (see ver. 19). Compare the mention of <span class="accented">the oak</span> (terebinth) at Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>); <span class="accented">the great oak</span> (terebinth) in which Absalom was caught (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>); <span class="accented">Deborah's palm tree</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>, where see note). Observe the simple way in which the ministration of the angel is introduced, as if it were a matter of course in the eyes of him who is the Lord of the millions of the heavenly host, those ministers of his who do his pleasure. Human scepticism, the twin sister of human selfishness, would blot out all creation except itself. <span class="cmt_word">To hide it</span>, etc. These graphic touches give a lively picture of the straits to which the Israelites were reduced by the Midianite occupation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-24 Gideon was a man of a brave, active spirit, yet in obscurity through the times: he is here stirred up to undertake something great. It was very sure that the Lord was with him, when his Angel was with him. Gideon was weak in faith, which made it hard to reconcile the assurances of the presence of God with the distress to which Israel was brought. The Angel answered his objections. He told him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer, there needed no more. Bishop Hall says, While God calls Gideon valiant, he makes him so. God delights to advance the humble. Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed. Now, under the influences of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs before our eyes such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God, that if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign in our heart, by the powerful working of his Spirit there, The Angel turned the meat into an offering made by fire; showing that he was not a man who needed meat, but the Son of God, who was to be served and honoured by sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a sacrifice. Hereby a sign was given to Gideon, that he had found grace in God's sight. Ever since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse, a message from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to expect good tidings thence. In this world, it is very awful to have any converse with that world of spirits to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him. But God spoke peace to him.</body></html>
