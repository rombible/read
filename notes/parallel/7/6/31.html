They may mean, "to all that stood around."<p><span class= "bld">Will ye plead for Baal?</span>--The pronoun <span class= "ital">ye </span>is very emphatic, being twice expressed in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">He that will plead for him, let him be put to death.</span>--These words of Joash were extraordinarily bold and cunning. Possibly the brave act of his son may have roused his conscience, and Gideon may have told him that he had acted under Divine guidance. But he saves his son's life, not by excusing his act, but by feigning such a zeal for Baal as to denounce it as a blasphemous impiety to suppose that Baal will not avenge his own insult--an impiety <span class= "ital">so </span>monstrous, that the man who was guilty of it should be at once put to death. Thus he made Baal-worship a plea for <span class= "ital">not </span>avenging the insult offered to Baal. He was well aware that if he thus gained time, the fact that Baal did <span class= "ital">not </span>interfere to protect himself from such fearful outrage would weigh powerfully with all his worshippers. Among idolaters the sight of an act of open contempt for their idol often shakes their superstitious reverence. Aristophanes, Persius, and Lucian sneer at the inability of Jupiter to defend his own temple, golden locks, and golden beard. When Olaf had the huge image of Odin destroyed, and when the high priest Coifi at Saxmundham, clad in armour and mounted on horseback (two things which were forbidden to a priest), rode up to the Saxon idols and hurled them down, the people, seeing that no thunder followed, but that all went on as well as usual, were quite ready to embrace Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">Whilst it is yet morning.</span>--The Hebrew is <span class= "ital">ad habb?ker </span>("until morning"); LXX., <span class= "ital">he?s pr?i, </span>which may mean, "before to-morrow's sun has dawned." (<span class= "ital">Antequan lux crastina veniat, </span>Vulg.; as also the Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee.) It is a much more likely rendering than that of the E.V., for it implies, "Let us wait till to-morrow, to see whether Baal will avenge himself." Joash knew that in popular outbreaks procrastination means security.<p><span class= "bld">If he be a god.</span>--Compare the language of Elijah to the Baal and Asherah priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm" title="And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.">1Kings 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm" title="And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleeps, and must be awaked.">1Kings 18:27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stood against him</span>. The words describe their hostile, menacing, attitude, clamouring to have Gideon brought out that they might kill him. <span class="cmt_word">Will ye plead</span>, etc. The emphasis is on the <span class="accented">ye.</span> Joash met and silenced their pleading by threatening death to any that should plead for Baal. Baal shall plead for himself. Joash's courage was rising under the influence of his son s brave deed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:25-32 See the power of God's grace, that he could raise up a reformer; and the kindness of his grace, that he would raise up a deliverer, out of the family of a leader in idolatry. Gideon must not think it enough not to worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice on another. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, no good is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands, influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal, though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do our duty, and trust God with our safety. Here is a challenge to Baal, to do either good or evil; the result convinced his worshippers of their folly, in praying to one to help them that could not avenge himself.</body></html>
