It is possible that the name may have been yet more allusive, since from the Palmyrene inscriptions it appears that there was a deity named <span class= "ital">Jaribolos </span>(Mover's <span class= "ital">Ph�nizier, </span>1:434). If in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm" title="Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.">2Samuel 11:21</a> we find the name <span class= "ital">Jerubbesheth, </span>this is only due to the fondness of the Jews for avoiding the names of idols, and changing them into terms of insult. It was thus that they literally interpreted the law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm" title="And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.">Exodus 23:13</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm" title="That you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:">Joshua 23:7</a>). It was a part of that <span class= "ital">contumelia numinum </span>with which the ancients charged them (Plin. xiii. 9). I have adduced other instances in <span class= "ital">Language and Languages, </span>p. 232. (Longmans.) Bosheth means "shame," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"that shameful thing," and was a term of scorn for Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm" title="I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves to that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.">Hosea 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm" title="For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.">Jeremiah 11:13</a>). We have two other instances of this change in the case of the sons of Saul. Whether from a faithless syncretism, or a tendency to downright apostasy, he called one of his sons Esh-baal, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"man of Baal," and another Merib-baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/8-33.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1Chronicles 8:33-34</a>); but the Jews angrily and contemptuously changed these names into Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.">2Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.">2Samuel 4:4</a>). Ewald, however, and others have conjectured that both Baal and Bosheth may, at one time, have had more harmless associations (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm" title="And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth on my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.">2Samuel 5:20</a>), and it appears that there was a Baal among the ancestors of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm" title="And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,">1Chronicles 8:30</a>). The LXX. write the name Hierobalos; and Eusebius (Praep. Evang. i. 9), quoting from Philo Byblius, tells us that a Gentile historian named Sanchoniatho, of Berytus, whom he praises for his accuracy in Jewish history and geography, had received assistance "from Hierombalos, the priest of the god Iao." Some have supposed that this is an allusion to Gideon, under the name Jerubbaal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerubbaal</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">Jarov Baal</span>, let Baal plead.

Gideon must not think it enough not to worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice on another. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, no good is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands, influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal, though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do our duty, and trust God with our safety. Here is a challenge to Baal, to do either good or evil; the result convinced his worshippers of their folly, in praying to one to help them that could not avenge himself.</body></html>
