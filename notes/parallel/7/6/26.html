The LXX. render it as a proper name (<span class= "ital">maoz</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>or in some MSS., <span class= "ital">"</span>on the top of this mountain." The word only occurs elsewhere in Hebrew poetry.<p><span class= "bld">In the ordered place.</span>--The margin reads, "in an orderly manner;" but probably neither version is quite correct.

That the Jews themselves were not quite certain of the meaning appears from the various versions. The LXX. render it, "in the arrangement," and the Vulg., "on which you have before placed the sacrifice." It means "with the Asherah pillar hewed down, and split up into firewood." The Jews point out the peculiar features of this burnt offering: (1) It was not at Shiloh; (2) it was not offered by a priest; (3) it was offered at night; and (4) the fire was kindled with the unhallowed materials of an idol. The Divine command was, of course, more than sufficient to justify these merely ritual irregularities; and, indeed, it is clear that in these rude times, when the country was in the hands of the heathen, the Levitic order of worship became, for the time, impossible in many particulars. Prophets and those directly commissioned by heaven were tacitly regarded as exempt from the strict rules of outward ritual which were necessary for the mass of the nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This rock</span>. Rather, the keep or <span class="accented">stronghold</span> of Ophrah, where also the high place was; just as the temple was in the stronghold of Zion, and the hold of the house of Baal-Berith at Shechem was in the citadel of the place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a>). In the ordered place. The meaning of this phrase is uncertain. It may either be rendered as in the A.V., meaning on the levelled ground ordered and prepared for the building of the altar; or it may more probably be rendered <span class="accented">with the arranged</span> material, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the stones which were laid in order at the bottom, and the wood which was laid in order upon the top of the altar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>). The <span class="accented">material</span> may either refer to that taken from the altar of Baal, which had been thrown down, and which was then ordered to be used in building the altar of the Lord, or to its own <span class="accented">arranged material</span> or <span class="accented">superstructure</span>, the wood of the <span class="accented">asherah.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:25-32 See the power of God's grace, that he could raise up a reformer; and the kindness of his grace, that he would raise up a deliverer, out of the family of a leader in idolatry. Gideon must not think it enough not to worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice on another. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, no good is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands, influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal, though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do our duty, and trust God with our safety. Here is a challenge to Baal, to do either good or evil; the result convinced his worshippers of their folly, in praying to one to help them that could not avenge himself.</body></html>
