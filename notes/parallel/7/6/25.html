It is useless, and therefore undesirable, to speculate as to the exact manner in which the Divine intimation came to him. When God speaks it is not possible for man to mistake His voice. It was distinctly revealed to Gideon that he must be an iconoclast before he could be a deliverer.<p><span class= "bld">Even the second bullock.</span>--It has been disputed whether the true rendering is "<span class= "ital">even" </span>or "and." Ewald makes it mean "even," and explains <span class= "ital">shani </span>(second) to mean "old" (<span class= "ital">Gesch. </span>ii.498). The LXX., the Vulgate, Luther, &c, render it "<span class= "ital">and," </span>as in the margin of our version. This seems to be the right rendering; for (1) the labour of two bullocks would not be too much for the task before Gideon; (2) a bullock (<span class= "ital">shor</span>) of seven years old would hardly be called a <span class= "ital">young </span>bullock: literally, "a heifer (<span class= "ital">par</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>son of an ox."<p><span class= "bld">Of seven years old.</span>--The Chaldee renders it, "which has been fattened for seven years," and there is very possibly an allusion to the seven years of the Midianite oppression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.">Judges 6:1</a>). The law had not prescribed any fixed age for burnt offerings. Why the bullock is called <span class= "ital">"</span>the second bullock" is very uncertain, but this minute and unexplained detail shows that we are not moving in the region of legend. The first bullock is said to belong to Joash, and we must, therefore, probably suppose that the second was Gideon's own. Possibly in this circumstance we may see an explanation of these minute directions, and the significance which they were intended to bear. The first bullock had been intended by Joash as a sacrifice to Baal, and <span class= "ital">is </span>used in the destruction of his altar; the <span class= "ital">second </span>had, perhaps, been reserved by Gideon as a sacrifice to the Lord when better times should come--a votive offering, which was being fattened for the longed-for day of deliverance. This bullock is sacrificed to Jehovah, and the fact that it, too, has been used for the destruction of the Canaanite idols is a sign to Gideon that the day for which he had hoped has come.<p><span class= "bld">Throw down.</span>--As commanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm" title="Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.">Exodus 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The altar of Baal.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">of the Baal, i.e., </span>of that particular Ph?nician idol which your father worships. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-32.htm" title="And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.">1Kings 16:32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That thy father hath.</span>--This shows that Joash had joined with other Israelites in the apostasy, which had provoked the Midianite oppression. The words are literally, <span class= "ital">which is to thy father, </span>as in the previous clause; and the pointed repetition of these words tends to confirm the conjecture mentioned in the previous note. It is called especially Joash's altar because, though used by the whole city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>), he was the head of the Abi-ezrites.<p><span class= "bld">The grove.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the Asherah, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>. Baal, <span class= "ital">"</span>the sun," and the nature goddess Asherah--who is often confused with Astarte--were worshipped in conjunction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-6.htm" title="Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)">2Kings 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-16.htm" title="At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.">2Kings 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/24-3.htm" title="Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;">2Kings 24:3-6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That is by it.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">that is upon it. </span>No mention is made of the image of Baal. Possibly the sun was worshipped at this altar without any idol, and the Asherah--perhaps a mere wooden pillar or gross emblem of phallic nature-worship--was placed upon it. It was the first law of God's worship that He was <span class= "ital">one </span>God and therefore "jealous" against that easy combination of idolatries which is common to all forms of Polytheism. "Baal's altar must be overthrown before God's altar is built."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The grove</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>. The size of the <span class="accented">asherah</span> is indicated by the order in ver. 26 to use it for the altar fire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:25-32 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same night</span>, etc. The iron was hot; it was time to strike. As regards what follows, there are two ways of understanding the verse. One, that of the A.V., supposes that only one bullock is spoken of, and that "<span class="accented">the</span> young bullock" belonging to Joash is further described as "even the second bullock of seven years old;" to which it is objected that a bullock of seven years old is not "a young bullock," "the bullock of an <span class="accented">ox</span>," as the Hebrew phrase is, and that there is no explanation of the meaning of "the second bullock;" and that the Hebrew manifestly describes two bullocks: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Joash's young bullock, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the bullock of seven years old. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The other supposes two bullocks, and instead of has the more natural rendering and. The only objection to this, by far the most natural rendering, is that Gideon is not told what to do with the first bullock. But it is a simple explanation that the two bullocks were used in the laborious work of demolishing the altar of Baal, and removing the earth and the stone to build the altar of the Lord, and that when the work was finished one of the bullocks - the seven-year-old - was sacrificed. <span class="cmt_word">For the grove</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>, note. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:25-32 See the power of God's grace, that he could raise up a reformer; and the kindness of his grace, that he would raise up a deliverer, out of the family of a leader in idolatry. Gideon must not think it enough not to worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice on another. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, no good is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands, influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal, though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do our duty, and trust God with our safety. Here is a challenge to Baal, to do either good or evil; the result convinced his worshippers of their folly, in praying to one to help them that could not avenge himself.</body></html>
