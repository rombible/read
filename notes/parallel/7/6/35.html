This time Asher did not linger on the sands of Accho or the rocks of the Tyrian Ladder. Issachar, however, as before, "bowed his shoulder to the yoke." Perhaps the fact that the Plain of Jezreel, the battle-field of Palestine, was in the domains of this tribe, though not far from the border of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm" title="And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.">Joshua 17:16</a>), was unfavourable to their independence and strength.

This ready compliance with the call was the consequence of the Spirit of the Lord being upon Gideon. <span class="cmt_word">Came up</span>.

Gideon and his men were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made to know that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divine grace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause we sinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew of heavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all the inhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in different measures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation, one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dry ground.</body></html>
