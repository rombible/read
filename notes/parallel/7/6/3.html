Living in idleness and marauding expeditions, they let the Israelites sow their corn, and came themselves to reap and carry it away. They said, "Let us take to ourselves the pastures of God"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the rich, blessed pastures--"in possession" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-12.htm" title="Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.">Psalm 83:12</a>). Alyattes, king of Lydia, treated the people of Miletus in exactly the same way, leaving their houses un-destroyed, solely that they might be tempted to return to them, and plough and sow once more (Herod. i. 17). The same thing goes on to this day. The wretched Fellahin, neglected and oppressed by the effete and corrupt Turkish Government, sow their corn, with the constant dread that they are but sowing it for the Bedouin, who yearly plunder them, unrepressed and unpunished. Hence the squalid towns and villages of the Fellahin abound in huge subterranean places of concealment, in which they stow away their corn, and everything else of value which they possess, to save them from these wild marauders.<p><span class= "bld">The Amalekites.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The children of the east.</span>--Beni Kedem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm" title="But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.">Genesis 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm" title="His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.">Job 1:3</a>) is a general name for Arabs, as Josephus rightly calls them.
