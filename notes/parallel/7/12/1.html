No doubt the phrase arose from the circulation of some warlike summons--whether watchword or token--among the tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/7-23.htm" title="And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.">Judges 7:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm" title="Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.">Judges 10:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Northward.</span>--Mizpeh in Gilead lay to the northeast of the tribe of Ephraim. The Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">Tsaphonah, </span>rendered <span class= "ital">Sephenia </span>in some MSS. of the LXX. (Cod. A., <span class= "ital">Kephenia</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Hence some suppose that it means "towards Tsaphon," a town in the Jordan valley not far from Succoth, which the Jews identified with Amathus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm" title="And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.">Joshua 13:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And didst not call us.</span>--The tribe of Ephraim throughout the Book of Judges is represented in a most unenviable light--slothful and acquiescent in time of oppression, and turbulently arrogant when others have taken the initiative and won the victory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/17-14.htm" title="And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, for as much as the LORD has blessed me till now?">Joshua 17:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.">Judges 8:1</a>). They brought on their own heads the terrible disgrace and humiliation which Jephthah inflicted on them. They resembled Sparta in dilatoriness, and perhaps in courage; but when Athens had won Marathon, Sparta had at least the generosity to congratulate her (Herod. v. 20).<p><span class= "bld">We will burn thine house upon thee with fire</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., we will burn thee alive in thy house. </span>They regarded it as an unpardonable offence that Jephthah should have delivered Israel without recognising their <span class= "ital">hegemony </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.">Judges 8:1</a>). The horrible threat shows the wild manners of the times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?">Judges 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-6.htm" title="Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.">Judges 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm" title="And the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.">Judges 20:48</a>); and if a whole tribe could be guilty of such conduct, it shows how little cause we have for surprise at the much less heinous aberrations of individual men like Gideon and Jephthah and Samson.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Northward</span>, or, otherwise rendered, to <span class="accented">Zaphon</span>, a city of the Gadites mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> together with Succoth, and thought to be <span class="accented">the modern</span>, <span class="accented">Amateh</span> on the Wady Rajlb (see Vanderveld's map). It is difficult to say with certainty which rendering is right, but on the whole the latter seems most probable. Although Gilead does lie north-east of Ephraim, it hardly seems a natural description of the Ephraimite movement to say they "went northwards;" whereas if they marched to Zaphon the phrase would be precise. The previous phrase, <span class="cmt_word">gathered themselves together</span>, means <span class="accented">mustered for battle</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We will burn thine house</span>, etc. - the same savage threat as the Philistine youths made use of to induce Samson's wife to discover and reveal his riddle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>), and as the Philistines actually put in practice upon her and her father in revenge for the destruction of their corn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Passedst thou over</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-7 The Ephraimites had the same quarrel with Jephthah as with Gideon. Pride was at the bottom of the quarrel; only by that comes contention. It is ill to fasten names of reproach upon persons or countries, as is common, especially upon those under outward disadvantages. It often occasions quarrels that prove of ill consequence, as it did here. No contentions are so bitter as those between brethren or rivals for honour. What need we have to watch and pray against evil tempers! May the Lord incline all his people to follow after things which make for peace!</body></html>
