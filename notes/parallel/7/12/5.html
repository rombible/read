(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.">Judges 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm" title="And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.">Judges 7:24</a>.)

If the rendering of the English Version be adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm" title="Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.">Judges 12:4</a>, we can only suppose that there is a bitter retribution implied in the words. The Ephraimites had taunted the Eastern Manassites with being "fugitives of Ephraim," and in the next verse they themselves appear to be in another, but fatal, sense "fugitives of Ephraim."<p><span class= "bld">Art thou an Ephraimite?</span>--There must have been considerable traffic across the Jordan fords, and the object was to distinguish between Ephraimite fugitives and harmless travellers and merchants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-7 The Ephraimites had the same quarrel with Jephthah as with Gideon. Pride was at the bottom of the quarrel; only by that comes contention. It is ill to fasten names of reproach upon persons or countries, as is common, especially upon those under outward disadvantages. It often occasions quarrels that prove of ill consequence, as it did here. No contentions are so bitter as those between brethren or rivals for honour. What need we have to watch and pray against evil tempers! May the Lord incline all his people to follow after things which make for peace!</body></html>
