The notion that Ibhtsam (<span class= "greekheb">????</span>) is the same as Boaz (<span class= "greekheb">???????</span>) has nothing to support it.<p><span class= "bld">Of Beth-lehem.</span>--Usually assumed, as by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 7, ? 13), to be Bethlehem in Judah. There are, however, two reasons against the identification: (1) That Bethlehem is even in this book distinguished as Bethlehem Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm" title="And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.">Judges 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-9.htm" title="And Micah said to him, From where come you? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.">Judges 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm" title="And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.">Ruth 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm" title="Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.">1Samuel 17:12</a>), or Bethlehem Ephratah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm" title="Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops: he has laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.">Micah 5:1</a>); (2) Judah seems at this epoch to have stood entirely aloof from the general life of the nation. There was a Bethlehem in Zebulon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-15.htm" title="And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.">Joshua 19:15</a>), and as the next judge was a Zebulonite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-11.htm" title="And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.">Judges 12:11</a>), and that tribe had been recently powerful and prominent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-10.htm" title="And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.">Judges 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm" title="Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.">Judges 5:18</a>), it may be the town here intended.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ibzan of Bethlehem</span>. It is uncertain whether Bethlehem of Judah is meant, or Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebu-lun, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>. Josephus says that Ibzan was of the tribe of Judah, and of the city of Bethlehem, and some have supposed a connection between the names of Boaz and Ibzan. ' But as Bethlehem of the tribe of Judah is generally called Bethlehem of Judah, or Bethlehem-Ephratah, and as Elon and Abdon were judges in North-East Israel, it is perhaps more probable that Bethlehem of Zebulun is meant. Dr. Robinson has identified it with a village - a "very miserable one" - called <span class="accented">Beit Lahm</span>, six miles west of Nazareth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:8-15 We have here a short account of three more of the judges of Israel. The happiest life of individuals, and the happiest state of society, is that which affords the fewest remarkable events. To live in credit and quiet, to be peacefully useful to those around us, to possess a clear conscience; but, above all, and without which nothing can avail, to enjoy communion with God our Saviour while we live, and to die at peace with God and man, form the substance of all that a wise man can desire.</body></html>
