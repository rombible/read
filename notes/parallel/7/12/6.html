The LXX. render it (Cod. B) "an ear of corn" ( Vulg., <span class= "ital">quod interpretatur spica</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the word might have this meaning also (as it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-5.htm" title="And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, rank and good.">Genesis 41:5</a>), because the root from which it is derived means both "to flow" and "to spring." In the Alexandrian MS. of the LXX. the rendering is, "Tell us then the watchword;" but that is rather an explanation than a translation.<p><span class= "bld">And he said Sibboleth.</span>--<p>"And how ingrateful Ephraim<p>Had dealt with Jephthah--who by argument<p>Not worse than by his shield and spear<p>Defended Israel from the Ammonite<p>Had not his prowess quelled their pride<p>In that sore battle where so many died,<p>Without reprieve, adjudged to death<p>For want of well pronouncing Shibboleth."<p>Milton, <span class= "ital">Sams. Agon. </span>282-289.<p>The word <span class= "ital">Shibboleth </span>has become a proverb for the minute differences which religious parties thrust into exaggerated prominence, and defend with internecine ferocity. In this instance, however, the defective pronunciation was not the reason for putting men to death, but only the sign that the man is an Ephraimite. In theological warfare the differences of watchword or utterance have sometimes been the actual cause of the hatred and persecution; and sometimes the two opposing parties have been in agreement in every single essential fact, but have simply preferred other formulae to express it, which has failed to cause any diminution in the fierceness of opinions. "It was," says South, "the very <span class= "ital">shibboleth </span>of the party, nothing being so much in fashion with them as the name, nor more out of fashion, and out of sight too, as the thing itself" (<span class= "ital">Sermons, </span>6:128).<p><span class= "bld">For he could not frame to pronounce it right.�</span>--This is a most singular circumstance, and it is one which, if it stood alone, would have decisive weight in the question of chronology. Nothing is more natural or more analogous with common linguistic phenomena than that differences of dialect and pronunciation should develop themselves between tribes divided by the deep barrier of the Jordan valley; and these differences would arise all the more rapidly if the Eastern tribes were powerfully subjected to Syrian and other foreign influences. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-24.htm" title="And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.">Nehemiah 13:24</a>.) Still, it must have required a certain lapse of time before a difference so marked as the inability of the Western tribes to pronounce the letter <span class= "ital">sh </span>could have arisen ( Vulg., <span class= "ital">eadem litera spicam exprimere non valens</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Cassel quotes an interesting parallel from the war of the Flemish against the French. On May 25, 1802, all the French were detected by their inability to pronounce the words <span class= "ital">Scilt ende friend. </span>In the LXX. and Vulg. <span class= "ital">Shibboleth </span>could not be reproduced, because the sound <span class= "ital">sh </span>is unknown in Greek and Latin. Hence the LXX. use <span class= "ital">stachus, </span>"wheat-ear," for Shibboleth, and leave out <span class= "ital">Sibboleth </span>altogether.<p><span class= "bld">Slew him.</span>--We might wish that the meaning were that assigned to the word by the Arabic version, "they led him across." The word means, rather, <span class= "ital">massacred, butchered; </span>Vulg., <span class= "ital">jugulabant. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-6.htm" title="Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.">Jeremiah 39:6</a>.) The LXX. render it "sacrificed"--almost as though each Ephraimite were regarded as a human sacrifice.<p><span class= "bld">Forty and two thousand.</span>--This immense �slaughter effectually reduced the strength and arrogance of this overweening tribe. It is not, of course, meant that 42,000 were butchered at the fords, but only that that was the number of the invading army, or the number of those who fell in the campaign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say now Shibboleth</span>, etc. We have thus, as it were, accidentally preserved to us a curious dialectical difference between the Ephraimites and the inhabitants of Gilead. A similar difference exists at the present day between the pronunciation of the inhabitants of different parts of Germany. What the Hanoverians call <span class="accented">stein</span>, a stone, the other Germans call <span class="accented">shtein. Shibboleth</span> means both <span class="accented">an ear of corn</span> and <span class="accented">a stream. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Forty and two thousand</span>. It is possible that the war between Jephthah and the Ephraimites may have lasted a considerable time, though only the single incident of the slaughter at the fords of Jordan is mentioned, so that the large number of 42,000 men may be less improbable than it seems at first sight. There is, however, always some doubt as to the correctness of numbers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-7 The Ephraimites had the same quarrel with Jephthah as with Gideon. Pride was at the bottom of the quarrel; only by that comes contention. It is ill to fasten names of reproach upon persons or countries, as is common, especially upon those under outward disadvantages. It often occasions quarrels that prove of ill consequence, as it did here. No contentions are so bitter as those between brethren or rivals for honour. What need we have to watch and pray against evil tempers! May the Lord incline all his people to follow after things which make for peace!</body></html>
