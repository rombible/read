And so Isaiah said, "Woe is me! for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). So again the Lord said to Moses, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The name of the well, Beer-lahai-roi, is also thought to mean the well of him that is alive after seeing God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>). And Jacob called the name of the place where he wrestled with the angel Peniel, "for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). See too <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>. The same belief also prevailed amongst the heathen, that seeing a god without his special permission was visited by death or some grave calamity, as Callimachus, quoted by Grotius, says- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The laws of Saturn thus decree,<br />Who dares immortal gods to see<br />Shall suffer loss, whoe'er he be."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:15-23 What Manoah asked for instruction in his duty, he was readily told; but what he asked to gratify his curiosity, was denied. God has in his word given full directions concerning our duty, but never designed to answer other questionings. There are secret things which belong not to us, of which we must be quite contented to be ignorant, while in this world. The name of our Lord is wonderful and secret; but by his wonderful works he makes himself known as far as is needful for us. Prayer is the ascent of the soul to God. But without Christ in the heart by faith, our services are offensive smoke; in him, acceptable flame. We may apply this to Christ's sacrifice of himself for us; he ascended in the flame of his own offering, for by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, Heb 9:12. In Manoah's reflections there is great fear; We shall surely die. In his wife's reflection there is great faith. As a help meet for him, she encouraged him. Let believers who have had communion with God in the word and prayer, to whom he has graciously manifested himself, and who have had reason to think God has accepted their works, take encouragement from thence in a cloudy and dark day. God would not have done what he has done for my soul, if he had designed to forsake me, and leave me to perish at last; for his work is perfect. Learn to reason as Manoah's wife; If God designed me to perish under his wrath, he would not give me tokens of his favour.</body></html>
