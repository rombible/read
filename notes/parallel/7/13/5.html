In the cases of Jephthah and Samson the Israelites learnt the power which rests in individual vows to display the occult and mysterious heroism of the human spirit, and to save people from sinking into the lowest depths (Ewald, 2:397). The vow became a new force of the age. In Jephthah's case it had been an isolated vow, but in Samson's it was the devotion of a life, and developed an indomitable energy and power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The child shall be a Nazarite</span>, etc. So it was said, though not in the same words, concerning Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) and concerning John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>). A Nazarite (or, more correctly, a <span class="accented">Nazi-rite</span>) means one <span class="accented">separated</span>, and specially dedicated to God. The law of the Nazarites is contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, where, however, only <span class="accented">Nazarites of days</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazarites for a definite time, arc spoken cf. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were <span class="accented">perpetual Nazarites</span>, Nazarites of <span class="accented">for ever</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the Mishna classifies them. Abstinence from strong drink, and from anything made of the grape; letting the locks of the head grow unchecked by the razor; and keeping quite clear of any pollution from a dead body, even in case of the death of his nearest relations, were the chief articles of a Nazarite's vow. St. Paul took the vow of a Nazarite of days, and offered the prescribed sacrifices, together with "the hair of the head of his separation," as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall begin</span>, etc. This is an exact description of what Samson did. He did not "deliver Israel" as the other judges did; but he began to shake the Philistine power, and prepared the way for the deliverance of Israel in the time of his worthier successor Samuel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 Israel did evil: then God delivered them again into the hands of the Philistines. When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of such mothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept. Husbands and wives should tell each other their experiences of communion with God, and their improvements in acquaintance with him, that they may help each other in the way that is holy.</body></html>
