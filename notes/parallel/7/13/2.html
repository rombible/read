"Sarai was barren; she had no child" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-30.htm" title="But Sarai was barren; she had no child.">Genesis 11:30</a>). "I am a widow woman, and my husband is dead." It often takes the form of both a positive and negative statement, as "Thou shalt live, and not die."

Enumerated among the cities in the tribe of Dan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>, but ascribed to Judah, <span class="accented">ibid.</span> 15:33 (there transliterated <span class="accented">Zoreah</span>) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>. Probably the boundary passed through the city, as that of Judah and Benjamin did through Jerusalem. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a> it is transliterated <span class="accented">Zareah</span>, and also ascribed to Judah. It is almost always coupled with Eshtaol, as in ver. 25 of this chapter. It was situated in the Shephelah, or plain country, and was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>). It is supposed to be represented by the modern <span class="accented">Surah</span>, at the entrance of the Wady Ghurab. <span class="cmt_word">The family of the Danites</span>. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-42.htm">Numbers 26:42, 43</a> that there was only <span class="accented">one family</span> in the <span class="accented">tribe</span> of Dan, so that in this case tribe and family were co-extensive. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 Israel did evil: then God delivered them again into the hands of the Philistines. When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of such mothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept. Husbands and wives should tell each other their experiences of communion with God, and their improvements in acquaintance with him, that they may help each other in the way that is holy.</body></html>
