Angels invariably discourage and reprove that "worship of angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>), which was the tendency of early Gnostic sects (<span class= "ital">Daniel 10</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him.

And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a>). The angel might have partaken of earthly food, as we see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm" title="And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.">Genesis 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-3.htm" title="And he pressed on them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.">Genesis 19:3</a>.

The angel, perhaps perceiving that Manoah was in doubt as to who he might be, had a holy dread lest he might offer the kid to him, just as the angel whom St. John was about to worship said, "See thou do it not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>); and Barnabas and Paul ran in among the people of Lycaonia to restrain them from offering sacrifice to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14-18</a>). The order of the words, which is rightly given in the A.V., makes it a clear direction to offer the sacrifice to no one but the Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:15-23 What Manoah asked for instruction in his duty, he was readily told; but what he asked to gratify his curiosity, was denied. God has in his word given full directions concerning our duty, but never designed to answer other questionings. There are secret things which belong not to us, of which we must be quite contented to be ignorant, while in this world. The name of our Lord is wonderful and secret; but by his wonderful works he makes himself known as far as is needful for us. Prayer is the ascent of the soul to God. But without Christ in the heart by faith, our services are offensive smoke; in him, acceptable flame. We may apply this to Christ's sacrifice of himself for us; he ascended in the flame of his own offering, for by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, Heb 9:12. In Manoah's reflections there is great fear; We shall surely die. In his wife's reflection there is great faith. As a help meet for him, she encouraged him. Let believers who have had communion with God in the word and prayer, to whom he has graciously manifested himself, and who have had reason to think God has accepted their works, take encouragement from thence in a cloudy and dark day. God would not have done what he has done for my soul, if he had designed to forsake me, and leave me to perish at last; for his work is perfect. Learn to reason as Manoah's wife; If God designed me to perish under his wrath, he would not give me tokens of his favour.</body></html>
