Possibly the true reading is <span class="accented">word</span>, as in the Septuagint. If the text is correct, <span class="accented">words</span> must be taken collectively, as making one promise. The saying marks Manoah's earnest desire for a son. Some, however, construe it, <span class="accented">If thy words come. <span class="cmt_word"></span>How shall we order</span>, etc. - literally, <span class="accented">What will be the manner of the child</span>, and what will be his doing? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, <span class="accented">What will be his manner</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>, and following verses), <span class="accented">and what will be his action or work?</span> or, <span class="accented">What will be his proper treatment</span>, <span class="accented">and what shall be done to him?</span> The former is the most natural rendering of the words, and though the latter seems at first more suitable to the angel's reply, yet if we take the angel's reply as referring Manoah to what he had said before in vers. 4 and 5, we have a distinct answer to the questions. His manner will be to live as a Nazarite, and his action or work will be to begin to deliver israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, where both the <span class="accented">manner</span> and the actione of Ishmael are foretold). In fact, Manoah's question refers directly to vers. 4 and 5, and is a request to have a confirmation of what was then said; just as David asked again and again, <span class="accented">What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26, 30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:8-14 Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet, as Manoah, have believed. Good men are more careful and desirous to know the duty to be done by them, than to know the events concerning them: duty is ours, events are God's. God will guide those by his counsel, who desire to know their duty, and apply to him to teach them. Pious parents, especially, will beg Divine assistance. The angel repeats the directions he had before given. There is need of much care for the right ordering both of ourselves and our children, that we may be duly separate from the world, and living sacrifices to the Lord.</body></html>
