St. Jerome, rendering it "strength of the sun," derives it from <span class= "ital">shemesh, "</span>sun," and <span class= "ital">on, "</span>strength." It is more probable that it means "sunny." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:">Ezra 4:8</a> we have the name Shimshai, perhaps from the same root. The connection of "the sun" with strength was very natural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.">Judges 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/19-5.htm" title="Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.">Psalm 19:5-6</a>). The Rabbis say that he was "named after the name of God, who is called sun and shield of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-12.htm" title="O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in you.">Psalm 84:12</a>). The mother gave the name in this instance. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/29-32.htm" title="And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.">Genesis 29:32-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.">Genesis 35:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-60.htm" title="And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.">Luke 1:60</a>.) Ewald refers it to an Egyptian root, and makes it mean "servant of God," in reference to his being a Nazarite.<p><span class= "bld">The child grew, and the Lord blessed him.</span>--God has many different kinds of blessings, and those here alluded to appear to be the gifts of health, strength, courage, &c. These blessings by no means place Samson on a level with Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/2-21.htm" title="And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.">1Samuel 2:21-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm" title="And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.">1Samuel 3:19</a>) or John the Baptist (Luke 2:80).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Called his name Samson</span>. No doubt the name was significant of what the child should be (see note to ver. 17), but the etymology and meaning of the name are doubtful. Josephus ('Antiq.,' V. 8:4) says the name means "a strong one," but he does not say in what language, and it does not appear to have such a meaning in any Semitic dialect. It is commonly interpreted to mean <span class="accented">like the sun</span>, from <span class="accented">shemesh</span>, the common word for the sun; and so Jerome in his 'Onomasticon' expounds it as <span class="accented">the sun's strength</span>,' possibly with an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>. Others make it equal <span class="accented">shim-</span>shorn, from the Pilpel conjugation of <span class="accented">shamem</span>, <span class="accented">to devastate.</span> Another possible derivation is from the Chaldee <span class="accented">shemash</span>, <span class="accented">to minister</span>, specially in sacred things, a root from which the Nestorian, Syriac, and Arabic names for a deacon are derived. If this were the derivation, it would be a reference to his dedication to God as a Nazarite from his mother's womb, the only thing his mother knew about him when she gave him the name. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:24,25 The Spirit of the Lord began to move Samson when a youth. This was evidence that the Lord blessed him. Where God gives his blessing, he gives his Spirit to qualify for the blessing. Those are blessed indeed in whom the Spirit of grace begins to work in the days of their childhood. Samson drank no wine or strong drink, yet excelled in strength and courage, for he had the Spirit of God moving him; therefore be not drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit.</body></html>
