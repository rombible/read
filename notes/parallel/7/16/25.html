They would not have acted so imprudently as to bring Samson out of his prison had not their judgment been clouded with drink. <span class="cmt_word">That he may make us sport. And he made them sport</span>. The two verbs are not the same in Hebrew, but they have much the same meaning. It is not certain whether the idea conveyed is that of the A.V., that Samson was brought there to be as it were baited by the populace, jeered and jested at, reviled and reproached, perhaps struck or pelted; or whether the words do not simply mean to <span class="accented">dance with music</span>, which is certainly the meaning of the latter verb (he made sport before them, A.V. and margin) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a> (<span class="accented">played</span>, A.V.; see ver. 6); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They set him between the pillars</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he had done dancing; because he must have been dancing outside the house for the people on the roof to see him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:25-31 Nothing fills up the sins of any person or people faster than mocking and misusing the servants of God, even thought it is by their own folly that they are brought low. God put it into Samson's heart, as a public person, thus to avenge on them God's quarrel, Israel's, and his own. That strength which he had lost by sin, he recovers by prayer. That it was not from passion or personal revenge, but from holy zeal for the glory of God and Israel, appears from God's accepting and answering the prayer. The house was pulled down, not by the natural strength of Samson, but by the almighty power of God. In his case it was right he should avenge the cause of God and Israel. Nor is he to be accused of self-murder. He sought not his own death, but Israel's deliverance, and the destruction of their enemies. Thus Samson died in bonds, and among the Philistines, as an awful rebuke for his sins; but he died repentant. The effects of his death typified those of the death of Christ, who, of his own will, laid down his life among transgressors, and thus overturned the foundation of Satan's kingdom, and provided for the deliverance of his people. Great as was the sin of Samson, and justly as he deserved the judgments he brought upon himself, he found mercy of the Lord at last; and every penitent shall obtain mercy, who flees for refuge to that Saviour whose blood cleanses from all sin. But here is nothing to encourage any to indulge sin, from a hope they shall at last repent and be saved.</body></html>
