And she said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he broke the thongs, as a thread of wick is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.">Judges 16:9</a>). "Laying down his head amongst the strumpet flatteries . . . while he sleeps and thinks no harm, they, wickedly shaving off all those bright and weighty tresses . . . which were his ornament and his strength, deliver him over . . ." (Milton, <span class= "ital">Reason of Church Government</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Whether the pagan legends of the lock of Nisus or Pterolaus were distant echoes of this incident we cannot say. But the hair of Samson was no magical amulet. It was only a sign of dedication to God.

We cannot tell the exact meaning of the clause, since it is only in the next verse that Samson is said to awake. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-26.htm" title="For she has cast down many wounded: yes, many strong men have been slain by her.">Proverbs 7:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She called for a man</span>.

In the Hebrew it is <span class="accented">she shaved</span>, but it probably means that she did so by his instrumentality. <span class="cmt_word">She began to afflict</span>, or humble, him. His strength began to wane immediately his locks began to be shorn, and it was all gone by the time his hair was all cut off. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:18-21 See the fatal effects of false security. Satan ruins men by flattering them into a good opinion of their own safety, and so bringing them to mind nothing, and fear nothing; and then he robs them of their strength and honour, and leads them captive at his will. When we sleep our spiritual enemies do not. Samson's eyes were the inlets of his sin, (ver. 1,) and now his punishment began there. Now the Philistines blinded him, he had time to remember how his own lust had before blinded him. The best way to preserve the eyes, is, to turn them away from beholding vanity. Take warning by his fall, carefully to watch against all fleshly lusts; for all our glory is gone, and our defence departed from us, when our separation to God, as spiritual Nazarites, is profaned.</body></html>
