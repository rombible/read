How widely the worship was spread we see from the commonness of the name Beth-dagon in the Shephelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-41.htm" title="And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:41</a>). His chief temple at Azotus was burned by Judas Maccabeus (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-83.htm" title="The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, for safety.">1 Maccabees 10:83</a>). The only other Philistine god mentioned in Scripture is Baal-zebub, god of Ekron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2Kings 1:2-16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gathered them</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> themselves. <span class="cmt_word">To rejoice</span>. The Hebrew <span class="accented">is for a festivity</span>, or <span class="accented">merry-making</span>, or <span class="accented">feast.</span> There was to be a great feast upon the sacrifices offered to Dagon their God. <span class="cmt_word">Dagon</span> (from dag, a fish in Hebrew), the national male god of the Philistines, as <span class="accented">Atergatis</span>, or <span class="accented">Derceto</span>, was their goddess. Both the male and female divinities seem to have had the head and breast and hands human, and the rest of the body fish-shaped (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>). The fish was a natural emblem of fertility and productiveness, especially to a maritime people. The fish-shaped idol is found upon old Phoenician coins, and also on the monuments of Khorsabad, and on some Assyrian gems in the British Museum. One of the chief temples of Dagon was at Gaza. Several towns bore the name of Dagon, as <span class="accented">Beth-dagon</span> in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>) and in Asher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), <span class="accented">Caphar-dagon</span> near Diospolis, etc., showing that the worship of Dagon was widespread. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:22-24 Samson's afflictions were the means of bringing him to deep repentance. By the loss of his bodily sight the eyes of his understanding were opened; and by depriving him of bodily strength, the Lord was pleased to renew his spiritual strength. The Lord permits some few to wander wide and sink deep, yet he recovers them at last, and marking his displeasure at sin in their severe temporal sufferings, preserves them from sinking into the pit of destruction. Hypocrites may abuse these examples, and infidels mock at them, but true Christians will thereby be rendered more humble, watchful, and circumspect; more simple in their dependence on the Lord, more fervent in prayer to be kept from falling, and in praise for being preserved; and, if they fall, they will be kept from sinking into despair.</body></html>
