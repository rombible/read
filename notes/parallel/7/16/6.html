The general lesson is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/4-26.htm" title="Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and become servants for their sakes.">1 Esdras 4:26</a> : "Many have gone out of their wits for women, and have become slaves on account of them; many have perished and erred and sinned by reason of women." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-26.htm" title="For she has cast down many wounded: yes, many strong men have been slain by her.">Proverbs 7:26</a>.) Eastern legends constantly show how women have deceived even prophets. But there was no reason why the sacred historian should linger over the details of scenes so unworthy. If Delilah spoke thus plainly at once, we can only imagine that she was professing to treat the whole matter as a jest. Josephus says: "When Samson was drinking, or at other moments, expressing admiration of his deeds, she kept scheming how to ascertain in what way he was so pre-eminent in valour." An illustration may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/4-29.htm" title="Yet did I see him and Apame the king's concubine, the daughter of the admirable Bartacus, sitting at the right hand of the king,">1 Esdras 4:29</a> : "I saw Apame taking the crown from the king's head and setting it on her own head; she also struck the king with her left hand, and yet for all that the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth. If she laughed upon him, he laughed; if she took displeasure at him, he flattered her, that she may be reconciled to him." The genius of a great poet has depicted such wiles in the idyll of Merlin and Vivi-enne, and it is only by supposing that such wiles were put forth in this instance that we can retain credit for even the most ordinary sense on the part of the Danite hero. But his fault was not stupidity--it was sensual infatuation; and in the ruin and shame which this sensual weakness brought upon him, and the way in which, step by step, it led him to forfeit the great gift of God, lies the chief moral of the story. We find the same lesson in the legend of Hercules and Omphale; and even if this legend was not influenced by the story of Samson's life, yet there is a general analogy between the character of the Greek and the Jewish hero. Samson was no Solomon, and yet the heart of even Solomon--<p>". . . . though large,<p>Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:4-17 Samson had been more than once brought into mischief and danger by the love of women, yet he would not take warning, but is again taken in the same snare, and this third time is fatal. Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls. The anguish of the suffering is ten thousand times greater than all the pleasures of the sin.</body></html>
