Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's Hebrew 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Men lying in wait.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and the spy sat in the room for her, i.e., </span>to help her. It is doubtful whether there was more than one spy, who could be easily concealed. It is implied that she bound Samson while he slept, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-19.htm" title="And she made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.">Judges 16:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">When it toucheth the fire.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">when it smelleth the fire. </span>(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-14.htm" title="And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and the cords that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.">Judges 15:14</a>.) So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-9.htm" title="Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.">Job 14:9</a> : "through the <span class= "ital">scent </span>of water it will bud." Of course the writer leaves us to infer that the spy or spies did not appear, seeing that the plan had failed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were men lying in wait</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and the liers in wait were abiding for her in the chamber.</span> She had hid some three or four men in the chamber unknown to Samson, that they might be ready to fall upon him should his strength really have departed from him. The word for <span class="accented">liers in wait</span> is in the singular number, but is to be taken collectively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-33.htm">Judges 20:33, 36-38</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-37.htm">Judges 20:37</a> it is joined to a plural verb. It is to be presumed that through some concerted signal the liers in wait did not discover themselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:4-17 Samson had been more than once brought into mischief and danger by the love of women, yet he would not take warning, but is again taken in the same snare, and this third time is fatal. Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls. The anguish of the suffering is ten thousand times greater than all the pleasures of the sin.</body></html>
