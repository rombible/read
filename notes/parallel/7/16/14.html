The loom was doubtless one of a simple kind in ordinary domestic use (like that described in <span class= "ital">Livingstone's Travels</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and Samson, startled from sleep, tore away his locks with the plug which fastened them down and the warp into which they were woven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she fastened it with the pin</span>. The Septuagint and many commentators understand that she used the pin (it is the common word for a tent pin) to fasten the loom or frame to the ground, or to the wall. But a good sense comes out if we understand the phrase to mean, <span class="accented">So she struck with the shuttle</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she did what Samson told her to do, viz., wove his locks into the warp which was already prepared. This was done by successive strokes of the shuttle, to which the hair was fastened. <span class="accented">To strike with the peg or shuttle</span> may have been the technical phrase for throwing the shuttle with the woof into the warp; and it is a strong argument in favour of this interpretation that it makes her action the simple fulfilment of his directions. He said, "Weave my locks into the warp. So she struck with the shuttle." <span class="cmt_word">With the pin of the beam, and with the web</span>. The Hebrew word '<span class="accented">ereg</span> cannot mean <span class="accented">the beam</span>, as it is here translated; it is the substantive of the verb <span class="accented">to weave</span> in ver. 13. Its obvious meaning, therefore, is <span class="accented">the woof.</span> The pin of the woof, therefore, is the shuttle with the woof attached to it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Samson's hair, which was firmly woven into the <span class="accented">warp.</span> He went away with. This is the same word as was applied in ver. 3 to his <span class="accented">plucking up</span> the gateposts. Now, with the strength of his neck, he tore up the shuttle which fastened his hair to the warp, and so dragged the whole solid frame along with it.
