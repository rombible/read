The word for "locks"--<span class= "ital">machelephoth</span>--occurs here only. The LXX. render it "curls<span class= "ital">" </span>(<span class= "ital">bostruchous</span>) and <span class= "ital">seiras, </span>which appears to mean "plaits," like the Greek <span class= "ital">plokamous. </span>The word for "web" is a technical word, and perhaps means warp. The LXX. and the Vulg. add, "and drive them with the peg into the wall," which is implied in the next verse. With almost incredible levity and folly, Samson here goes to the very verge of the true secret, and suffers his sacred hair to be woven in a harlot's loom.

Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls. The anguish of the suffering is ten thousand times greater than all the pleasures of the sin.</body></html>
