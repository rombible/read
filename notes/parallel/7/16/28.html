O God.</span>--Three names of God--Adonai, Jehovah, Elohim.<p><span class= "bld">That I may be at once avenged of the Philistines.</span>--Again we see that Samson stood at a comparatively low level of spiritual enlightenment as well as of moral purity. One cannot help feeling that Milton has read into the hero's character an austere grandeur which it did not possess. His Samson of the <span class= "ital">Samson Agonistes </span>is rather Milton himself than the Jewish hero. That stern classic poem is the "thundering reverberation of a mighty spirit, struck by the plectrum of disappointment."<p><span class= "bld">For my two eyes.</span>--The words rendered "at once" in the previous clause may be rendered "that I may avenge myself <span class= "ital">the revenge of one </span>of my two eyes." If so, there seems to be in the words a grim jest, as though no vengeance would suffice for the fearful loss of both his eyes (LXX., "<span class= "ital">one </span>revenge for my <span class= "ital">two </span>eyes"), "one last tremendous deed, one last fearful jest." There is a curious parallel to this achievement of Samson in the story of Cleo-medes of Astypalaea, who in revenge for a fine pulls down a pillar, and crushes the boys in a school (Pausan. <span class= "ital">Perieg. </span>Vi. 2, 3). Cassel tells us that on July 21st, 1864, many people were killed by the breaking of a granite pillar in the Church of the Transfiguration at St. Petersburg.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson called unto the Lord</span>. This is the first mention we have of Samson praying since the memorable occasion when he gave the fountain the name of <span class="accented">En-hakkoreh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-19.htm">Judges 15:19</a>, note). Perhaps we may see in this an evidence that his affliction and shame had not been without their effect, in bringing him back to God humbled and penitent. The language is very earnest. "O Lord, Jehovah, remember me strengthen me only this once, O God!" The threefold name by which he addresses the Almighty implies great tension of spirit. <span class="cmt_word">That I may be at once avenged</span>. Meaning <span class="accented">at one stroke</span> - he would take one vengeance so terrible that it would be sufficient for his two eyes, which makes very good sense if the Hebrew will bear it. The literal translation would be, <span class="accented">that I may be avenged with a vengeance of one</span> stroke. Others take it, <span class="accented">that I may be avenged with a vengeance for one of my two eyes</span>, which it is not easy to understand the meaning of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:25-31 Nothing fills up the sins of any person or people faster than mocking and misusing the servants of God, even thought it is by their own folly that they are brought low. God put it into Samson's heart, as a public person, thus to avenge on them God's quarrel, Israel's, and his own. That strength which he had lost by sin, he recovers by prayer. That it was not from passion or personal revenge, but from holy zeal for the glory of God and Israel, appears from God's accepting and answering the prayer. The house was pulled down, not by the natural strength of Samson, but by the almighty power of God. In his case it was right he should avenge the cause of God and Israel. Nor is he to be accused of self-murder. He sought not his own death, but Israel's deliverance, and the destruction of their enemies. Thus Samson died in bonds, and among the Philistines, as an awful rebuke for his sins; but he died repentant. The effects of his death typified those of the death of Christ, who, of his own will, laid down his life among transgressors, and thus overturned the foundation of Satan's kingdom, and provided for the deliverance of his people. Great as was the sin of Samson, and justly as he deserved the judgments he brought upon himself, he found mercy of the Lord at last; and every penitent shall obtain mercy, who flees for refuge to that Saviour whose blood cleanses from all sin. But here is nothing to encourage any to indulge sin, from a hope they shall at last repent and be saved.</body></html>
