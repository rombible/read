This is an argument from undisputed possession.<p><span class= "bld">In Aroer and her towns.</span>--These had been assigned to the tribe of Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In all the cities that be along by the coast of Arnon.</span>--The LXX. read Jordan.<p><span class= "bld">Three hundred years.</span>--There is an almost insuperable difficulty in making out any reasonable scheme of chronology even by accepting this as a round number, because it is difficult to reconcile with nine or ten genealogies which have been preserved to us, and which represent the period between the conquest and David by seven or eight generations. Now the period covered by these genealogies includes the judgeship of Samuel and the reign of Saul--at least seventy years; and seven or eight generations cannot possibly span 370 years. The hypothesis that in <span class= "ital">all </span>these genealogies--even the four times repeated genealogy of David--generations are always omitted is very improbable. The chronology of the Jews is confessedly loose and uncertain, and it seems quite possible that "three hundred years" may be a marginal gloss which has crept into the text. What makes this more probable is that the words not only create an immense chronological difficulty, but (1) are quite needless to Jephthah's argument, and (2) actually conflict with the rest of the sentence, which refers <span class= "ital">to </span>Balak alone; the argument being, If Balak, "<span class= "ital">at </span>that time" (as the words should be rendered), did not advance any claim, what right have you to do so <span class= "ital">now? </span>If, however, in spite of these difficulties, the clause be genuine, and if there has not been one of the clerical errors which are so common where numerals are concerned, it seems possible that 300 years may be counted inclusively, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>100 full years since the death of Joshua and nominal completion of the conquest of Canaan, with parts of a century before and after it. Certainly this is a recognised mode of reckoning time among the Jews. For instance, if a king began to reign on December 30, 1879, and died on January 2, 1881, they would say that he had reigned three years. Whatever explanations we may adopt, there is nothing but conjecture to go upon. (See Introduction.)<p><span class= "bld">Within that time.</span>--This is a mistranslation, due probably to the perplexity caused by the "three hundred years." The Hebrew has "in that time," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>at that crisis. It was obvious, without special mention, that they had remained in possession ever since Balak's day, and in the most ancient times it was admitted that lapse of time secured possession (Isocr. <span class= "ital">Ep. ad Aechid., </span>p. 121; Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. vi.</span> 31).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - The occupation of the cities and villages referred to is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a> and following verses, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Aroer</span> is not mentioned among the cities of Moab taken by the Amorites in the ancient book quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27</a>-80, and it has been conjectured that it may have been built by the Amorites to secure their new frontier. It is described by Eusebius and Jerome in the 'Onomasticon' as built on a hill overhanging the bank of the Amen, and a ruin called Arair has been foBy the coasts of Arnon</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the banks. The Septuagint for <span class="accented">Arnon</span> reads <span class="accented">Jordan</span>, which was the western boundary, as Arnon was the southern (ver. 22). The corresponding description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a> is, <span class="accented">From Aroer</span>, <span class="accented">which is by the brink of the river of Arnon</span>, <span class="accented">and from the city that is by the river</span>, <span class="accented">even unto Gilead</span>:, <span class="accented">there was not owe city too strong for us</span>: <span class="accented">the Lord our God delivered all unto us. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Three hundred years</span>. These words seem quite unintelligible and out of place. They are also chronologically impracticable. One expects the number of the cities, as in ver. 33, rather than the number of years; and it is remarkable that the whole number of cities taken by the Israelites on the east of Jordan must have been just about 300, since the half-tribe of Manasseh had sixty. If Gad and Reuben had the same proportion, it would be exactly 300 (5 &times; 60). <span class="cmt_word">Within that time</span>. The Hebrew phrase, which occurs about seventy times, invariably means <span class="accented">at that time</span>, and here can only refer to the time of the first settlement in the days of Balak, of which he had been speaking - another proof that the enumeration <span class="accented">three hundred years</span> is out of place here. If the reading <span class="accented">years is</span> not, as above suggested, an error for <span class="accented">cities</span>, the whole sentence, <span class="accented">three hundred years</span>, may very probably be an interpolation by a professed chronologist. The adding up of all the numbers of the servitudes and rests given in the book gives 301 years from the commencement of the oppression by Chushan-rishathaim to the death of Jair. But this method of reckoning gives the impossible period of 600 years from the exodus to the building of the temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:12-28 One instance of the honour and respect we owe to God, as our God, is, rightly to employ what he gives us to possess. Receive it from him, use it for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of this message shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books of Moses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable. Those who possess the most courageous faith, will be the most disposed for peace, and the readiest to make advances to obtain; but rapacity and ambition often cloak their designs under a plea of equity, and render peaceful endeavours of no avail.</body></html>
