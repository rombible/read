The word may, however, be used in the harsh sense of the brethren of Jephthah, without being strictly accurate.

But is this Gilead the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, or some later Gilead? or does <span class= "ital">"</span>begat" mean "was the ancestor of?" The answer to these questions depends mainly upon the insoluble problem of the chronology; but we may note (1) that since no <span class= "ital">other </span>Gilead is mentioned, we should naturally infer that <span class= "ital">this </span>is the grandson of Manasseh; and (2) that the fact referred to in the obscure genealogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/7-14.htm" title="The sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bore: (but his concubine the Aramitess bore Machir the father of Gilead:">1Chronicles 7:14-17</a> seems to show that the family of Manasseh had Syrian (Aramean) connections, and Jephthah's mother may have been an Aramitess from the district of Tob. The name Jephthah means "he opens" (the womb).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jephthah the Gileadite</span>. Gilead has two meanings: it is the name of the country so called (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a>, note), and it is the name of the son or descendant of Machir the son of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29, 30</a>). <span class="accented">Gileadite</span> also may be explained in two ways: it may mean an inhabitant of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-18.htm">Judges 10:18</a>), or it may mean a member of the family of the Gileadites, either an actual son or a more remote descendant of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29</a>) - two meanings which would usually coincide. <span class="cmt_word">Gilead begat Jephthah</span>. Here <span class="accented">Gilead</span> must mean the person so called, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the son or descendant of Machir, from whom the family, including Jephthah, were called Gileadites; but whether son or descendant cannot positively be affirmed. All that is certain is that he was that one of Maehir's descendants who was the head of that division of the Manassites who were called <span class="accented">Gileadites.</span> Again, when it is said <span class="accented">Gilead begat Jephthah</span>, we cannot be certain whether it is meant that Gilead was Jephthah's father, or merely his ancestor (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-11 Men ought not to be blamed for their parentage, so long as they by their personal merits roll away any reproach. God had forgiven Israel, therefore Jephthah will forgive. He speaks not with confidence of his success, knowing how justly God might suffer the Ammonites to prevail for the further punishment of Israel. Nor does he speak with any confidence at all in himself. If he succeed, it is the Lord delivers them into his hand; he thereby reminds his countrymen to look up to God as the Giver of victory. The same question as here, in fact, is put to those who desire salvation by Christ. If he save you, will ye be willing that he shall rule you? On no other terms will he save you. If he make you happy, shall he make you holy? If he be your helper, shall he be your Head? Jephthah, to obtain a little worldly honour, was willing to expose his life: shall we be discouraged in our Christian warfare by the difficulties we may meet with, when Christ has promised a crown of life to him that overcometh?</body></html>
