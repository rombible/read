There were two kinds of vows among the Hebrews--the simple vow, <span class= "ital">neder </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.">Leviticus 27:2-27</a>), and the "devotion," or "ban," <span class= "ital">cherem </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28-29</a>). Anything devoted to Jehovah by the <span class= "ital">cherem </span>was irredeemable, and became "a holy of holies<span class= "ital">" </span>(<span class= "ital">kodesh kadashim</span>) to Him, and was to be put to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm" title="None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 27:29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I cannot go back.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-2.htm" title="If a man vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.">Numbers 30:2</a>. Jephthah had not understood until now the horror of human sacrifice. He would neither wish nor dare to draw back from his <span class= "ital">cherem </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm" title="When you vow a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools: pay that which you have vowed.">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-9.htm" title="But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.">Jonah 2:9</a>; Pss. 72:25, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-11.htm" title="But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be merciful to me.">Psalm 26:11</a>) merely because the anguish of it would fall so heavily upon himself. The Hebrews had the most intense feeling about the awfulness of breaking an oath or vow, and they left no room for any mental reservations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28-29</a>). Saul was determined to carry out his ban even at the cost of the life of his eldest son, and even Herod Antipas felt obliged to carry out his oath to Herodias, though it involved a deep pang and a haunted conscience. It is clear that not for one moment did it occur to Jephthah to save himself from the agony of bereavement by breaking his 'ban" (<span class= "ital">cherem</span>) as a mere redeemable vow (<span class= "ital">neder</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The Jews shared in this respect the feelings of other ancient nations. Thus the Greeks believed that the house of Athamas were under an inexpiable curse, because when the Achaeans had been bidden to offer him up for a sacrifice for compassing the death of Phryxus, Kytissorus, the son of Phryxus, had intercepted the sacrifice (Herod. vii. 197, ? 3; Plat. <span class= "ital">Minos, </span>5). It must be remembered that though his <span class= "ital">cherem </span>had taken an unusual and unlawful (though far from unknown) form, the notion of such a vow would come far more naturally to a people which in very recent times, as well as afterwards, had devoted whole cities--men, women, children, cattle, and goods--to absolute destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-2.htm" title="And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.">Numbers 21:2-3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast brought me very low</span> - literally, <span class="accented">thou hast thoroughly bowed me down</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">I cannot go back</span>. A forcible illustration of the evil of rash vows. He who makes them is so placed that he must sin. If he breaks his vow, he has taken God's name in vain; if he keeps it, he breaks one of God's commandments. So it was with Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24, 39-45</a>), with Herod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-23.htm">Mark 6:23</a>); so it has often been since with those who have made unauthorised vows, and who in attempting to keep them have fallen into deadly sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:29-40 Several important lessons are to be learned from Jephthah's vow. 1. There may be remainders of distrust and doubting, even in the hearts of true and great believers. 2. Our vows to God should not be as a purchase of the favour we desire, but to express gratitude to him. 3. We need to be very well-advised in making vows, lest we entangle ourselves. 4. What we have solemnly vowed to God, we must perform, if it be possible and lawful, though it be difficult and grievous to us. 5. It well becomes children, obediently and cheerfully to submit to their parents in the Lord. It is hard to say what Jephthah did in performance of his vow; but it is thought that he did not offer his daughter as a burnt-offering. Such a sacrifice would have been an abomination to the Lord; it is supposed she was obliged to remain unmarried, and apart from her family. Concerning this and some other such passages in the sacred history, about which learned men are divided and in doubt, we need not perplex ourselves; what is necessary to our salvation, thanks be to God, is plain enough. If the reader recollects the promise of Christ concerning the teaching of the Holy Spirit, and places himself under this heavenly Teacher, the Holy Ghost will guide to all truth in every passage, so far as it is needful to be understood.</body></html>
