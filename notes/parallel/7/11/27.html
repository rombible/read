(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-5.htm" title="And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be on you: I have given my maid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and you.">Genesis 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-53.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.">Genesis 31:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm" title="The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.">1Samuel 24:15</a>.)<p>These verses contain a deeply interesting specimen of what may be called ancient diplomacy, and very powerful and straightforward it is--at once honest, conciliatory, and firm. Jephthah maintains the rights of Israel on three grounds, viz., (1) Right of direct conquest, not from Ammon but from the Amorites (15-20); (2) The decision of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/11-21.htm" title="And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.">Judges 11:21-23</a>), which he supports by an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem</span>--namely, the acquiescence in this decision of the Moabite god Chemosh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.">Judges 11:24</a>); (3) Undisputed possession from the first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/11-25.htm" title="And now are you any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,">Judges 11:25-26</a>).

Receive it from him, use it for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of this message shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books of Moses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable. Those who possess the most courageous faith, will be the most disposed for peace, and the readiest to make advances to obtain; but rapacity and ambition often cloak their designs under a plea of equity, and render peaceful endeavours of no avail.</body></html>
