There are, indeed, no limits to the possible irregularities of these disturbed times, during which the priests seem to have sunk into the completest insignificance. The Ark may therefore have been transferred for a time to Mizpeh, in Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.">Judges 20:1</a>), as tradition says. But if that Mizpeh had been meant, it would certainly have been specified, since the Mizpeh of our present narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm" title="Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.">Judges 10:17</a>) is in Gilead. Nor is it at all likely that the High Priest would have carried the sacred Urim into the disturbed and threatened Eastern districts. "Before Jehovah" probably means nothing more than by some solemn religious utterance or ceremony; and Mizpeh in Gilead had its own sacred associations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/31-48.htm" title="And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;">Genesis 31:48-49</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Head and captain</span>. Both civil ruler or judge, and military chief. <span class="cmt_word">Uttered all his words before the Lord</span>. The expression "before the Lord" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-34.htm">Exodus 34:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-2.htm">Judges 21:2</a> (<span class="accented">before God</span>), and elsewhere, to signify the special presence of the Lord which was to be found in the tabernacle, or with the ark, or where there was the priest with an ephod. And this must be the meaning of the expression here. Jephthah was installed at the national place of gathering and consultation for Gilead, viz., at Mizpah in Gilead, into his office as bead of the State, and there, as in the capital, he performed all his duties under the sanctions of religion. Whether, however, the ark was brought there, or the altar, or a priest with an ephod, or whether some substitute was devised which the unsettled times might justify, it is impossible to say from want of information. There seems to be some reference in the words to Jephthah's vow, in ver. 31, as one of such utterances. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-11 Men ought not to be blamed for their parentage, so long as they by their personal merits roll away any reproach. God had forgiven Israel, therefore Jephthah will forgive. He speaks not with confidence of his success, knowing how justly God might suffer the Ammonites to prevail for the further punishment of Israel. Nor does he speak with any confidence at all in himself. If he succeed, it is the Lord delivers them into his hand; he thereby reminds his countrymen to look up to God as the Giver of victory. The same question as here, in fact, is put to those who desire salvation by Christ. If he save you, will ye be willing that he shall rule you? On no other terms will he save you. If he make you happy, shall he make you holy? If he be your helper, shall he be your Head? Jephthah, to obtain a little worldly honour, was willing to expose his life: shall we be discouraged in our Christian warfare by the difficulties we may meet with, when Christ has promised a crown of life to him that overcometh?</body></html>
