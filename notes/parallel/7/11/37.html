For the phrase "let me alone," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm" title="Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-3.htm" title="And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers to all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to you.">1Samuel 11:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And bewail my virginity.</span>--The thought which was so grievous to the Hebrew maiden was not death, but to die unwedded and childless. This is the bitterest wail of Antigone also, in the great play of Sophocles (<span class= "ital">Ant. </span>890); but to a Hebrew maid the pang would be more bitter, because the absence of motherhood cut off from her, and, in this instance, from her house, the hopes which prophecy had cherished. Josephus makes the expression mean no more than "to bewail <span class= "ital">her youth," neoteta </span>(Jos. <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 7, ? 10).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And bewail my virginity</span>. It is a striking evidence of the strong desire among Hebrew women to be mothers, as seen in Sarah, Rachel, Hannah, and others, that it was the prospect of dying unmarried which seemed to Jephthah's daughter the saddest part of her fate. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-63.htm">Psalm 78:63</a>, <span class="accented">their maidens were not given to marriage</span> is one of the items of the misery of Israel (see too ver. 39). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:29-40 Several important lessons are to be learned from Jephthah's vow. 1. There may be remainders of distrust and doubting, even in the hearts of true and great believers. 2. Our vows to God should not be as a purchase of the favour we desire, but to express gratitude to him. 3. We need to be very well-advised in making vows, lest we entangle ourselves. 4. What we have solemnly vowed to God, we must perform, if it be possible and lawful, though it be difficult and grievous to us. 5. It well becomes children, obediently and cheerfully to submit to their parents in the Lord. It is hard to say what Jephthah did in performance of his vow; but it is thought that he did not offer his daughter as a burnt-offering. Such a sacrifice would have been an abomination to the Lord; it is supposed she was obliged to remain unmarried, and apart from her family. Concerning this and some other such passages in the sacred history, about which learned men are divided and in doubt, we need not perplex ourselves; what is necessary to our salvation, thanks be to God, is plain enough. If the reader recollects the promise of Christ concerning the teaching of the Holy Spirit, and places himself under this heavenly Teacher, the Holy Ghost will guide to all truth in every passage, so far as it is needful to be understood.</body></html>
