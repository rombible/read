Of course, "did with her according to his vow" can only mean <span class= "ital">"</span>offered her up for a burnt offering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-31.htm" title="Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.">Judges 11:31</a>). "Some," says Luther, "affirm that he did not sacrifice her; but the text is clear enough." The attempt, first started by Rabbi Kimchi, to make this mean "kept her unmarried until death"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>shut her up in a sacred celibacy--is a mere sophistication of plain Scripture. That he did actually slay her in accordance with his <span class= "ital">cherem </span>is clear, not only from the plain words, but also for the following reasons:--(1) The customs of that day knew nothing about treating women as <span class= "ital">"</span>nuns." If there had been any institution of vestals among the Jews we should without fail have heard of it, nor would the fate of Jephthah's daughter been here regarded and represented as exceptionally tragic. (2) There are decisive Scriptural analogies to Jephthah's vow, taken in its most literal sense--Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-3.htm" title="And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,">Genesis 23:3</a>), Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm" title="And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.">1Samuel 14:44</a>), &c. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-31.htm" title="Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.">Judges 11:31</a>.) (3) There are decisive Pagan analogies, both Oriental (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.">2Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a>) and classical. Thus Idomeneus actually sacrificed his eldest son (Serv. <span class= "ital">ad 'n. </span>iii. 331) in an exactly similar vow, and Agamemnon his daughter Iphigenia. (4) The ancient Jews, who were far better acquainted than we can be with the thoughts and customs of their race and the meaning of their own language, have always understood that Jephthah did literally offer his daughter as "a burnt offering." The Targum of Jonathan adds to the words "it was a custom in Israel" the explanation, "in order that no one should make his son or his daughter a burnt offering, as Jephthah did, and did not consult Phinehas the priest. Had he done so, he would have redeemed her with money"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Phinehas would have decided that it was <span class= "ital">less </span>crime to redeem such a <span class= "ital">cherem </span>than to offer a human sacrifice. It is curious to find that another legend (<span class= "ital">hagadah</span>) connects Phinehas with this event in a very different way. It says that Phinehas sanctioned, and even performed the sacrifice, and that for this very reason he was superseded by the indignation of the Israelites, which is the reason they offer for the fact that Eli was of the house, <span class= "ital">not </span>of Phmehas, but of Ithamar (Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Works, </span>i. 12-18). In the same way Idomeneus, after sacrificing his eldest son, is punished by the gods with plague and by his citizens with banishment. Josephus agrees with these Jewish authorities, and says that Jephthah offered (<span class= "ital">holokautosen</span>) his daughter (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-31.htm" title="Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.">Judges 11:31</a>); and so does Rabbi Tanchum. The opinion was undisputed till a thousand years after Christ, when Rabbi Kimchi invented the plausible hypothesis which has pleased so many commentators who carry their own notions to the Bible ready made, and then find them there. Ewald contents himself with saying that this "timid modern notion needs no refutation." It is remarkable that we find a similar vow as late as the sixth century after Christ. Abd Almuttalib, grandfather of Mohammed, vows to kill his son Abd Allah if God will give him ten sons. He had twelve sons; but when he wishes to perform his vow the Koreish interfere, and Abd Almuttalib, at the bidding of a priestess, gives one hundred camels as a ransom (Weil, <span class= "ital">Mohammed, </span>p. 8).<p><span class= "bld">It was a custom.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">ordinance</span>--namely, to lament Jephthah's daughter. Probably the custom was local only, for we find no other allusion to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who did with her according to his vow</span>. Nothing can be more express than this statement. In fact, except the natural horror we feel at a human sacrifice, there is nothing to cast the least shade of doubt upon the fact that Jephthah's daughter was offered up as a burnt offering, in accordance with heathen notions, but, as Josephus says, neither "conformably to the law, nor acceptably to God." Most of the early Jewish commentators and all the Christian Fathers for ten or eleven centuries (Origen, Chrysostom, Theo-doret, Jerome, Augustine, etc.) held this view. Luther's comment is, "Some affirm that he did not sacrifice her, but the text is clear enough." <span class="cmt_word">She knew</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">she had known</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:29-40 Several important lessons are to be learned from Jephthah's vow. 1. There may be remainders of distrust and doubting, even in the hearts of true and great believers. 2. Our vows to God should not be as a purchase of the favour we desire, but to express gratitude to him. 3. We need to be very well-advised in making vows, lest we entangle ourselves. 4. What we have solemnly vowed to God, we must perform, if it be possible and lawful, though it be difficult and grievous to us. 5. It well becomes children, obediently and cheerfully to submit to their parents in the Lord. It is hard to say what Jephthah did in performance of his vow; but it is thought that he did not offer his daughter as a burnt-offering. Such a sacrifice would have been an abomination to the Lord; it is supposed she was obliged to remain unmarried, and apart from her family. Concerning this and some other such passages in the sacred history, about which learned men are divided and in doubt, we need not perplex ourselves; what is necessary to our salvation, thanks be to God, is plain enough. If the reader recollects the promise of Christ concerning the teaching of the Holy Spirit, and places himself under this heavenly Teacher, the Holy Ghost will guide to all truth in every passage, so far as it is needful to be understood.</body></html>
