And Jacob said, You shall not give me any thing: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.">Genesis 30:31</a>). The expression seems to be intended to show scorn for Micah; and perhaps it is from missing this element that the LXX. soften it down into "my graven image," and the Chaldee to "my fear." "My gods which I made" would be a very ordinary expression for the Greeks, who called a sculptor a "god-maker" (<span class= "ital">theopoios</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but was startling on the lips of an Israelite. Micah pathetically asks "What have I more?" but we may well hope that his present loss was his ultimate gain, and that he found the true God in place of the lost gods which he had made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My gods</span>, or, as some render it, <span class="accented">my god.</span> But the plural is probably right, as Micah was thinking of the molten and graven images, and the teraphim, and called them <span class="accented">gods</span>, without perhaps meaning to imply that there was any God but Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
