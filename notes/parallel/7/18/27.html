Probably the notion that such conduct was cruel and unjustifiable never occurred to them; nor must we judge them by the standard of Christian times. But Dan was no gainer. His name disappears from the records of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-1.htm" title="The sons of Judah; Pharez, Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur, and Shobal.">1Chronicles 4:1</a>, and he is not mentioned among the elected tribes in Revelation 7. Blunt (<span class= "ital">Undesigned Coincidences, </span>pt. 2, 4) conjectures, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm" title="The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with your cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David your father.">2Chronicles 2:14</a>, that the cause of their disappearance from Israelite records--the latest mention of them as a tribe being in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-22.htm" title="Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.">1Chronicles 27:22</a>--was due to their intermarriages with the Ph?nicians.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they</span>. In the Hebrew the <span class="accented">they is</span> emphatic. It would be better expressed in English by repeating <span class="accented">The children of Dan.</span> The repetition of the epithets <span class="accented">quiet and secure</span>, as applied to the people of Laish, rather seems to indicate the writer's reprobation of the deed as cruel, like that of Simeon and Levi in slaying Hamor and Shechem. <span class="cmt_word">They smote them with the edge of the sword</span> - a phrase denoting an exterminating slaughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And they burnt the city</span>, etc. Perhaps they had made the people and city a <span class="accented">cherem</span>, a devoted thing, and therefore slew the one and burnt the other (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-19.htm">Joshua 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11</a>, etc.); or the burning of the city may have been one of the means by which they destroyed the people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
