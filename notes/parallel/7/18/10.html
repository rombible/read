This well describes the position of Tel el-Kadi. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm" title="Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.">Judges 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm" title="And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelled therein.">Judges 18:28</a>.)<p>God hath given it into your hands.--Of this they feel confident, from the interpretation which they put upon the oracular response given them by Jonathan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-6.htm" title="And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein you go.">Judges 18:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Translate, "When ye come, ye shall come unto a people secure; and the land is very large (for God hath given it into your hands), a place where there is no want," etc. The Hebrew of <span class="accented">very. large</span> is, literally, <span class="accented">wide on both hands.</span> The parenthetic <span class="accented">for God hath given it into your</span> hands, merely explains why they speak so confidently about it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
