The word is <span class= "ital">hakkebodah, </span>which the LXX. (Cod. A) render "their glorious possession," and the Vulg. "everything which was precious," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the valuables. But as <span class= "ital">cabid </span>means "to be heavy," the rendering of the Vatican MS. of the LXX.--"the weight," i.e., "the heavy baggage" (<span class= "ital">impedimenta</span>)--may be right. The word has no connection with that similarly rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-22.htm" title="And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.">1Samuel 17:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Before them.</span>--Because they expected pursuit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They turned</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> turned their backs upon Beth-Micah, and went on their way to the north. <span class="cmt_word">The little ones</span>.
