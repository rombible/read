The beauty of the site well bears out the description--"the rich and beautiful seclusion of that loveliest of the scenes of Palestine" (Stanley). It was by a similar statement that Anaxilaus of Rhegium persuaded the Messenians to seize Zankle (Pausan. 4:23, quoted by Cassel).<p><span class= "bld">Are ye still?</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?">1Kings 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-9.htm" title="Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come on us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.">2Kings 7:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To go, and to enter</span>. The exact meaning is, Be not slothful to go (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to go on your way from hence), so as to enter in and possess the land. This would be expressed by leaving out <span class="accented">to</span> before <span class="accented">enter - to go</span> and enter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.
