In any case, it would make the inhabitants more ready to accept a cherubic symbol of Jehovah; for we may fairly assume that the "image" was not dissociated from the worship of God, whether as Elohim or Jehovah. Jonathan and the Danites both acknowledged Him under the name Elohim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm" title="And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.">Judges 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-10.htm" title="When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.">Judges 18:10</a>), and Micah, in spite of his images, acknowledged God as Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm" title="And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my son.">Judges 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-13.htm" title="Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.">Judges 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-6.htm" title="And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein you go.">Judges 18:6</a>), to whom, indeed, the very name of Jonathan ("gift of Jehovah") bore witness. Whether this, or rather the smallness of Dan, is the reason for its exclusion from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a> must remain uncertain. The Fathers thought, for this reason, that Antichrist would spring from the tribe of Dan.<p><span class= "bld">Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh.</span>--The extreme reluctance to admit this fact--the disgrace involved against the memory of Moses by this rapid and total degeneracy of his grandson--is probably the reason why up to this point in the narrative the name has been withheld. There can, however, be no doubt that Jonathan was the young Levite who has all along been spoken of. The reading of MANASSEH for MOSES is by the confession of the Jews themselves due to the same cause. Moses is in Hebrew <span class= "greekheb">??????</span>?, Manasseh is <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span>. It will thus be seen that (without the points) the names only differ by the letter n (<span class= "greekheb"></span>). But in what is called the Masoretic text--i.e., the text edited by the Jewish scribes--the <span class= "greekheb"></span> is not boldly inserted, but is timidly and furtively suspended--thus MSSH--and is called <span class= "ital">nun tha?-yah </span>(<span class= "ital">n </span>suspended). This was done to conceal from the uninitiated the painful fact. It was known to St. Jerome, and accordingly the Vulg. reads "son of Moses," which is also found in some MSS. of the LXX. Theodoret has "son of Manasseh, son of Gershom, son of Moses." The Jews distinguish between the "text" (<span class= "ital">Kethib "</span>written") and the margin (<span class= "ital">Keri </span>"read"), and Rabbi Tanchum admits that here "Moses" is <span class= "ital">written, </span>though "Manasseh" is <span class= "ital">read. </span>The Talmud says that he was grandson of Moses; but "because he did the deeds of Manasseh" (the idolatrous king, 2 Kings 21), "the Scripture assigns him to the family of Manasseh" (<span class= "ital">Babha Bathra, </span>f. 109, 2); and on this a later Rabbi remarks that "the prophet"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the sacred author--"studiously avoided calling Gershom the son of Moses, <span class= "ital">because it would have been ignominious to Moses to have had an ungodly son; </span>but he calls him the son of Manasseh, suspending the <span class= "ital">n </span>above the line to show that he was <span class= "ital">the son of Manasseh </span>(in a metaphorical sense) by imitating his impiety, though a son of Moses by <span class= "ital">descent." </span>The Talmudists account for the distasteful tact by saying that the degeneracy was due to the <span class= "ital">wife</span><p>of Moses, who was a Midianite, so that there was a taint in the blood of the family. It is not, however, the sacred author who is guilty of this "pious fraud," but the Masoretic editors. The rarity of the name Gershom (which means "a stranger there," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm" title="And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.">Exodus 2:22</a>) would alone be sufficient to betray the secret. The extravagant and superstitious letter-worship of the scribes did not suffice to prevent them from tampering with the <span class= "ital">letter, </span>any more than it prevented the Rabbis from entirely explaining away the obvious <span class= "ital">spirit </span>of the Law which they professed to adore. The only uncertainty in the matter is whether this wandering Levite, this young Jonathan who for less than thirty shillings a year becomes the priest of an idolatrous worship, was the actual <span class= "ital">grandson, </span>or only a later descendant of Moses, since the Jews often omit steps in their genealogies. There is, however, no reason why he should not have been the actual grandson, since he is contemporary with Phinehas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm" title="And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.">Judges 20:28</a>), who was, without any question, the actual grandson of Aaron. This rapid degeneracy may perhaps account for the obscuration of the family of Moses, which never seems to have subsequently risen into any importance, and of which no more names are preserved. Jonathan's name is excluded, perhaps deliberately, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/23-15.htm" title="The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.">1Chronicles 23:15-16</a>. Or is he indeed Shebuel, as St. Jerome avers, probably from Jewish tradition?--and has his name been purposely altered? It is probably from a similar dislike to reveal the disgrace which thus fell on the family of the great law-giver that Josephus entirely omits the story. It is impossible that he should not have been perfectly acquainted with it. The identity of Jonathan with Shebuel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-16.htm" title="Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.">1Chronicles 23:16</a> is asserted in the Targum, which says that "Shebuel, that is, Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, <span class= "ital">returned to the fear of Jehovah, </span>and when David saw that he was skilful in money matters, he appointed him chief over the treasures."<p><span class= "bld">Until the day of the captivity of the land.</span>--(1) If the expression meant "the captivity," as ordinarily understood, the meaning could only be that these descendants of Moses continued also to be priests of the calf-worship for nearly two centuries, until the ten tribes were carried captive by Shalmaneser and Tiglath-pileser. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-22.htm" title="For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelled in their steads until the captivity.">1Chronicles 5:22</a>.) If so, there would be a strong additional reason for identifying this worship with the calf-worship, and the fact might then be supposed to account for there being no mention of non-Levitic priests at Dan, but only at Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-33.htm" title="So he offered on the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered on the altar, and burnt incense.">1Kings 12:33</a>). (2) Some suppose that we should read "ark" (<span class= "ital">aron</span>) for "land" (<span class= "ital">arets</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/4-21.htm" title="And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.">1Samuel 4:21-22</a>.) But this conjecture of Houbigant is not supported by a single MS. or version. (3) It is far from impossible that "the captivity" may mean the Philistine captivity, which resulted from their terrible sack of Shiloh after the battle of Aphek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-11.htm" title="And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.">1Samuel 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-22.htm" title="And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.">1Samuel 4:22</a>). It is called "a captivity" in the passage which so graphically describes the scene in Ps. 88:58-61. Otherwise we may suppose (4) that "the land" has here a circumscribed sense, and that "the captivity" alluded to is one inflicted on the Danites by the kings of Zobah. or some other Syrian invasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1Samuel 14:47</a>). The <span class= "ital">third </span>explanation is, however, rendered almost certain by the following verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Dan</span>, etc. It was probably the long existence of this semi-idolatrous worship of the graven image at Dan that induced King Jeroboam to set up one of his golden calves at Dan, as we read <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh</span>. The Hebrew text really has <span class="accented">the son of Moses.</span> But a little <span class="accented">n</span> is written above the line between the M and the S of Moses (Mosheh), so as to be read <span class="accented">Manasseh</span>, as thus: MSH; so that they avoided the pain of reading aloud that the grandson or descendant of Moses was an idolatrous priest, without actually altering the written text. It is indeed most sad that it should have been so, though like examples are not wanting, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the sons of Eli and of Samuel. For Gershom the son of Moses see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm">Exodus 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-3.htm">Exodus 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-14.htm">1 Chronicles 23:14-16</a>. It does not follow that Jonathan, the priest of the Danites, was literally the son of Gershom. It may merely mean that he was of the family of which Gershom was the head. <span class="cmt_word">Until the day of the captivity of the land</span>. There is great diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this phrase. Many understand it, as is the obvious meaning of the words, of the Assyrian captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). But some of the best commentators, as Kimchi among the Jews, and many moderns, think it refers to the taking captive of the ark by the Philistines in the days of Eli, because this is the time indicated in the next verse by the mention of the house of God in Shiloh. The ark of God never returned to Shiloh after it was taken thence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a>) and captured by the Philistines (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 11). It is also noticed that the expression, <span class="accented">The ark of God is gone into captivity</span> (is <span class="accented">taken</span>, A.V.), occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21, 22</a>. It certainly would be strange that one verse (30) should speak of the worship of the graven image lasting till the Assyrian conquest of the land, and the next verse (31) limit it to the time that the house of God was in Shiloh, some 300 years earlier. At the same time it should be noticed that ver. 30 speaks of the time that Jonathan's sons were priests to the tribe of Dan, and ver. 31 of the worship of Micah's image. It is quite possible that the descendants of Jonathan may have been appointed priests at Dan to Jeroboam's golden-calf worship, though the original graven image of Micah may have been destroyed by Saul or David; and in the interval between such destruction of Micah's image and the setting up of Jeroboam's calves they may have been the priests of an irregular worship on a high place at Tell-el-Kady. And this would enable us to give what is certainly its natural meaning to the words, "the captivity of the land." But no certainty can be arrived at without more actual knowledge. Many commentators adopt Houbigant's conjecture to read <span class="accented">ark</span> for <span class="accented">land</span> at the end of ver. 30 (<span class="accented">aron</span> for <span class="accented">aretz</span>). Others think that some deportation of the Danites by the Syrians or other neighbouring people not recorded in history is here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">All the time the house of God</span>, etc. This must have been written not earlier than the time of Samuel, and possibly much later. The house of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tabernacle, was in Shiloh from the days of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) till the days of Eli (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), after which we have no account of where the house of God was till the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by King David from the house of Obed-edom the Gittite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>), and placed in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>); but whether this was the tabernacle that had been pitched at Shiloh or a new one does not appear. It is not improbable that Samuel may have moved the tabernacle from Shiloh to Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>). The ark had rested in the house of Abinadab at Baaleh or Kirjath-jearim for twenty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>) previous to its removal by David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
