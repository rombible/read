It is four miles from Paneas and Caesarea Philippi, and was the northernmost city of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.">Judges 20:1</a>). As such, its name recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm" title="Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.">Isaiah 10:30</a>, if our version is there correct. It is sometimes called <span class= "ital">el-Leddan, </span>because it is at the source of the Leddan, the chief stream of the Jordan. The position of the town, on a round hill girt with trees, is very striking, and fully bears out the description of this chapter (Robinson, <span class= "ital">Bible Res. </span>3:392). The <span class= "ital">name "</span>Dan" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm" title="And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.">Genesis 14:14</a> may have been altered from Laish at a later date (Ewald, <span class= "ital">Gesch. </span>1:73).<p><span class= "bld">After the manner of the Zidonians</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> <span class= "ital">in luxurious commercial ease. </span>There can be little doubt that they were a colony from Zidon.<p><span class= "bld">Quiet and secure . . . There are three peculiarities in this clause:</span>--(1) Although the word for "people" (<span class= "ital">am</span>) is masculine, yet the word for "dwelling" (<span class= "ital">yoshebeth</span>) is feminine, perhaps because the writer had the word "city" in his mind, just as <span class= "greekheb">????? </span>is feminine in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-14.htm" title="But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.">Acts 27:14</a>, though the word for "ship" has been neuter, because the writer has <span class= "greekheb"><span class= "ital">????</span> <span class= "greekheb"></span></span>in his mind. (2) The word for "careless" and the word for "secure" are from the same root, and are tautological. (3) The clause "no magistrate," &c., is curiously expressed. It is difficult not to suppose that the text is in some way corrupt.<p><span class= "bld">There was no magistrate . . . </span>This difficult clause seems to mean, "no one possessing wealth" (LXX., "heir of treasure") "among them doing harm in the land in any matter." The various versions differ widely from each other, and the text is almost certainly corrupt.<p><span class= "bld">They were far from the Zidonians.</span>--As Josephus says, the town is a day's journey distant from Zidon.<p><span class= "bld">No business with any man.</span>--The reading of some MSS. of the LXX., "They had no business with Syria," rises from reading <span class= "ital">Aram </span>for <span class= "ital">Adam.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Laish</span>. Called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a> <span class="accented">Leshem</span>, which is perhaps a corruption caused by the statement that they called it after the name (<span class="accented">Ke-shem</span>) of Dan, or it may be only another form. The name is strangely corrupted in the Septuagint of ver. 29 of this chapter into <span class="accented">Oulamais</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a> into <span class="accented">Lesem-dan.</span> St. Jerome, misled by the Septuagint, has <span class="accented">Lesem Dan.</span> Laish was situated four Roman miles from Bahias, on the road to. Tyre, on one of the sources of the Jordan. Robinson identifies it unhesitatingly with <span class="accented">Tell-el-Kady</span>, "the mount of the judge" (where <span class="accented">Kady</span> has the same meaning as <span class="accented">Dan</span>), close to the great fountain, "one of the largest fountains in the world," called <span class="accented">el-Leddan</span>, which is the source of the lesser Jordan (Josephus), and which may very possibly be the ultimate form of ed-Dan, corrupted into Eddan, el-Eddan, Led-dan, el-Leddan, by successive incorporations of the article <span class="accented">el</span> into the word itself, of which there are other examples. The remainder of this verse is exceedingly obscure; a probable translation is as follows: "And they saw the people that was in the midst of it dwelling in security after the manner of the Zidonians, '<span class="accented">quiet and secure</span>, <span class="accented">and none doing any injury to any one in the land</span>, <span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>;' and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man." The words in italics are probably a poetical quotation, descriptive of the people of Laish, which would account for the peculiar diction and the grammatical changes; for whereas the word <span class="accented">dwelling</span> is in the feminine gender, agreeing with <span class="accented">people</span>, the words <span class="accented">quiet</span> and <span class="accented">secure</span> and <span class="accented">possessing</span> are in the masculine, which can be readily accounted for if they are a quotation. This would also account for the tautology, "dwelling in security," "quiet and secure," and for the poetical character of the phrase "<span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>," and for the unusual form of the word here rendered <span class="accented">wealth</span> (<span class="accented">etzer</span> with an ain, instead of the usual <span class="accented">otzar</span> with an aleph), in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate and Gesenius, who derive the meaning of <span class="accented">wealth</span> from <span class="accented">collecting</span>, from which the common word <span class="accented">atzereth</span> derives its meaning of a <span class="accented">collection</span> or <span class="accented">congregation</span> of people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
