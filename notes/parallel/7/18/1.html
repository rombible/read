(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm" title="And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?">Judges 18:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-12.htm" title="And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?">Judges 20:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Sought them an inheritance.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm" title="And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:">Judges 1:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47-48</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them.</span>--Their inheritance is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/19-40.htm" title="And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.">Joshua 19:40-46</a>. The inheritance had been <span class= "ital">assigned </span>to them; but they had not been able to conquer it, owing to the opposition of the Philistines and the Amorates. The English Version interpolates the words "all their" before "inheritance," apparently to avoid difficulties. But these glosses, however well meant, are almost always a violation of the primary duty of translation, which is to be rigidly faithful to the* original. The failure of the Danites to conquer their allotment, and the low condition to which they dwindled, are the more remarkable because in the wilderness they were the strongest of all the tribes, numbering 62,700, and because they received the <span class= "ital">smallest </span>assignment of land of all the tribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days</span>, etc. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance</span>, etc. This does not mean that the whole tribe of Dan were still seeking their inheritance. The bulk of the tribe, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>, did receive their inheritance by lot before the death of Joshua (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 49) and Eleazar (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 51). But as long as any part of the tribe was not settled, the tribe as such, in its unity, was still seeking a settlement. The land for their inheritance had not yet fallen to the tribe in its integrity. This is in part accounted for by what we read <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>, that the Amorites would not suffer the children of Dan to come down to the valley, so that those who could not get possession of their land there would be crowded into other parts of the tribal territory. These Danites, of whom we are here reading, were dwelling in Zorah and Eshtaol (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1, 25</a>), as we see by vers. 2, 11. <span class="cmt_word">Unto that day</span>, etc. Translate this clause, <span class="accented">For unto that day</span> the land (meaning <span class="accented">the whole land</span>) <span class="accented">had not fallen unto them in the midst of the tribes of Israel for an inheritance.</span> The words <span class="accented">the land</span> must be supplied after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>. What follows in this chapter is a more detailed account of what was briefly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>, where, however, the A.V. <span class="accented">went out too little</span> for them is not a translation of the Hebrew text, which is very difficult to explain. Houbigant, by an ingenious conjecture, gives the sense <span class="accented">was too narrow for them.</span> Prom the mention of this migration in the Book of Joshua, it is probable that it took place not many years after Joshua's death. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
