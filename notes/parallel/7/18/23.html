Dan showed himself in this proceeding like "a serpent on the way, an adder in the path" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm" title="Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.">Genesis 49:17</a>).

It is the idea of the clan, or family, or tribe which causes the phrase. Just as <span class="accented">Israel</span> or <span class="accented">Judah</span> designates the whole nation, or the whole tribe, under the name of their patriarch, so here Micah would include all the clan who dwelt in Micah's house; and hence the Danites speak of Micah being gathered together. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
