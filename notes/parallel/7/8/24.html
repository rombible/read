It was perhaps not without significance that mention was made in ver. 21 of his taking the ornaments that were on the camels' necks in connection with the slaughter of the kings. Anyhow we have now a second instance of a love of spoil. It seems to have been a national custom with the Ishmaelites, among whom the Midianites are reckoned (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25-28</a>), to wear golden rings; hence when they came to strip the slain there was a vast booty of gold rings.

Gesenius mentions having seen at Leipsic some Indian dancing women with nose-rings. It is distinctly marked as a nose-ring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22, 30, 47</a>, because in the last verse Abraham's servant says that he "<span class="accented">put</span> <span class="accented">the ring</span> (<span class="accented">han-nezem</span>) <span class="accented">upon her nose"</span> (<span class="accented">face</span>, A.V.). Again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a> the Hebrew is, "I <span class="accented">placed a ring upon thy nose"</span> (I put a jewel upon thy forehead, A.V.). So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>, "<span class="accented">one</span> <span class="accented">ring of gold</span>," implies that it was a nose-ring, and not an ear-ring. In other passages, however, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>, it is expressly said that these rings were worn in the ears; while in others, again, there is nothing to mark whether they were worn in the ears or in the nose, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>, except that in the latter passage the singular number in the Hebrew is more favourable to the <span class="accented">nose-ring</span> than to the <span class="accented">ear-rings</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the A.V. translates it. It is thought by many, with some probability, that the nose-ring did not pierce the gristle of the nose, but hung down upon the nose from a fillet round the forehead. In every case they were of gold. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-28 Gideon refused the government the people offered him. No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God. Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod, made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family. How soon will ornaments which feed the lust of the eye, and form the pride of life, as well as tend to the indulgences of the flesh, bring shame on those who are fond of them!</body></html>
