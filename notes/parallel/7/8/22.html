but they forgot that Gideon had received a special call from God. and that, as Gideon reminded them. God was their king. Yet no doubt the memory of Gideon deepened the wish which Samuel was afterwards commanded to grant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.">2Samuel 8:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-12.htm" title="For you did it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.">2Samuel 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-17.htm" title="And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.">2Samuel 12:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rule thou</span>, etc. The gratitude of Israel to their great deliverer, added to a sense that it would be for their own security, and to a desire, already perhaps beginning to he felt, to be like the nations around them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), naturally led to the offer, "Rule thou over us." But the time predicted by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14, 15</a>) was not yet come. And so Gideon returned an answer replete with moderation and piety: "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-28 Gideon refused the government the people offered him. No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God. Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod, made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family. How soon will ornaments which feed the lust of the eye, and form the pride of life, as well as tend to the indulgences of the flesh, bring shame on those who are fond of them!</body></html>
