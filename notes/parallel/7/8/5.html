It was situated in the tribe of Gad, and is probably the <span class= "ital">Sukkot </span>mentioned by Burckhardt as on the east of Jordan, south wards from Bethshean. The "valley of Succoth" is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm" title="God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.">Psalm 60:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-7.htm" title="God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.">Psalm 108:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Loaves of bread.</span>--The loaves are round cakes (<span class= "ital">ciccar</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>His request was a very modest and considerate one. He did not "requisition" them for forces, or for intelligence, or for any active assistance, because he might bear in mind that they on the east of Jordan would, in case of any reverse or incomplete victory, be the first to feel the vengeance of the neighbouring-Midianites. But to supply bread to their own hungry countrymen, who were fighting their battles, was an act of common humanity which even the Midianites could not greatly resent.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the people that follow me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">which is at my feet, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-10.htm" title="And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.">Judges 4:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Zebah and Zalmunna.</span>--These were Emirs of higher rank than the Sheykhs Oreb and Zeeb, though Josephus calls them only "leaders," while he calls Oreb and Zeeb "kings." <span class= "ital">Zebah </span>means "a sacrifice," perhaps one who had been consecrated by his parents to the gods of Midian. <span class= "ital">Zalmunna </span>seems to mean "shadow of an exile," or, according to Gesenius, "shelter is denied him"--an unintelligible name, but perhaps due to some unknown incident. They are called "kings of Midian" (<span class= "ital">malkai Midian</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm" title="And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.">Numbers 31:8</a>. Oreb and Zeeb are only called <span class= "ital">Sarim, </span>the same title as that given to Sisera (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm" title="And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.">Judges 4:2</a>), and in the next verse to the elders of Succoth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Succoth</span>. On the east side of Jordan, as appears plainly from the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17, 18</a>; for we read there that Jacob journeyed from Mount Gilead to Mahanaim, thence to Penuel, and from Pe-nuel to Succoth, so called from the <span class="accented">booths</span> or tabernacles which he made for his cattle; and that after leaving Succoth he came to the city of Shechem (called Shalem)," in the land of Canaan," showing that Succoth was not in the land of Canaan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> we are also distinctly told that Succoth was in the trans-Jordanic tribe of Gad (which lay south of the Jabbok), in the valley of the Jordan, where its proximity to <span class="accented">Mahanaim</span> (vers. 26, 30) shows it to be the same place as Jacob's <span class="accented">Succoth</span>, which was also near the Jabbok (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>). The identification of Succoth with any modern representative is very uncertain. Jerome mentions a trans-Jordanic place named Soc-<span class="accented">hoth</span>, in the region of Beth-shan, or Scythe-polls; and Burkhardt also mentions a place described by him as "the ruins of Sukkot," two hours from Bysan (Beth-shan), and on the east of Jordan. But this, as well as the <span class="accented">Sakut</span> of Robinson and Van de Velde, on the west of Jordan, about ten miles south of Beth-shan, is too far north for the Suceoth of Jacob, which is shown to be the same as the Succoth of Gideon by the connection of the latter with Penuel (ver. 8), and which, as above noticed, is shown to be the same as the Succoth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13</a>. by its proximity to Mahanaim. We must await some further light before we can decide the exact position of Succoth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-12 Gideon's men were faint, yet pursuing; fatigued with what they had done, yet eager to do more against their enemies. It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.</body></html>
