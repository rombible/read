This would imply a very large number of nose-rings or earrings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;">Genesis 24:22</a>), and therefore a slaughter of many leading Midianites. It is analogous to the "three bushels of knights' rings" which Mago carried to Carthage, and emptied upon the floor of the Carthaginian Senate, after the massacre of the Romans at Cannae (Liv. xxiii. 12).<p><span class= "bld">Beside ornaments.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">beside the golden crescents </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-21.htm" title="Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us: for as the man is, so is his strength.

If the rings, like that given to Rebekah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>), weighed each half a shekel, they would be the spoil of 3400 dead bodies. If they each weighed less it would of course imply a larger number of slain. The ornaments, as in ver. 21, <span class="accented">the collars.</span> The word so rendered seems rather to mean <span class="accented">drops</span> or <span class="accented">pendants.</span> When worn by women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-19.htm">Isaiah 3:19</a>, <span class="accented">chains</span>, A.V.) they were often of single pearls. The purple raiment, the famous Tyrian purple, made from the juice of a shellfish which is found in the Mediterranean, which was the distinctive colour of royal and imperial raiment. Chains. Perhaps the <span class="accented">ornaments</span> mentioned in ver. 21 as on the camels' necks were suspended to these chains. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a> the <span class="accented">chain</span> is mentioned as an ornament of a woman's neck; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> of a man's neck. Many interpreters understand these last-mentioned articles as not being part of Gideon's spoil, but being the people's portion. But it seems much more probable that the spoil of the kings should be Gideon's portion, as indeed ver. 21 implies. It is best, therefore, to take all these articles as being the property of the kings, and to understand the writer to tell us that Gideon had the rings, which were the people's spoil, in addition to all the spoil which naturally fell to his own share. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-28 Gideon refused the government the people offered him. No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God. Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod, made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family. How soon will ornaments which feed the lust of the eye, and form the pride of life, as well as tend to the indulgences of the flesh, bring shame on those who are fond of them!</body></html>
