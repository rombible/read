It was originally called Kenath, but the name was altered in honour of a Manassite hero, who is otherwise unrecorded. Jewish tradition says that he was born in Egypt, and died during the passage of the Jordan (<span class= "ital">Seder Olam Rabba</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The original name displaced its rival, for the site is now called <span class= "ital">Kenawat.</span><p><span class= "bld">Jogbehah.</span>--In Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a>).

They fancied themselves beyond the reach of pursuit because they miscalculated the energy and powers of Gideon, who, not improbably, once more attacked them by night.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gideon went up</span>. See ver. 8, note. Implying that his direction was eastward away from the Jordan valley. Nobah was in the half-tribe of Manasseh. Nobah, who gave his name to the city, which was before called <span class="accented">Kenath</span>, seems to have been of the family of Machir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>). Jogbehah was in the tribe of Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-35.htm">Numbers 32:35</a>). These two cities appear to have been on the eastern frontier of their respective tribes, but the exact site of them is utterly unknown. It is a conjecture that possibly <span class="accented">Kunawat</span> may be <span class="accented">Nobah</span>, retaining its ancient name of <span class="accented">Kenath.</span> East of these cities was the desert, inhabited by nomads dwelling in tents, where Karkor was, and where Zebah and Zalmunna had encamped out of reach, as they thought, of their pursuers. But Gideon, falling suddenly upon them, routed the host, and took the two kings prisoners (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-11.htm">Psalm 83:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-12 Gideon's men were faint, yet pursuing; fatigued with what they had done, yet eager to do more against their enemies. It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.</body></html>
