If so, it implies that he came round by some other road to attack Succoth. The word for "going up" is <span class= "ital">maaleh, </span>as in <span class= "ital">Maaleh Ahrabbim, </span>"the ascent of scorpions" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-36.htm" title="And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.">Judges 1:36</a>), which is also applied to sunrise. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-15.htm" title="And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.">Genesis 19:15</a>.) It cannot possibly mean "before <span class= "ital">sunset</span>" (<span class= "ital">ehe die Sonne heraufgekommen war</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as Luther renders it, following the Chaldee and various Rabbis. The ordinary word for "sun" is <span class= "ital">shemesh, </span>not <span class= "ital">cheres; </span>but the latter word occurs in various names (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Judges 1:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm" title="And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.">Judges 2:9</a>), which makes it perhaps more probable that this also is the name of some place. It might, indeed, be prudent for Gideon to desist from further pursuit when the dawn revealed the paucity and exhaustion of his followers; and in poetic style (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm" title="Which commands the sun, and it rises not; and seals up the stars.">Job 9:7</a>) <span class= "ital">cheres </span>may mean "sun," so that here the phrase <span class= "ital">might </span>be an archaism, as <span class= "ital">cheresah </span>is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-18.htm" title="And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.">Judges 14:18</a>; but the preposition used <span class= "ital">(min</span>) cannot mean "before." Aquila renders it "from the ascent <span class= "ital">of the groves" </span>and Symmachus "of the <span class= "ital">mountains;" </span>but this is only due to a defective reading.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the sun was up</span>. There is a wonderful diversity in the renderings of this verse. Some of the old versions and Jewish Rabbis interpret it <span class="accented">before sunset.</span> Many of the best Jewish commentators, however, understand the phrase as the A.V. does - "Before the going up of the sun," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before sunrise; supposing Gideon's attack on the Midianitish camp to have been a night attack, and Succoth to have been so near to Karkor that he was able to reach it by sunrise. But others say that the word here rendered <span class="accented">sun</span> (<span class="accented">heres</span>) is only used in poetry, and that the word rendered up is never used of sunrise, but, as, in the phrase "the going up of Akrabbim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>), of an ascent up a hill. They therefore take <span class="accented">heres</span> as a proper name, and translate "from the going up of Hems." Others again, by an almost imperceptible change in the last letter, read "the mountains" instead of <span class="accented">Heres.</span> But the A.V. may be well defended, and gives an excellent sense. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-18.htm">Judges 14:18</a> the same word for the sun is used in the very similar phrase, "before the sun went down." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a> the phrase, "the morning arose," has the verb from which the word here rendered <span class="accented">up</span> is derived; and a note of time here exactly suits the context. It marks the celerity of Gideon's move. ments that he was actually on his way back to Succoth at sunrise, after having routed the Midianites and taken their two kings prisoners. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:13-17 The active servants of the Lord meet with more dangerous opposition from false professors than from open enemies; but they must not care for the behaviour of those who are Israelites in name, but Midianites in heart. They must pursue the enemies of their souls, and of the cause of God, though they are ready to faint through inward conflicts and outward hardships. And they shall be enabled to persevere. The less men help, and the more they seek to hinder, the more will the Lord assist. Gideon's warning being slighted, the punishment was just. Many are taught with the briers and thorns of affliction, who would not learn otherwise.</body></html>
