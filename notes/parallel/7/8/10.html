Eusebius and Jerome identify Karkor with a fortress named <span class= "ital">Karkaria, </span>a day's journey north of Petra; but, from the mention of Nobah and Jogbehah in the next verse, this seems to be too far south.

It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.</body></html>
