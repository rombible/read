This arrogance was destined, as we shall see later, to bring on them a terrible humiliation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.">Judges 12:1</a>). The complaint was fiercely urged, probably at the time when, by bringing the heads of Oreb and Zeeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm" title="And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb on the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.">Judges 7:25</a>), they had proved both their power and their fidelity to the national cause. What they wanted was the acknowledgment of their claims (their <span class= "ital">hegemony, </span>as the Greeks would have called it) by all the tribes.<p><span class= "bld">They did chide with him sharply.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">with force </span>or <span class= "ital">violence, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-16.htm" title="And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, No; but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.">1Samuel 2:16</a>, so that the Vulg. renders it, <span class= "ital">jurgantes fortiter, et prope vim inferentes, </span>"strongly reproaching him, and almost treating him with violence."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Ephraim</span>. It is possible that the transfer of the birthright from Manasseh to Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-13.htm">Genesis 48:13-19</a>) may have produced some estrangement between the tribes. It is also possible that Ephraim, in view of their great tribal power, and the distinction conferred upon them by the judgeship of Joshua the son of Nun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>), and the possession of his grave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a>), may have grown haughty and domineering, and perhaps more disposed to rest upon their former glories than to embark in fresh undertakings. Anyhow Gideon did not consult them, nor ask their aid, in the first instance. Now that the war had been so successful, the men of Ephraim were much displeased at not having been consulted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-3 Those who will not attempt or venture any thing in the cause of God, will be the most ready to censure and quarrel with such as are of a more zealous and enterprising spirit. And those who are the most backward to difficult services, will be the most angry not to have the credit of them. Gideon stands here as a great example of self-denial; and shows us that envy is best removed by humility. The Ephraimites had given vent to their passion in very wrong freedom of speech, a certain sign of a weak cause: reason runs low when chiding flies high.</body></html>
