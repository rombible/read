The sequel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/9-1.htm" title="And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,">Judges 9:1-4</a>) seems to show that she belonged to the Canaanite population of Shechem. If so, Gideon's conduct in making her a concubine was as much against the Mosaic law as that of Solomon, though it may have had the same colour of worldly expediency. But it is probable that the requirements of the Mosaic law were much better known in the reign of Solomon, when the priests had once more become influential, than they were in this anarchical period. This concubine exercised an influence sufficiently important to cause the preservation of her name by tradition--Drumah (Jos. <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 7, ? 1).<p><span class= "bld">Whose name he called Abimelech.</span>--For "called" the margin has <span class= "ital">set. </span>The phrase is not the ordinary one, and perhaps implies that Abimelech (Father-king--"a king, my father") was a surname given him by his father on observing his ambitious and boastful character. It seems more probable that the name was given by the Shechemites and his mother, and it may not have been without some influence for evil upon his ultimate career. The name has exactly the same significance as Padishah and Attalik, the title of the Khan of Bokhara (Gesenius). Being a well-understood dynastic title (Genesis 20; Psalms 34 title), it would be all the more significant. He was like a bad reproduction of Gideon, with the courage and energy of his father, but with none of his virtues.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose name he called</span>. This is badly translated; it should he, he <span class="accented">gave him the name of Abimelech - literally</span>, <span class="accented">he set his name Abimelech.</span> There are two phrases in Hebrew. The one, he <span class="accented">called his name</span> Seth, Noah, Ishmael, Isaac, Esau, Jacob, etc., as the case may be. And this is the phrase always, though not exclusively (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>), used of the name given to a child at its birth or circumcision. The other is, he <span class="accented">gave</span> or <span class="accented">set him the</span> name, or, <span class="accented">he gave</span> or <span class="accented">set his name</span> so-and-so, and this phrase is only used of additional names, or surnames given later in life. The examples are Judges 13:31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-34.htm">2 Kings 17:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-7.htm">Daniel 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>. The inference is that the name of <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>, which means <span class="accented">father of a king</span>, and was the name of the royal family of Gerar, was given to Abimelech as a significant surname, and was perhaps one of the causes which induced him to seize the kingdom. A third phrase is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-4.htm">2 Chronicles 36:4</a>: <span class="accented">he turned his name to Jehoiakim</span>; <span class="accented">changed his name to Zedekiah.</span> The Hebrew is the same in all these passages. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:29-35 As soon as Gideon was dead, who kept the people to the worship of the God of Israel, they found themselves under no restraint; then they went after Baalim, and showed no kindness to the family of Gideon. No wonder if those who forget their God, forget their friends. Yet conscious of our own ingratitude to the Lord, and observing that of mankind in general, we should learn to be patient under any unkind returns we meet with for our poor services, and resolve, after the Divine example, not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.</body></html>
