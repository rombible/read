The ruthlessness of the punishment which he threatened to inflict belongs to the wild times in which he lived, and the very partial spiritual enlightenment of an imperfect dispensation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:">Matthew 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm" title="He said to them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.">Matthew 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>). It is no more to be held up for approval or imitation than his subsequent degeneracy; while, at the same time, Gideon must, of course, be only judged by such light as he had.<p><span class= "bld">I will tear your flesh.</span>--Rather, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">I will thresh </span>(LXX., <span class= "ital">alo?so, </span>which is better than the other reading, <span class= "ital">kataxano, </span>"will card"; Vulg., <span class= "ital">conteram</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>It has usually been supposed that they were scourged with thorns, which would be terrible enough; but the verb here used is stronger, and seems to imply that they were "put under harrows" after thorns and briers had been scattered over them. That Gideon should inflict a retribution so awful cannot be surprising if we remember that David seems to have done the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm" title="And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.">2Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon.

In this case, however, the torture was more terrible, because it was inflicted not on aliens, but on Israelites. It must be borne in mind that every man is largely influenced by the spirit of the age in which he lives, and that in the East to this day there is (1) far greater indifference than there is in Europe to the value of human life, and (2) far greater insensibility to the infliction of pain; so that the mere mention of punishments inflicted, even in this century, by such men as Djezzar and Mehemet Ali makes the blood run cold. It was only by slow degrees that (as we can trace in the writings of their prophets and historians) the Jews learnt that deeper sense of humanity which it was certainly the object of many precepts of the Mosaic Law to inspire. The defections of Succoth and Penuel were even worse than that indifference of Meroz which had called forth the bitter curse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-23.htm" title="Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.">Judges 5:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">With the thorns of the wilderness.</span>--These thorns (<span class= "ital">kotsim</span>) are again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-8.htm" title="The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.">Hosea 10:8</a>. Rabbi Tanchum could not explain what plant was meant. It is not impossible (as Kimchi suggests) that the form of the punishment was suggested by another wild play on words; for <span class= "ital">Succoth </span>(<span class= "greekheb">???????</span>), though it means "booths," suggests the idea of "thorns" (<span class= "greekheb">????</span>),<p><span class= "bld">Briers.</span>--This word, <span class= "ital">barkanim, </span>which the LXX. merely transliterate, occurs nowhere else. The Rabbis rightly understood it of thorny plants which grow among stones. Some modern Hebraists explain it to mean harrows formed of flints, deriving it from an obsolete word, <span class= "ital">barkan, </span>"lightning" (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm" title="And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?">Judges 4:6</a>), and so meaning "pyrites." In that case we must suppose that the elders were laid on some open area, and harrows set with flints driven over them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will tear your flesh</span>, etc. These words breathe a fierce and vindictive spirit; such, however, as cannot surprise us m the age and country of which we arc reading (cf. vers. 9 and 21). The provocation, it must be allowed, was very great, but still the spirit was very different from that which dictated the prayer under far greater provocation, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Thorns of the wilderness. The nature of the punishment here threatened, and the execution of which is related in ver. 16, is uncertain. The word here rendered tear means literally to thresh,. Hence some suppose that the punishment here spoken of was a severe kind of capital punishment inflicted by threshing instruments with sharp iron points, called here "thorns of the wilderness," and "briers (though some again understand literally <span class="accented">thorns</span> and <span class="accented">briers</span>); and they compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>, where the word rendered <span class="accented">harrows</span> means <span class="accented">threshing instruments</span>, as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>. But others, as Bertheau, Keil, and Delitzsch, do not think it was a capital punishment at all, and take the word <span class="accented">thresh</span> figuratively in the sense of <span class="accented">punishing severely</span>, and think that literal thorns and thistles were the implements of punishment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-12 Gideon's men were faint, yet pursuing; fatigued with what they had done, yet eager to do more against their enemies. It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.</body></html>
