When Jacob was returning from Padan-aram to Canaan he reached Penuel first, and Succoth afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>). Gideon, travelling in the opposite direction from Canaan, naturally reaches Succoth first, and Penuel afterwards. Going from Succoth to Penuel too, he <span class="accented">went up</span> out of the Jordan valley towards the mountains on the east. Penuel appears to have been a place of importance, since Jeroboam repaired its fortifications with a view of retaining his hold on trans-Jordanic Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). The <span class="accented">tower</span> here mentioned shows it was a strong place, but its exact situation is unknown. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-12 Gideon's men were faint, yet pursuing; fatigued with what they had done, yet eager to do more against their enemies. It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.</body></html>
