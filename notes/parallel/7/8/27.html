It was a sleeveless coat of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, with two ouches of onyx on the shoulders, bound by a rich girdle. Over this was worn the splendid jewelled breastplate, the <span class= "ital">choshen, </span>with the Urim and Thummim. This ephod, with its "oracular gems," was by far the most splendid and sacred adjunct of worship which the Israelites possessed, and hence was regarded with extreme reverence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm" title="And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.">1Samuel 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1Samuel 30:7</a>), and it seems clear that Gideon's object was to provide a counter-attraction to it in an ephod of equally precious materials. It is a mistake to suppose (as Gesenius and others do, following the Peshito and Arabic versions) that <span class= "ital">ephod </span>here means an idol or some unauthorised symbol of Jehovah, like the later "calves." Ewald, too (<span class= "ital">Alterthmer, </span>p. 232), assumes that the <span class= "ital">"</span>ephod" was really "a gilded household idol." But we may hope that Gideon, though guilty of a great sin, had not sunk quite so low as Jeroboam did. On the other hand, we cannot believe, with the Rabbis, that his ephod was only intended as a memorial of his victory.<p><span class= "bld">Thereof.</span>--This does not necessarily imply that he devoted the <span class= "ital">whole </span>of his mass of gold to this object. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-13.htm" title="And I will visit on her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, said the LORD.">Hosea 2:13</a>, "decking herself with earrings" is one of the signs of the "days of Baalim." Hence, perhaps, an earring is called in Chaldee <span class= "ital">kaddisha.</span><p><span class= "bld">Put it in his city, even in Ophrah.</span>--This gives us a clue to Gideon's motive. Shiloh, the national sanctuary, was in the precincts of the fierce tribe of Ephraim, and Gideon may have been as anxious as Jeroboam afterwards was to keep some direct hold on the nation's worship, as one of the secrets of political power. It was the endeavour to secure and perpetuate by unworthy political expedients a power which he had received by Divine appointment.<p><span class= "bld">Went thither a whoring after it.</span>--The phrase and the metaphor are sufficiently explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.">Judges 8:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-12.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.">Judges 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm" title="And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.">Leviticus 17:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-5.htm" title="Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit prostitution with Molech, from among their people.">Leviticus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm" title="The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitutions and children of prostitutions: for the land has committed great prostitution, departing from the LORD.">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-39.htm" title="Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.">Psalm 106:39</a>, &c. As to the nature of the schismatic service we are told nothing further. The strange narrative of Judges 18 shows us the decadence and disintegration of the national worship at this period, and it is far from improbable that Gideon may have associated his worship with an unauthorised priesthood and modes of diviuation, if not with teraphim, &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>). (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm" title="And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to you.">Judges 17:3</a>.) His already existing altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm" title="Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.">Judges 6:24</a>) would promote his object. It does not seem likely that the high priest at Shiloh would abandon the use of his own proper "breastplate of judgment;" but his acquiescence during this epoch of oppression would go far to invalidate his authority. If Hierombalos be meant for Jerubbaal (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm" title="Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.">Judges 6:32</a>), he is represented as having been <span class= "ital">a priest.</span><p><span class= "bld">A snare.</span>--The word used is <span class= "ital">mokesh, </span>which implies not only a stumbling-block (LXX., <span class= "ital">skandalon</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but also "a cause of ruin" (<span class= "ital">in ruinam., </span>Vulg., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm" title="And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?">Exodus 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm" title="They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me: for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.">Exodus 23:33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gideon made an ephod thereof</span>. There is great difference of opinion among commentators as to the significance of this statement. The ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4, 6-30</a>) was that part of the high priest's dress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>) which covered the breast in front, and the upper part of the back behind, the two parts being clasped together by two large onyx stones, one on each shoulder, and kept together by the curious girdle, just above which was fastened the breastplate of judgment. In a modified form the "linen ephod" was worn by all priests; but it was especially worn by the high priest when he inquired of God by Urim and Thummim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>). Hence it was also connected with idolatrous worship, as we see by ch. Judges 17:5, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>, being probably used for purposes of divination, as we know that idolatrous kings of Israel, instead of inquiring of the Lord, inquired of the false gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2, 3</a>). What, then, was Gideon's purpose in making this costly ephod? We may infer from his proved piety that at all events his intention was to do honour to the Lord, who had given him the victory. Then, as he was now at the head of the State, though he had declined the regal office, and as it was the special prerogative of the head of the State to "inquire of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 28:6, etc.), he may have thought it his right, as well as a matter of great importance to the people, that he should have the means ready at hand of inquiring of God. His relations with the great tribe of Ephraim may have made it inconvenient to go to Shiloh to consult the high priest there, and therefore he would have the ephod at his own city of Ophrah, just as Jephthah made Mizpeh his religious centre (ch. Judges 11:11). Whether he sent for the high priest to come to Ophrah, or whether he made use of the ministry of some other priest, we have no means of deciding. The people, however, always prone to idolatry, made an idol of the ephod, and Gideon, either because it was a source of gain or of dignity to his house, or thinking it was a means of keeping the people from Baal-worship (ver. 33), seems to have connived at it. This seems to be the explanation best supported by the little we know of the circumstances of the case. A snare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>, that which leads a person to eventual destruction. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>, where Pharaoh's servants say of Moses, <span class="accented">How long shall this man be a snare unto us?</span> See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-21.htm">1 Samuel 18:21</a>, etc. Observe in this verse how the narrative runs on far beyond the present time, to return again at ver. 28 (see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:22-28 Gideon refused the government the people offered him. No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God. Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod, made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family. How soon will ornaments which feed the lust of the eye, and form the pride of life, as well as tend to the indulgences of the flesh, bring shame on those who are fond of them!</body></html>
