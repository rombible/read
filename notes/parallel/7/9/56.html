They are inserted to show that God punishes both individual and national crimes, and that men's pleasant vices are made the instruments to scourge them.

It is remarkable that the sacred writer, in calling attention to the righteous vengeance which fell upon the head of Abimelech, marks especially the conduct of Abimelech as undutiful to his father (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24-26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:50-57 The Shechemites were ruined by Abimelech; now he is reckoned with, who was their leader in villany. Evil pursues sinners, and sometimes overtakes them, when not only at ease, but triumphant. Though wickedness may prosper a while, it will not prosper always. The history of mankind, if truly told, would greatly resemble that of this chapter. The records of what are called splendid events present to us such contests for power. Such scenes, though praised of men, fully explain the Scripture doctrine of the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the human heart, the force of men's lust, and the effect of Satan's influence. Lord, thou has given us thy word of truth and righteousness, O pour upon us thy spirit of purity, peace, and love, and write thy holy law in our hearts.</body></html>
