The city made an obstinate defence notwithstanding, but was taken before night, and all the inhabitants were put to the sword. The walls were then razed to the ground, and the site was sown with salt to express the wish that it might be barren and uninhabited for ever (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>, marg.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>).

When God uses men as instruments in his hand to do his work, he means one thing, and they another. That, which they hoped would have been for their welfare, proved a snare and a trap, as those will certainly find, who run to idols for shelter; such will prove a refuge of lies.</body></html>
