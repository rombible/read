We see also from the narrative of the death of Saul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-9.htm" title="He said to me again, Stand, I pray you, on me, and slay me: for anguish is come on me, because my life is yet whole in me.">2Samuel 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1Samuel 31:4</a>, how sensitive the ancients were about the manner of their death. The same feeling finds ample illustration in Homer and classic writers (Soph. <span class= "ital">Trach., </span>1,064). It was a similar feeling which made Deborah exult in the death of Sisera by the hand of a woman, and the Jews in the murder of Holofernes by Judith. It is remarkable that <span class= "ital">both </span>of the first two Israelite kings die by suicide to avoid a death of greater shame.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His armour-bearer</span> - an office of trust, entailing much intimacy. Saul loved David greatly, and he became his armor-bearer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>). Compare the similar incident of Saul and his armour-bearer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4-6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:50-57 The Shechemites were ruined by Abimelech; now he is reckoned with, who was their leader in villany. Evil pursues sinners, and sometimes overtakes them, when not only at ease, but triumphant. Though wickedness may prosper a while, it will not prosper always. The history of mankind, if truly told, would greatly resemble that of this chapter. The records of what are called splendid events present to us such contests for power. Such scenes, though praised of men, fully explain the Scripture doctrine of the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the human heart, the force of men's lust, and the effect of Satan's influence. Lord, thou has given us thy word of truth and righteousness, O pour upon us thy spirit of purity, peace, and love, and write thy holy law in our hearts.</body></html>
