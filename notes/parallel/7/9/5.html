(Comp. Pope, <span class= "ital">Epistle to Arbuthnot: </span>"Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne.") There is little affection and much jealousy in polygamous households. Abimelech by this vile wickedness set a fatal precedent, which was followed again and again in the kingdom of Israel by Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:">1Kings 15:29</a>), Zimri (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that urinates against a wall, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.">1Kings 16:11</a>), Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-7.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.">2Kings 10:7</a>), and probably by other kings (2 Kings 15); and by Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm" title="And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.">2Kings 11:1</a>) in <span class= "ital">the </span>kingdom of Judah. Herod also put to death most of his kinsmen, and some of his sons (see <span class= "ital">Life of Christ, </span>i. 43). Seneca says, "Nec regna socium ferre, nec taedae sciunt"--nor realms nor weddings admit a sharer (<span class= "ital">Agam. </span>259).<p><span class= "bld">Threescore and ten persons.</span>--Jotham is counted in this number.<p><span class= "bld">Upon one stone.</span>--Perhaps on the rock on which was built Gideon's altar; at any rate, by some formal execution.

Compare the similar wholesale murders of the seventy sons of Ahab by order of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-7.htm">2 Kings 10:7</a>), of the seed royal of Judah by Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a>), of the whole house of Jeroboam by Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>), of the whole house of Baasha by Zimri (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-11.htm">1 Kings 16:11, 12</a>). Timour, on his conquest of Persia, is said to have destroyed the whole male family of the king. At the conquest of Bagdad he is said <span class="accented">to</span> have made a pyramid of 90,000 human heads. In Persia and Turkey in modern times it has been a common practice for the sovereign to slay or put out the eyes of all his brothers and cousins. So destructive of natural affection is polygamy, and so cruel is power. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 The men of Shechem chose Abimelech king. God was not consulted whether they should have any king, much less who it should be. If parents could see what their children would do, and what they are to suffer, their joy in them often would be turned into sorrow: we may be thankful that we cannot know what shall happen. Above all, we should fear and watch against sin; for our evil conduct may produce fatal effects upon our families, after we are in our graves.</body></html>
