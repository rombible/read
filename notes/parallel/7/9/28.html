It can hardly be a <span class= "ital">contrast </span>between the insignificance of Abimelech and the grandeur of Shechem (Vulg., <span class= "ital">qu? est Shechem?</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Some say that "Shechem" means "Abimelech;" but there is no trace of kings assuming the name of the place over which they rule, nor does the LXX. mend matters much by interpolating the words, "who is <span class= "ital">the son of </span>Shechem?"<p><span class= "bld">The son of Jerubbaal?</span>--And, therefore, on the father's side, disconnected both with Ephraimites and Canaanites; and the Baal-fighter's son has no claim on Baal-worshippers.<p><span class= "bld">And Zebul his officer?</span>--We are not even under the rule of Abimelech, but of his underling.<p><span class= "bld">Serve the men of Hamor.</span>--Here the LXX., Vulg., and other versions adopt a different punctuation and a different reading. But there is no reason to alter the text. The Canaanites were powerful; the Ephraimites had apostatised to their religion; even Abimelech bears a Canaanite name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>), and owed his power to his Hivite blood. Gaal says in effect. "Why should we serve this son of an upstart alien when we might return to the allegiance of the descendants of our old native prince Hamor, whose son Shechem was the <span class= "ital">hero eponymos </span>of the city?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Gaal</span>, etc. Gaal now saw his opportunity, and encouraged the revolt. <span class="cmt_word">Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?</span> The meaning of these words, though somewhat obscure at first, becomes plain if we compare the two similar passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>. In the first we have the contemptuous question, "Who is David?" and in the second the analogous one, "What portion have we in David?" but in both we have the same person described by different terms: "Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse?" and, "What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse." Here, therefore, it is clear that <span class="accented">Shechem</span> is merely another name for <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>; and it is easy to see why. Abimelech's mother was a Canaanite bond-woman, a Shechemite; and the plea for making Abimelech king was, "for he is our brother" (vers. 2, 3). <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or <span class="accented">the son of Shechem</span>, was therefore a natural description of Abimelech. But, adds Gaal, <span class="cmt_word">is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and</span> (is not) <span class="cmt_word">Zebul his officer?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is not a real Shechemite; he is the son of Jerubbaal; and what right has he to reign over you Shechemites? And why should Zebul lord it over you? He is only Abimelech's officer, <span class="cmt_word">No; serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem</span>. Fling off the yoke of the Abi-ezrite stranger, and set up a real Canaanite government from the old race of Hamor, the true founder and head of Shechem (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50-52</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:22-29 Abimelech is seated in the throne his father refused. But how long does this glory last? Stay but three years, and see the bramble withered and burned. The prosperity of the wicked is short and fickle. The Shechemites are plagued by no other hand than Abimelech's. They raised him unjustly to the throne; they first feel the weight of his sceptre.</body></html>
