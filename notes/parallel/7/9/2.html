<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm" title="And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.">Judges 9:49</a>. It is by no means impossible that the Canaanites may have still held possession of the fortress, though the Israelites were nominally predominant in the town. At any rate, this particular title of "lords," as applied to the chief people of a town, seems to have been Canaanite rather than Hebrew: the "lords" of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm" title="And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.">Joshua 24:11</a>), the "lords" of Gibeah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm" title="And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.">Judges 21:5</a>), of Keilah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-11.htm" title="Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.">1Samuel 23:11</a>). The term is applied also to the Hittite Uriah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-20.htm" title="And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say to you, Why approached you so near to the city when you did fight? knew you not that they would shoot from the wall?">2Samuel 11:20</a>). What is clear is that, as in so many other towns of Palestine at this epoch (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-32.htm" title="But the Asherites dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.">Judges 1:32</a>, &c), there was a mixed population living side by side in a sort of armed neutrality, though with a mutual dislike, which might at any time break out in tumults. The Israelites held much the same position in many towns as the Normans among the English during the years after the conquest. The Israelites had the upper hand, but they were fewer in numbers, and might easily be overborne at any particular point. It must be borne in mind also that Abimelech, as a Shechemite, would more easily win the adherence of the proud and jealous Ephraimites, who disliked the <span class= "ital">hegemony </span>(see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.">Judges 8:1</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>) which Manasseh had acquired from the victories of Gideon. The plans of Abimelech were deep-laid. In counsel no less than in courage--though both were so grievously misdirected--he shows himself his father's son.<p><span class= "bld">That all the sons of Jerubbaal . . . reign over you.</span>--It seems to have been the merest calumny to suggest that they ever dreamt of making their father's influence hereditary in this sense. Gideon had expressly repudiated all wish and claim to exercise "rule" (<span class= "ital">meshol, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-23.htm" title="And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.">Judges 8:23</a>) of this kind. The remark of Abimelech is quite in the ancient spirit--<p><span class= "greekheb">??? ?????? ????????????</span>, ??? ???????? ???<span class= "greekheb">???</span>.<p>(Comp. Eur. <span class= "ital">Suppl. </span>410.)<p><span class= "bld">Your bone and your flesh.</span>--The same phrase is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-14.htm" title="And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him the space of a month.">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm" title="Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.">2Samuel 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-12.htm" title="You are my brothers, you are my bones and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?">2Samuel 19:12</a>. He was akin to both the elements of the population: to the Ephraimites, from the place of his birth, or at any rate of his mother's residence; and to the Canaanites (as the whole narrative implies), from her blood. The plea was "like that of our Henry II., the first Norman son of a Saxon mother" (Stanley).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the sons,... which are threescore and ten persons</span>.

If parents could see what their children would do, and what they are to suffer, their joy in them often would be turned into sorrow: we may be thankful that we cannot know what shall happen. Above all, we should fear and watch against sin; for our evil conduct may produce fatal effects upon our families, after we are in our graves.</body></html>
