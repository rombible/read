Equal in value to about seven pounds; quite enough with which to hire a band of "vain and light persons," who would afterwards maintain themselves by plunder. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the house of Baal-berith</span>. The custom of collecting treasures at the temple, both that of the true God and of idols, whether they were offerings and gifts for the service of the temple, or treasures deposited there for safety, was very general (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-8.htm">1 Chronicles 29:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>, etc.). The treasures belonging to the temple of Apollo at Delphi were very great, and excited the cupidity of Xerxes, who sent an army to plunder the temple, but was foiled in the attempt. The Phocians are related to have seized 10,000 talents from the treasury of Delphi, nearly two and a half millions sterling. The temple of Diana at Ephesus had considerable treasures in money, as well as other valuable articles. Many other notices of the riches of temple treasures occur in classical writers. <span class="cmt_word">Vain and light persons</span>.

God was not consulted whether they should have any king, much less who it should be. If parents could see what their children would do, and what they are to suffer, their joy in them often would be turned into sorrow: we may be thankful that we cannot know what shall happen. Above all, we should fear and watch against sin; for our evil conduct may produce fatal effects upon our families, after we are in our graves.</body></html>
