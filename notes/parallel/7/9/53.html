But in Latimer we find "they love, and all-to love him" (see <span class= "ital">Bible Word-book, </span>? 5). The meaning of the verb is "smashed" or "shattered" (LXX., <span class= "ital">suneklase; </span>Vulg., <span class= "ital">confregit; </span>Luther, <span class= "ital">zerbrach</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The death of Pyrrhus by a tile flung down by a woman as he rode into the town of Argos is an historic parallel (Pausan. 1:13).

The word here used means the <span class="accented">upper millstone</span>, which <span class="accented">rides</span> as it were, or moves, over the fixed nether stone. <span class="cmt_word">All to brake his skull</span>. This obsolete English phrase has been the subject of a recent controversy. In the older English of Chaucer and his immediate successors such compounds as <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> were very common, and were frequently preceded by the adverb <span class="accented">all.</span> Hence, some English scholars would read the phrase here, <span class="accented">and all to-brake his skull.</span> It is, however, certain that before the time when the A.V. was made the compounds <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> had become entirely obsolete, and the compound <span class="accented">all-to</span> had come into use. The right way, therefore, in which to read the present phrase <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="accented">and all-to brake his skull</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> smashed it, dashed it in pieces. The prefix <span class="accented">all-to</span> gives intensity to the verb. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:50-57 The Shechemites were ruined by Abimelech; now he is reckoned with, who was their leader in villany. Evil pursues sinners, and sometimes overtakes them, when not only at ease, but triumphant. Though wickedness may prosper a while, it will not prosper always. The history of mankind, if truly told, would greatly resemble that of this chapter. The records of what are called splendid events present to us such contests for power. Such scenes, though praised of men, fully explain the Scripture doctrine of the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the human heart, the force of men's lust, and the effect of Satan's influence. Lord, thou has given us thy word of truth and righteousness, O pour upon us thy spirit of purity, peace, and love, and write thy holy law in our hearts.</body></html>
