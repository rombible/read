Hence, though the terebinth is nowhere else mentioned by this particular name, it is at least a probable conjecture that it may be the ancient tree under which Jacob's family had buried their idolatrous amulets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gaal spake again</span>, etc. Of course, as the men got nearer, it was impossible to mistake them for anything but men.

Rather, <span class="accented">the oak</span> (or terebinth tree) <span class="accented">of the soothsayers</span>, some large terebinth or turpentine tree under which the soothsayers used to take their auguries.

When God uses men as instruments in his hand to do his work, he means one thing, and they another. That, which they hoped would have been for their welfare, proved a snare and a trap, as those will certainly find, who run to idols for shelter; such will prove a refuge of lies.</body></html>
