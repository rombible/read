The wine is said to cheer, or make to rejoice, God because the drink offering which accompanied the meat offering consisted of wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-7.htm">Numbers 15:7, 10</a>), and God was well pleased with the offerings of his people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>). The idea in this verse, as in vers. 9 and 11, is, that while the olive, the fig, and the vine were occupied in <span class="accented">waving</span> their branches over the other trees, in token of their superiority, they would necessarily be neglecting., their own proper gift and office, which was to produce oil, and figs, and grapes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:7-21 There was no occasion for the trees to choose a king, they are all the trees of the Lord which he has planted. Nor was there any occasion for Israel to set a king over them, for the Lord was their King. Those who bear fruit for the public good, are justly respected and honoured by all that are wise, more than those who merely make a figure. All these fruit-trees gave much the same reason for their refusal to be promoted over the trees; or, as the margin reads it, to go up and down for the trees. To rule, involves a man in a great deal both of toil and care. Those who are preferred to public trust and power, must forego all private interests and advantages, for the good of others. And those advanced to honour and dignity, are in great danger of losing their fruitfulness. For which reason, they that desire to do good, are afraid of being too great. Jotham compares Abimelech to the bramble or thistle, a worthless plant, whose end is to be burned. Such a one was Abimelech.</body></html>
