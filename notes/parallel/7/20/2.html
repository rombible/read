So, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-4.htm">Numbers 20:4</a>, Israel is called <span class="accented">the congregation of the Lord</span>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1</a>, <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">congregation of God.</span> Not dissimilar was the first great council of the Church, consisting of the Church (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the assembly of disciples) and the apostles and elders (who were the cornerstones, the <span class="accented">lapides angulares</span>, thereof). See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4, 6, 12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Four hundred thousand</span>. See ver. 17. The enumeration in the wilderness gave 603,550 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-32.htm">Numbers 2:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>), and at the second numbering 601,730 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-51.htm">Numbers 26:51</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-8.htm">1 Samuel 11:8</a> a general assembly of the whole people, summoned by sending a piece of the flesh of a yoke of oxen "throughout all the coasts of Israel," amounted to 330,000. David's numbering gave of Israel 800,000, and of Judah 500,000, in all 1,300,000; but these were not assembled together, but numbered at their own homes. Jehoshaphat's men of war amounted to 1,160,000 according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>. In the time of Amaziah there were of Judah alone 300,000 men able to go forth to war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-6.htm">2 Chronicles 24:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
