This is like the decision of the Amphictyonic counsel against the guilty city of Crissa (Grote, iv. 85). But perhaps it should be rendered "we will cast the lot upon it," to divide its territory when conquered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We will go up by lot against it</span>. The words <span class="accented">we will go up</span> are not in the Hebrew, but are supplied by the Septuagint, who very likely found in their Hebrew copy the word <span class="accented">na'aleh</span>, we will go up, which has since (perchance) fallen out of the Hebrew text from its resemblance to the following word '<span class="accented">aleha</span> against it. The sense will then be, Not one of us will shrink from the dangers of the war; but we will cast lots who shall go up against Gibeah, and who shall be employed in collecting victuals for the army, 40,000 having to be told off for the latter service. And exactly in the same spirit (if indeed the answer was not actually given by lot) they inquired of the Lord who should go up first (in ver. 18), and, we may presume also, who should follow in the subsequent attacks, though this is omitted for brevity. Others, however, think the words <span class="accented">against it by lot</span> are purposely abrupt, and that the meaning is that Israel would deal with Gibeah as they had done with the Canaanites, viz., destroy their city, and divide its territory by lot among the other tribes, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8-10</a>. But this interpretation is not borne out by what actually happened, nor is the phrase a likely one to have been used. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
