The LXX. and Luther make it mean "from Noria." Others render it "in their rest," i.e., in the places to which they fled for refuge. The Vulg. paraphrases it: "Nor was there any repose of the dying." But the whole verse is obscure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus they inclosed</span>, etc. Another difficult passage, having all the appearance of being a quotation from some poetical description of the battle. The tenses of the verbs and the absence of any conjunctions in the Hebrew makes the diction like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. The italic words <span class="accented">thus</span> and the two ands ought to be omitted, to give the stately march of the original. "They inclosed, etc.; they chased them; they trod them down," etc. <span class="accented">They inclosed</span> seems to refer to the stratagem by which the Benjamites were <span class="accented">surrounded</span> by the ambush in their rear and the Israelites in front. Then came the pursuit - "they chased them;" then the massacre - "they trod them down." The three verbs describe the three stages of the battle. <span class="cmt_word">With ease</span>. It does not seem possible that the Hebrew word <span class="accented">menuchah</span> can have this meaning. It means sometimes a <span class="accented">place of rest</span>, and sometimes <span class="accented">a state of rest.</span> Taking the latter meaning, the words <span class="accented">they trod them into rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">they quieted them by crushing them to death under their</span> feet, or <span class="accented">in rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">unresisting.</span> Some render it <span class="accented">unto Menuchah</span>, as if <span class="accented">Menuchah</span> was the name of a place, or <span class="accented">from Nochah</span>, as the Septuagint does. Others, <span class="accented">at the place of rest</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at every place where they halted to rest the enemy was upon them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
