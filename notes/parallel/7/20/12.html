We must suppose the message to have preceded in point of time the hostile gathering recorded in ver. 11. It was probably sent before the council broke up (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>, and note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.
