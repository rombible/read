Unless it be added by an anachronism, because it had become familiar when the Book of Judges was written, we should certainly infer from it that, early as were these events, they were subsequent to the migratory raid of the tribe of Dan to Laish.<p><span class= "bld">With the land of Gilead.</span>--The Trans-Jordanic tribes obeyed the summons, with the exception of the town of Jabesh-Gilead.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the Lord.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm" title="Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.">Judges 11:11</a>.

This Mizpeh is not the same as the one there mentioned, but is probably the bold hill and watch-tower now known as <span class= "ital">Neby Samwil, </span>and called Mountjoie by the Crusaders, from which the traveller gains his first glimpse of Jerusalem. In the Hebrew the name has the article, "the watch-tower." It was the scene of great gatherings of the tribes in the days of Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, while the ark stayed in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.">1Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1Samuel 10:17</a>) and of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2Chronicles 1:3</a>, probably), and even after the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-23.htm" title="And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.">2Kings 25:23</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> -  <span class="cmt_word">Went out</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from their several homes to the place of meeting. <span class="cmt_word">The congregation</span>. The technical term (not, however, found in Samuel and Kings, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>) for the whole Israelitish people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1, 2, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-15.htm">Leviticus 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">From Dan to Beersheba</span>. Dan, or Laish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>), being the northernmost point, and Beersheba (now <span class="accented">Bir-es-saba</span>, the springs so called) in the south of Judah the southernmost. It cannot be inferred with certainty from this expression that the Danite occupation of Laish had taken place at this time, though it may have done so, because we do not know when this narrative was written, and the phrase is only used as a proverbial expression familiar in the writer's time. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Gilead</span>. In its widest sense, meaning the whole of trans-Jordanic Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>, etc.). Mizpeh, or, as it is always written in Hebrew, <span class="accented">ham-Mizpeh</span>, with the article (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1</a>). The Mizpeh here mentioned is not the same as the Mizpeh of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11, 29, 34</a>, which was in Gilead, but was situated in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>). That it was a national place of meeting in the time of Samuel is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-12</a>, and we learn from ver. 16 of that same chapter that it was one of the places to which Samuel went on circuit. We find it a place of national meeting also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17</a>, and even so late as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-23.htm">2 Kings 25:23</a>, and in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 3:46). Its vicinity to Shiloh, where the tabernacle was, was probably one reason why it was made a centre to the whole congregation (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17, 22, 25</a>). Its exact site is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be that of <span class="accented">Nebi Samuil</span>, from which Jerusalem is seen at about two hours' distance to the south-east. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Lord</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the presence of the tabernacle, which was doubtless brought there, on so solemn an occasion, from Shiloh (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-34.htm">Exodus 34:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-2.htm">Judges 21:2</a>, and ver. 26 of this chapter). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
