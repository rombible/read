In the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Asked the Lord</span>, as in vers. 18, 23. <span class="cmt_word">For the ark of the covenant</span>, etc. A most important statement, defining the time of these occurrences, within the lifetime of Phinehas, and also giving a strong intimation that the writer of these words lived after the tabernacle had been removed from Shiloh and its neighbourhood to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Was there</span>. Where? The natural answer to be given is, At Bethel; for Bethel is the only place that has been named. But it is not in accordance with the other intimations given us concerning the tabernacle, that Bethel should be its resting-place under the high priesthood of Phinehas. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a> we have the formal pitching of the tabernacle of the congregation at Shiloh; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-12.htm">Joshua 22:12</a> we find it there, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest before it; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, we find it settled there till taken by the Philistines; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a> we find Shiloh described as the abode of the tabernacle till its capture by the Philistines, and there is no hint anywhere of Bethel or any other place having been the resting-place of the ark before it fell into the hands of the Philistines. Neither, again, is the explanation of some commentators, that the words <span class="accented">the ark</span>... <span class="accented">was there in those days</span> implies "that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel," at all satisfactory. <span class="accented">In those days</span> has naturally a much wider and broader application, like the expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), In <span class="accented">those days there was no king in Israel</span>, and contrasts the time of Phinehas and the judges with the times of the monarchy, when the ark and the high priest were at Jerusalem. Unless, therefore, we understand Bethel in vers. 18, 26, 31 to mean the house of God, which seems quite impossible, we must interpret the word <span class="accented">there</span> to mean Shiloh, and suppose that the writer took no count of the temporary removal to Bethel for the convenience of consultation, but considered that it was at Shiloh in one sense, though momentarily it was a few miles off. Possibly too in the fuller narrative, of which we have here the abridgment, the name of Shiloh was mentioned as that to which there referred. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
