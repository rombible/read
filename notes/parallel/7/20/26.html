The distinction between the two was that the burnt offerings typified absolute self-dedication, whereas the peace offerings were mainly eucharistic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then all the children of Israel, and all the people</span>, etc. Observe the word <span class="accented">all</span>, twice repeated, as showing how the whole congregation was roused and stirred to a man by this second reverse. <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">people</span>, as distinguished from <span class="accented">the men of Israel</span>, the army, probably means the non-fighting people, the aged, the infirm, women, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The house of God</span>.

The usual time for terminating a fast among the Jews, as at the present day among Mahomedans.

Usually thank offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11, 12</a>), but applicable to any voluntary sacrifice of which the flesh might be eaten the same day, or the day following, by the offerer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15, 16</a>). Doubtless the people at the close of their fast ate the flesh of these peace offerings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
