In this feigned flight thirty Israelites were killed. "Gibeah in the field" seems to be Jeba, and the main road from Gibeah (<span class= "ital">Tuleil el F-l</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>at about a mile's distance from the hill, branches off into two, of which one leads to Beitin (Bethel), and the other to Jeba ("Gibeah in the field").<p><span class= "bld">The highways.</span>--(<span class= "ital">Mesilloth.</span>) Roads like the Roman <span class= "ital">viae regiae, </span>regularly built.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of God</span>.

The A.V. is the natural rendering of the Hebrew words, which imply a <span class="accented">Gibeah in the field</span> different from <span class="accented">Gibeah</span>, as the Septuagint seems to have understood them (<span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>). It is a happy conjecture, borne out by the existing roads, that this Gibeah-in-the-field is the same as <span class="accented">Gobs</span>, now <span class="accented">Jeba.</span> Indeed it is almost impossible to conceive how the pursuers, coming out of Gibeah, could be described as coming to two highways, of which one led to Bethel and the other to the very place they had come from. The latest explorers of the district fully concur in this identification of Gibeah-in-the-field with Jeba. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
