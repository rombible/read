and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.">Joshua 18:12</a>). It is described in Joshua 16 as "the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel." (See Robinson, <span class= "ital">Bibl. Res. </span>1:572.) The first thought of fugitives in Eastern Palestine was to get to one of the fords of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm" title="And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.">2Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2Kings 25:4-5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</span>--This obscure clause is rendered differently in different versions. If the English Version be correct, as it probably is, the meaning must be that the Benjamites fled to their own cities, and were pursued thither and slain by the Israelites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they turned their backs</span>, etc. The narrative now at length advances one step. The result of the Benjamites finding themselves between the ambushment and the army of Israel was that they took to flight in an easterly direction (ver. 43) toward the wilderness, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wilderness described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a> as "the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel," where the direction of the wilderness relative to Ephraim is also described as being "on the east." In like manner Zedekiah fled towards the plain (<span class="accented">arabah</span>) or plains of Jericho - a term nearly synonymous with <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Them which came out of the cities</span>, etc. This is a very obscure passage, and is very variously explained. <span class="accented">Those which came out</span> of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">cities</span> must be the same as are so described in ver. 15, and designates the Benjamites who were not inhabitants of Gibeah. The simplest way, therefore, to understand the passage is to render it without reference to the accents: "And the battle overtook him and those that were from the cities (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Gibeah and the rest of the Benjamites), destroying him (the whole Benjamite army) in the midst of him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> going right into the midst of them, and destroying right and left. Some, however, render it <span class="accented">in the midst of it</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the wilderness. The plural participle <span class="accented">destroying</span> agrees with the singular noun of multitude, <span class="accented">the battle</span> or <span class="accented">war</span>, meaning <span class="accented">all the men of war.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
