Not of course after 25,000 of them had been smitten, but at that period of the battle more fully described in vers. 40, 41, when the Benjamites, looking behind them, saw Gibeah in flames, and immediately broke and fled towards the wilderness. In the latter half of this verse and in the following verses to ver. 41 the writer recapitulates all the preceding circumstances, some of which have been already mentioned, which led to the particular incident mentioned in the beginning of the verse, that "Benjamin saw that they were smitten;" viz., the feigned flight of the Israelites, the seizing and burning of Gibeah by the liers in wait, the signal of a great smoke, and the turning again of the flying Israelites. It was then that "the men of Benjamin saw that evil was come upon them," and turned their backs and fled. Thus vers. 36 (latter half)-41 bring us back through the details to the identical point already reached at the beginning of ver. 36. In vers. 39, 40 there is another retrograde movement in the narrative, in which the statement of vers. 31, 32 is repeated in order to bring into close juxtaposition Benjamin's keen pursuit of the enemy with his terror when he saw the smoke rising in his rear. <span class="cmt_word">Hasted</span> (ver. 37). This is an amplification with further particulars of ver. 33. The liers in wait not only came forth out of their place, but they made a dash to get into Gibeah before the men of Gibeah, who were pursuing the flying Israelites, could be aware of their intention. <span class="cmt_word">Rushed upon</span>. Perhaps better rendered <span class="accented">fell upon</span>. It is exactly the same phrase as 2 Samuel 27:8, there rather tamely rendered in<span class="accented">vaded</span> and in ver. 10 <span class="accented">made a road</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Drew themselves</span> <span class="cmt_word">along</span>. Some take the word in the common sense of <span class="accented">blowing the trumpet</span>, but it rather <span class="accented">means</span> spread <span class="accented">themselves out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7a;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.) through the defenceless city, so as to slay and burn in all parts simultaneously. <span class="cmt_word">That they should make a great flame with smoke,</span> etc. (ver. 38). The Hebrew of this verse is difficult to construe, but the A.V. gives substantially the right sense. They seem to be the very orders given to the leader of the ambush. "Make them (the ambush) multiply to send up (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> send up in great quantities) the column of smoke from the city." It seems that the appearance of the smoke was the signal for the Israelites to turn (ver. 41). <span class="cmt_word">The flame</span>, etc. (ver. 40). Rather, <span class="accented">the column began to go up in</span> (or as) <span class="accented">a pillar of smoke. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The flame of the city</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">the whole of the city</span>, meaning of course the whole city in flames. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
