Bochart's attempt (<span class= "ital">Hieroz. </span>Ii. 162) to explain it by a passage in <span class= "ital">Quintus Smyrn?us, </span>which says that archers used to contend which should be able to shoot off the horsehair crest of a helmet, is a mere specimen of learning fantastically misapplied. Skill with the sling was not confined to the Benjamites, as we see from the case of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-49.htm" title="And David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.">1Samuel 17:49</a>). The sling is the natural weapon of a people which is poor and imperfectly armed. Cyrus valued his force of 400 slingers (Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. iii.</span> 3-6). The inhabitants of the Balearic Isles were as skilful as the Benjamites, and children were trained to sling their breakfasts down from the top of high poles. They once prevented the Carthaginian fleet from coming to anchor by showers of stones (liv. xxviii. 37, <span class= "ital">solo eo telo utebantur</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Practice made them so expert that the stones they slung came with as much force as though hurled by a catapult, and pierced shields and helmets (Diod. Sic. <span class= "ital">Bibl. </span>v. 18). Exactly similar tales are told of the trained skill of our English archers. The advantage of slinging with the <span class= "ital">left </span>hand was very obvious, for it enabled the slinger to strike his enemy on the <span class= "ital">right, i.e., </span>the undefended side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven hundred... men left-handed</span>. It is curious that the tribe of Benjamin, which means <span class="accented">son of the right hand</span>, should have this peculiar institution of a corps of left-handed men. Ehud the Benjamite was <span class="accented">a man left-handed</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). The Roman name <span class="accented">Scaexola</span> means <span class="accented">left-handed.</span> For the use of the sling see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40, 49</a>. Diodorus Siculus (quoted by Rosenmuller) mentions the remarkable skill of the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands in the use of the sling, adding, in terms very similar to those of the text, that they seldom miss their aim. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
