The reason why our translators adopted their translation is shown by the Vulgate, which renders it "to the house of God <span class= "ital">that is in Shiloh." </span>But <span class= "ital">Beth El </span>cannot mean "house of God," which is always either <span class= "ital">Beth ha-Elohim </span>or <span class= "ital">Beth Adonai </span>(house of the Lord). Why they did not meet at the more central Shiloh we cannot say.<p><span class= "bld">Asked counsel of God.</span>--Namely, by the Urim and Thummim. Apparently the high priest was not prevented by any scruple from taking the ephod, with its jewelled breastplate and Urim and Thummim, to any place where its use was needed. The ark was similarly carried from place to place, and had been brought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm" title="And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,">Judges 20:27</a>) to the venerable sanctuary of Bethel with the high priest. It is not necessary to suppose that the tabernacle was itself removed. It <span class= "ital">may </span>have been--for Shiloh was never understood to be more than its temporary resting-place. Bethel--as being a sacred place and near Gibeah--would be a convenient place of rendezvous.<p><span class= "bld">Which of us . . .?</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1-2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Judah . . . first.</span>--This is remarkable as indicating that the Urim and Thummim were something more than a pair of lots, and that the questions with which God was consulted by its means were other than those which admitted a mere positive or negative answer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of God</span>. In this rendering the A.V. follows the Vulgate, which <span class="accented">has in demure Dei</span>, <span class="accented">hoc est</span>, <span class="accented">in Silo.</span> But the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>, and all the ancient authorities, as well as modern commentators, generally agree in rendering it <span class="accented">Bethel.</span> The reason, which seems a conclusive one, for so doing is that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> invariably means Bethel, and that <span class="accented">the house of God</span> is always expressed in Hebrew by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">beth-ha-elohim</span>). The conclusion is that at this time the ark of God, with the tabernacle, was at Bethel, which was only seven or eight miles from Shiloh. Bethel would be eight or ten miles from Gibeah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about half way between Shiloh and Gibeah. <span class="cmt_word">Asked counsel</span>. The same phrase as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, where it is rendered simply asked (see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, and vers. 23, 47). In following this precedent the Israelites put the men of Gibeah on the footing of the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. With reference to ver. 9, it is worth considering whether this is not the fulfilment of the purpose there expressed by the Israelites, to go up against Gibeah <span class="accented">by lot</span>; either by understanding that the answer asked was given by a Divinely-directed <span class="accented">lot</span>, according to which Judah's turn came first (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24-26</a>; etc.), or by taking the expression <span class="accented">by lot</span> in a wider sense, as meaning generally Divine direction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
