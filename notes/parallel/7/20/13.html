That they should have preferred an internecine civil war to the giving up their criminals illustrates the peculiarly fierce character of the tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-27.htm" title="Benjamin shall shred as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.">Genesis 49:27</a>).

Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
