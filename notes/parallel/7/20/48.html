The dreadful meaning which lies beyond these short and simple words is <span class= "ital">the absolute extermination of </span>a whole tribe of Israel, MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, CITIES AND CATTLE, with the exception of 600 fugitives. There is something almost inconceivably horrible and appalling in the thought of thousands of poor women and innocent children ruthlessly butchered in cold blood in this internecine war between brother Israelites. The whole tribe were placed under the ban of extirpation, as though they had been Canaanites, just as mercilessly as Sihon and his people had been extirpated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm" title="And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:">Deuteronomy 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-15.htm" title="You shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.">Deuteronomy 13:15-16</a>), or Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm" title="And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.">Joshua 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-21.htm" title="And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.">Joshua 6:21</a>), or Ai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/8-25.htm" title="And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.">Joshua 8:25-26</a>). Their feelings were doubtless exasperated by the fearful destruction which Benjamin had inflicted upon them, as well as by religious horror at the conduct of the tribe; and for the rest, we can only say that <span class= "ital">"</span>the times of this ignorance God winked at." The good side of the deed lies in its motive: it expressed an intense horror against moral pollution. The evil side lay in its ruthless savagery. In both aspects it agrees both with the recorded and the traditional character of Phinehas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm" title="And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.">Numbers 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-6.htm" title="And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.">Numbers 31:6</a>). (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man.

Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
