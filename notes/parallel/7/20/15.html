Josephus, however (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, ? 10), has 25,000, as also has Codex A of theLXX., and Codex B has 23,000 (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-46.htm" title="So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.">Judges 20:46</a>). We see generally that the Benjamites, like the rest of the Israelites, in spite of their exceptional increase in the wilderness, had been now diminished by about a third since the last census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-41.htm" title="These are the sons of Benjamin after their families: and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six hundred.">Numbers 26:41</a>). (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-2.htm" title="And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.">Judges 20:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Seven hundred chosen men.</span>--There seems to be some uncertainty or confusion in the text here. It is difficult to imagine that, as the text stands, the single city of Gibeah furnished to the Benjamites their one choice contingent of seven hundred slingers, and it would be a curious coincidence that the force of Gibeah and the slingers should each be exactly seven hundred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and six thousand</span>. The numbers of Benjamin in the wilderness were at the first numbering 35,400, and at the second 45,600 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-36.htm">Numbers 1:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-23.htm">Numbers 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-41.htm">Numbers 26:41</a>). It is impossible to account with certainty for the falling off in the numbers by so many as near 20,000; but perhaps many were slain in the wars of Canaan, and the unsettled times were unfavourable to early marriages. For the whole of Israel there was, as appeared by ver. 2, note, a falling off of nearly 200,000 men, or, to speak exactly (601,730-400,000 +26,700), of 175,030. <span class="cmt_word">Which were numbered</span>. There is some obscurity in this latter clause; but, in spite of the accents being opposed to it, the A.V. seems certainly right. The rendering acording to the accents, "they (the Benjamites) were numbered, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, seven hundred chosen men," makes no sense, and does not explain who the 700 were. The population of Gibeah would be about 5 &times; 700, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 3500, according to this statement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</body></html>
