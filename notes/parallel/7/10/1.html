Abimelech is not counted among the judges, though it is not improbable that, evil as was the episode of his rebellions, he may have kept foreign enemies in check.<p><span class= "bld">To defend Israel.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">to deliver, </span>as in the margin and elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-16.htm" title="Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.">Judges 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm" title="And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.">Judges 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>, &c).<p><span class= "bld">There arose.</span>--The phrase implies a less direct call and a less immediate service than that used of other judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm" title="And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.">Judges 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Tola.</span>--The name of a son of Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-13.htm" title="And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.">Genesis 46:13</a>) It means "worm" (perhaps the <span class= "ital">kermes </span>-worm), and may, like Puah, be connected with the trade in purple dyes. He seems to have been the only judge furnished by this indolent tribe, unless Deborah be an exception. Josephus omits his name.<p><span class= "bld">Puah.</span>--Also a son of Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-1.htm" title="Now the sons of Issachar were, Tola, and Puah, Jashub, and Shimrom, four.">1Chronicles 7:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The son of Dodo.</span>--The LXX. render it "the son of his uncle," but there can be little doubt that Dodo is a proper name, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-12.htm" title="And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.">1Chronicles 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:">2Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm" title="Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,">2Samuel 23:24</a>. It is from the same root as David, "beloved." Since Tola was of Issachar, he could not be nephew of Abimelech a Manassite.<p><span class= "bld">He dwelt in Shamir.</span>--The name has nothing to do with Samaria, as the LXX. seem to suppose.

There was another Shamir in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm" title="And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,">Joshua 15:48</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo</span>. Nothing more is known of Tola than what is here told us, viz., his name, his parentage, his dwelling-place, his office, the length of time which he held it, and the place of his burial. Who were the enemies from whom Tola was raised up to save Israel we are not told. There was probably no great invasion or grievous servitude, but perhaps frequent border wars requiring an able and watchful chief to maintain the independence of Israel. Tola and Puah (otherwise written Puvah) were both names of families in Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-13.htm">Genesis 46:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shamir in mount Ephraim</span>, to distinguish it from <span class="accented">Shamir in</span> the hill country of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>).
