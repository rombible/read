This earlier Jair, with Nobah, plays a splendid part in Jewish legend, which is only alluded to in Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>). In what relation the Jair of these verses stood to him we cannot, in the uncertain data of the chronology, decide. The Jair of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm" title="And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.">Numbers 32:41</a> was descended from Judah on the father's side, and on the mother's was a great-grandson of Manasseh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jair</span>. We read of Jair the son of Segub, the son of Machir's daughter by Hezron, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21-23</a>, and are there told that he had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead (called Havoth-jair), which were included in the territory of the sons of Machir. The same information is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40-42</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14, 15</a>, in both which passages Jair is styled the son of Manasseh, and is stated to have called the cities after his own name, Havoth-jair. In the present verse we are also told that Jair the judge was a Gileadite, and that he had thirty sons who had thirty cities in Gilead called Havoth-jair. The question arises, Can these two be the same person? If they are, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> must be a later parenthetical insertion, as it has very much the appearance of being. The notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a> must also refer to later times than those of Moses, and we must understand the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, that "Segub begat Jair," as meaning that he was his lineal ancestor, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8</a> we read that "Joram begat Ozias," though three generations intervened between them. If, on the other hand, they are not the same, we must suppose that Jair in our text was a descendant of the other Jair, and may compare the double explanation of the name Havoth-jair with the double explanation of <span class="accented">Beer-sheba</span> given <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-31.htm">Genesis 26:31-33</a>; the threefold explanation of the name Isaac, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>; and the double explanation of the proverb, "Is Saul among the prophets?" given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>.
