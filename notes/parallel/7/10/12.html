and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.">Judges 18:7-28</a>. Nothing very definite is recorded of deliverance from the Sidonians; but (as we have seen) the narrative of the book is typical rather than exhaustive. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/106-42.htm" title="Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.">Psalm 106:42-43</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The Amalekites.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm" title="Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.">Exodus 17:8</a>, Exod. 6:33, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-13.htm" title="And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say to them?">Exodus 3:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The Maonites.</span>--As the LXX. here read <span class= "ital">Madian </span>(and in some MSS. <span class= "ital">Canaan; </span>Vulg., <span class= "ital">Chanaan</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>it seems probable that there has been an early corruption of the text. In the Arabic version we have "Moabites." There was a town Maon in the desert of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm" title="Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,">Joshua 15:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-24.htm" title="And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.">1Samuel 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm" title="And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.">1Samuel 25:2</a>), but this cannot be meant. There is also a Beth Meon in the tribe of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-38.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, See, I am come to you: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.">Numbers 22:38</a>; Baal Meon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-23.htm" title="And on Kiriathaim, and on Bethgamul, and on Bethmeon,">Jeremiah 48:23</a>), and a Meon in Arabia Petraea. <span class= "ital">Mehunims </span>are also mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm" title="And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelled in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.">2Chronicles 26:7</a>, and Meonim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm" title="And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and dwelled in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.">1Chronicles 4:41</a>. If this is an allusion to some disaster of which we have no record given we must suppose that Meon was once the capital of some tribe which subsequently dwindled into insignificance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Zidonians also</span>. This allusion is not clear; it may mean the subjects of Jabin king of Canaan, as the northern Canaanites are called <span class="accented">Zidonians</span> in ch. 18:7; and this agrees with the order in which the deliverance from the Zidonians is here mentioned, next to that from the Philistines, and would be strengthened by the conjecture that has been made, that Harosheth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>) was the great workshop in which the tributary Israelites wrought in cutting down timber, etc. for the Phoenician ships; or it may allude to some unrecorded oppression. <span class="cmt_word">The Amalekites</span>, who were in alliance with the Midianites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3, 33</a>), as previously with the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>) and with the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>), and whose signal defeat seems to have given the name to the mount of the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-15.htm">Judges 12:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Maonites</span>. It is thought by many that the true reading is that preserved in the Septuagint, viz., <span class="accented">the Midianites</span>, which, being the greatest of all the foes of Israel, could scarcely be omitted here (see chs. 6, 7, 8.). If <span class="accented">Maonites</span> or <span class="accented">Maon</span> is the true reading, they would be the same people as the <span class="accented">Mehunim</span>, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a> (<span class="accented">Maon</span>, sing., and <span class="accented">Meunim</span>, plur.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 God is able to multiply men's punishments according to the numbers of their sins and idols. But there is hope when sinners cry to the Lord for help, and lament their ungodliness as well as their more open transgressions. It is necessary, in true repentance, that there be a full conviction that those things cannot help us which we have set in competition with God. They acknowledged what they deserved, yet prayed to God not to deal with them according to their deserts. We must submit to God's justice, with a hope in his mercy. True repentance is not only for sin, but from sin. As the disobedience and misery of a child are a grief to a tender father, so the provocations of God's people are a grief to him. From him mercy never can be sought in vain. Let then the trembling sinner, and the almost despairing backslider, cease from debating about God's secret purposes, or from expecting to find hope from former experiences. Let them cast themselves on the mercy of God our Saviour, humble themselves under his hand, seek deliverance from the powers of darkness, separate themselves from sin, and from occasions of it, use the means of grace diligently, and wait the Lord's time, and so they shall certainly rejoice in his mercy.</body></html>
