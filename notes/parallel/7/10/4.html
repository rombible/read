Implying that Jair was able to bring up his numerous household in wealth. The horse was little used in Palestine--for which, indeed, it is little suited--till the days of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-26.htm" title="And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.">1Kings 4:26</a>), and its introduction was always discouraged by the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/11-6.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: you shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-17.htm" title="An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.">Psalm 33:17</a>, &c). There is a curious play of words on Jair (<span class= "ital">yair</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>"ass-colts" (<span class= "ital">ay?rim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and "cities," which ought to be <span class= "ital">arim, </span>but is purposely altered for the sake of the paronomasia. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-16.htm" title="And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps on heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.">Judges 15:16</a>.) Such plays on words in serious narratives point to a very early form of literature--but probably they then rose from some popular proverb. The LXX., like Josephus, writing for Gentiles, who did not understand the value attached to asses in Palestine, almost always euphemise the word into "colts," or "foals" (<span class= "ital">p?lous</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which here enables them happily to keep up the play of words with "cities" (<span class= "ital">poleis</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair.</span>--Havoth means villages (LXX., <span class= "ital">epauleis</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and since they are here called "cities," and <span class= "ital">thirty </span>are named, we must suppose that this Jair (if he was a different person from the other) had increased the number of the villages originally wrested from Og from twenty-three to thirty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm" title="And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm" title="And Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of Gilead.">1Chronicles 2:22</a>. In the latter passage the Jair there mentioned is spoken of as a son of Segub, and a <span class= "ital">great-grandson </span>of Manasseh).<p><span class= "bld">Unto this day.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-26.htm" title="And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof to this day.">Judges 1:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty ass colts</span>. The number and dignity of these knightly sons of Jair shows that Jair himself, like Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30</a>), assumed the state of a prince. The word in Hebrew for ass <span class="accented">colts is</span> identical with that for <span class="accented">cities</span>, as here pointed, and this play upon the words belongs to the same turn of mind as produced Jotham s fable and Samson's riddle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-14.htm">Judges 14:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Quiet and peaceable reigns, though the best to live in, yield least variety of matter to be spoken of. Such were the days of Tola and Jair. They were humble, active, and useful men, rulers appointed of God.</body></html>
