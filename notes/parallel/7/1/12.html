Caleb was a "Kenizzite," which seems to imply that he was descended from Kenaz, a grandson of Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-11.htm" title="And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.">Genesis 36:11</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-6.htm" title="Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.">Numbers 13:6</a> he is mentioned as being a prince (<span class= "ital">nasi, </span>or chief, <span class= "ital">rosh</span>) of the tribe of Judah. He was certainly affiliated to that tribe; but if the name "Caleb" means "dog," it would seem a very unlikely name for a pure Jew, for I cannot think that the effort to trace a sort of <span class= "ital">totem </span>system (or naming of tribes from animals) among the ancient Jews (<span class= "ital">Journ. of Philology, </span>June, 1880) is successful. His father's name. Je-phunneh, is of uncertain derivation. Frst and Meier derive Caleb from a root meaning "valiant;" but the peculiarity of the expressions used respecting him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm" title="And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.">Joshua 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-14.htm" title="Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.">Joshua 14:14</a>, together with certain marked names and features in the genealogies of his family, at least give some probability to the conjecture that he was of foreign origin.<p><span class= "bld">Will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.">1Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.">1Samuel 18:17</a>. So the Messenian hero Aristomenes gave a peasant woman, who had saved his life, in marriage to his son. This story shows the strength and importance of this fastness of the south, which is also proved by the fact that Caleb has to refer to his unbroken strength before he gains permission to win the region by the sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-11.htm" title="As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.">Joshua 14:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-20 The Canaanites had iron chariots; but Israel had God on their side, whose chariots are thousands of angels, Ps 68:17. Yet they suffered their fears to prevail against their faith. About Caleb we read in Jos 15:16-19. The Kenites had settled in the land. Israel let them fix where they pleased, being a quiet, contented people. They that molested none, were molested by none. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</body></html>
