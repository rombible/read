R. Tanchum makes it mean "very strong chariots;" but the phrase means either "chariots with iron-bound wheels," or "<span class= "ital">scythed </span>chariots." Ktesias attributes scythed chariots to Ninus, but none are seen on the Nineveh sculptures, and it is doubtful whether they were known so early. Xenophon says that scythed chariots were invented by Cyrus, which would not be till five centuries after this period. For this clause the LXX. have," because Rechab resisted them," mistaking <span class= "ital">rekeb, "</span>chariot," for a proper name (as they often do with other words). Hence the notion of Theodoret that the Kenites, to which Rechab belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2Kings 10:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-2.htm" title="Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.">Jeremiah 35:2</a>), secretly helped the Philistines, is quite groundless. We see a reason for the partial failure of the Israelites in the fact that at this time they had not attained to the same level of civilisation as the Canaanites in arts and arms. This advantage could only have been rendered unavailing by more faith and faithfulness than they showed in their conduct. "Their warriors often rather overran than subdued the land. . . . The chariots and better arms of the Canaanites rendered the conquest of the valleys and plains long and laborious, especially to Joseph, Judah, and Dan. . . . The Hebrews 'walked upon the high places of the land' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-33.htm" title="He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places.">Psalm 18:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-34.htm" title="He makes my feet like hinds' feet: and sets me on my high places.">2Samuel 22:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm" title="The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk on my high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.">Habakkuk 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-14.htm" title="Then shall you delight yourself in the LORD; and I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth, and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 58:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm" title="He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-29.htm" title="O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!">Deuteronomy 32:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm" title="Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>); but these heights were often encompassed like islands by the inhabitants of the valleys" (Ewald, ii. 264).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Chariots of iron</span>. The chariots of the Canaanites were very formidable to the Israelites, who had no means of coping with them. Thus we are told of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazer, that he had 900 chariots of iron, and mightily oppressed the children of Israel. They were later an important part of King Solomon's army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). See too <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-20 The Canaanites had iron chariots; but Israel had God on their side, whose chariots are thousands of angels, Ps 68:17. Yet they suffered their fears to prevail against their faith. About Caleb we read in Jos 15:16-19. The Kenites had settled in the land. Israel let them fix where they pleased, being a quiet, contented people. They that molested none, were molested by none. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</body></html>
