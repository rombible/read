If the view taken as to the chronology of this chapter is correct, this assault is identical with those touched upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm" title="And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.">Joshua 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/15-13.htm" title="And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.">Joshua 15:13-14</a>. The LXX. have, "Hebron came forth against Judah." For later references to Hebron, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-25.htm" title="And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelled at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages thereof,">Nehemiah 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/5-65.htm" title="Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward the south, where he smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down the fortress of it, and burned the towers thereof round about.">1 Maccabees 5:65</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Kirjath-arba.</span>--That is, "the <span class= "ital">city </span>of Arba." The word afterwards became archaic and poetical (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm" title="Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.">Psalm 48:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm" title="For you have made of a city an heap; of a defended city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.">Isaiah 25:2</a>). All the cities thus named (Kir-jath-huzoth, Kirjath-jearim, &c.) existed <span class= "ital">before </span>the conquest of Palestine. We find the root in Iskariot (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>man of Kerioth, a town in the south of Judah). Arba was the father of Anak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm" title="And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.">Joshua 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-15.htm" title="And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.">Joshua 14:15</a>), and Frst interprets the name "hero of Baal." Some, however, take Arba for the numeral "four," so that Kirjath-arba would mean Tetrapolis; and connect the name Hebron with the Arabic "<span class= "ital">Cherbar," </span>a confederation, "the <span class= "ital">cities </span>of Hebron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-3.htm" title="And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelled in the cities of Hebron.">2Samuel 2:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Sheshai, and Animan, and Talmai.</span>--Possibly the names of three <span class= "ital">clans </span>of the Anakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/13-22.htm" title="And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)">Numbers 13:22-23</a>). The Anakim are connected with the Nephilim--giant races sprung from the union of the sons of God with the daughters of men. Josephus says that giant bones of the race were shown in his day (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, ? 3). They were doubtless the bones of extinct animals, and being taken for human remains might well lead to the conclusion of Josephus, that these giants "had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-19</a>. Hebron was the burial-place of Abraham and Sarah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>, etc.; Genesis 25:9), of Isaac and Rebekah, and of Jacob and Leah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-31.htm">Genesis 49:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13</a>), and the mosque, within whose massive walls the tombs of Abraham and the other four above mentioned are still preserved with the utmost reverence, is the most remarkable object in the modern city, which is called <span class="accented">El-Khalil</span> (the friend), after Abraham, the <span class="accented">friend of</span> God. A very interesting account of the Prince of Wales's visit to the Mosque of Hebron in 1862 is given in Dean Stanley s 'Sermons in the East.' David reigned in Hebron seven years and six mouths before he transferred the seat of power to Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>, etc.; 2 Samuel 5:1-5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-20 The Canaanites had iron chariots; but Israel had God on their side, whose chariots are thousands of angels, Ps 68:17. Yet they suffered their fears to prevail against their faith. About Caleb we read in Jos 15:16-19. The Kenites had settled in the land. Israel let them fix where they pleased, being a quiet, contented people. They that molested none, were molested by none. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</body></html>
