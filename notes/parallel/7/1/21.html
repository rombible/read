Jerusalem is a remarkable exception to the rule that the Israelites conquered "the hill-country," but not the plain.<p><span class= "bld">Unto this day.</span>--The assignment of Jerusalem to Benjamin shows that <span class= "ital">this </span>narrative, though not contemporaneous, is older than the conquest of Jerusalem by David.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - This verse is identical with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>, except that there we read "the children of Judah" instead of "the children of Benjamin," as in this verse. The boundary line between Judah and Jerusalem passed through JEBUS or JEBUSI, as Jerusalem was anciently called (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4, 5</a>). Jebus was not finally held by the Israelites till the time of David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10</a>, note.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-36 The people of Israel were very careless of their duty and interest. Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains to complete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: they were willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they might make advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation of idolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the full possession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprived them of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many a believer who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lusts revive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recovers its hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart, discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he may have sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet he will have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; and upon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying God and serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with the enemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore our only wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.</body></html>
