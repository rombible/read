The "seventy" kings may have been the rulers of the towns which Adoni-bezek had taken in extending the territory of Bezek. Josephus says seventy-two kings (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, ? 2), and this common variation is found in some MSS. of the LXX. The Persians treated their Greek captives in this way (Curtius, v. 5,6). Mutilation in the East was so common that it was hardly accounted cruel (Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. i.</span> 9-13). Cutting off the hand or foot was the prescribed Mohammedan punishment for theft in British India (Mill, iii. 447), and many mutilated persons are still to be seen in Northern Scinde (see Grote's <span class= "ital">Greece, </span>xii. 235).<p><span class= "bld">Gathered their meat under my table.</span>--The words "their meat" are wanting in the original. Adoni-bezek, with cruel insolence, treated these subject Sheykhs like dogs "which eat of the fragments that fall from the table of their lords" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>). Posidonius says that the king of Parthia used to fling food to his courtiers, who seized it like dogs (Athen. 4:152). The existence of these feuds among the Canaanites would render the task of the Israelites more easy.<p><span class= "bld">As I have done, so God hath requited me.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm" title="And he said, They were my brothers, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you.">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:33</a>, "As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-11.htm" title="Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Know you not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.">Judges 15:11</a>, "As they (the Philistines) did unto me, so have 1 (Samson) done unto them;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-56.htm" title="Because the spoiler is come on her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite.">Jeremiah 51:56</a>, "The Lord God of recompences shall surely requite thee;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-11.htm" title="Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.">Exodus 18:11</a>, "For the thing wherein they sinned came upon them." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-2.htm" title="For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.">Matthew 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm" title="For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.">James 2:13</a>.) The word used for God is <span class= "ital">Elohim. </span>In Greek theology this punishment of like by like is called "the retribution of Neoptolemus," who murdered Priam at an altar, and was himself murdered at an altar (Pausan. v. 17, 3). The fate of Phalaris, burnt in his own brazen bull (Ovid, <span class= "ital">De Art. Am. </span>i. 653), and of Dionysius ('lian, <span class= "ital">Var. Hist. ix.</span> 8), were also prominent illustrations of the law. We must not suppose that this Canaanite prince worshipped Jehovah, but only that he recognised generally that a Divine retribution had overtaken him. It is one of the commonest facts of history that<p>"Even-handed justice<p>Commends the ingredients of the poisoned chalice<p>To our own lips."<p>This truth, "that wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished," is magnificently, if somewhat fancifully, worked out in Wisdom 11, 17, 18<p><span class= "bld">They brought him to Jerusalem.</span>--Rabbi Tanchum, author of the celebrated traditional Midrash (or "exposition"), says that this notice must <span class= "ital">be prospective, i.e., </span>it must refer to a time subsequent to the conquest of Jerusalem mentioned in the next verse. It may, however, merely mean that they kept him with them in their camp when they advanced to the siege of Jerusalem; or the "<span class= "ital">they</span>" may refer to his own people. The Israelites may have contemptuously spared his life, and suffered him to join his own people, as a living monument of God's vengeance. In any case the name Jerusalem is used by anticipation, for it seems to have been called Jebus till the days of David. As it is also called Jebusi (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"the Jebusite") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>, probably the name of the town comes from that of the tribe, and the derivation of it is unknown. The meaning "dry" suggested by Ewald is very uncertain.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 The Israelites were convinced that the war against the Canaanites was to be continued; but they were in doubt as to the manner in which it was to be carried on after the death of Joshua. In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.</body></html>
