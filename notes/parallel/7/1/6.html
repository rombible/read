Romans who desired to escape conscription cut off their thumbs (Suet. <span class= "ital">Aug. </span>24). The cutting off of his great toes would deprive him of that speed which was so essential for an ancient warrior, that "swift-footed" is in Homer the normal epithet of Achilles. Either of these mutilations would be sufficient to rob him of his throne, since ancient races never tolerated a king who had any personal defects. This kind of punishment was not uncommon in ancient days, and it was with the same general object that the Athenians inflicted it on the conquered 'ginetans. Mohammed (Koran, <span class= "ital">Sur. </span>8:12) ordered the enemies of Islam to be thus punished; and it used to be the ancient German method of punishing poachers ('lian, <span class= "ital">Var. Hist. ii.</span> 9). The peculiar appropriateness of the punishment in this instance arose from the <span class= "ital">Lex talionis, </span>or "law of equivalent punishment," which Moses had tolerated as the best means to limit the intensity of those blood-feuds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-19.htm" title="And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him;">Leviticus 24:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm" title="And your eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/15-10.htm" title="And the men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us?

In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.</body></html>
