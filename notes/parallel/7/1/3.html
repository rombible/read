It was natural that the two tribes should help one another, because their lots were conterminous; indeed, the lot of the Simeonites is said to lie "<span class= "ital">within </span>the inheritance of the children of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.">Joshua 19:1</a>), and was given them "out of the portion of the children of Judah" (<span class= "ital">ib., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm" title="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Judges 1:9</a>), because a larger territory had been assigned to the tribe of Judah than it required. The tribe of Simeon was remarkable for its fierce valour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/4-24.htm" title="The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul:">1Chronicles 4:24-43</a>), of which we find a trace even in Judith, who belonged to that tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/judith/9-2.htm" title="O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword to take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted her virginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yet they did so:">Judith 9:2</a>). It would, however, have been helpless without the assistance of Judah; for we see from a comparison of the first with the second census in the Desert that Simeon had decreased in strength from 59,300 to 22,200. This fearful diminution seems to have been due to the plague, which may have fallen most heavily on them from their greater guilt, as we may infer from the shamelessness of their prince Zimri (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm" title="Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.">Numbers 25:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-23.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.">Numbers 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-14.htm" title="These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 26:14</a>). Hence the tribe is omitted in the blessing of Moses (Deuteronomy 33). They seem to have melted away among the nomad tribes of the south, but we see them showing a last flash of vitality in the days of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm" title="And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and dwelled in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.">1Chronicles 4:41</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Into my lot</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>into the territory assigned me by lot ("Croesus devasted the <span class= "ital">lots </span>(<span class= "ital">klerous</span>) of the Syrians" (Herod. i. 76). The lots of Judah and Simeon fell within two lines drawn to the Mediterranean from the northern and southern extremities of the Dead Sea (Joshua 15).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 The Israelites were convinced that the war against the Canaanites was to be continued; but they were in doubt as to the manner in which it was to be carried on after the death of Joshua. In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.</body></html>
