but in my article on Jethro in Kitto's <span class= "ital">Bible Cyclop?dia </span>I have shown that Jethro and Reuel are identical, the latter name ("friend of God") being his local title as a priest of Midian; and that he was the father of Zipporah and Hobab. When Jethro refused to stay with the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-27.htm" title="And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.">Exodus 18:27</a>), Hobab consented to accompany them as their <span class= "ital">hybeer </span>or caravan-guide. He is well known in the Mohammedan legends as <span class= "ital">Schocib, </span>but is confounded with Jethro.<p>The Kenites were the elder branch of the tribe of Midianites. They lived in the rocky district on the shores of the gulf of Akabah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-1.htm" title="And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.">Numbers 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm" title="And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling place, and you put your nest in a rock.">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm" title="And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.">1Samuel 15:6</a>). They seem to have been named from a chieftain <span class= "ital">Kain </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm" title="The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,">Genesis 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-22.htm" title="Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry you away captive.">Numbers 24:22</a>; <span class= "ital">Heb., </span>where there is a play on Kenite and <span class= "ital">Kinneka, </span>"thy rest"). They were originally a race of troglodytes or cave-dwellers. The Targum constantly reads <span class= "ital">Salmaa </span>for Kenite, because the Kenites were identified with the <span class= "ital">Kinim </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.">1Chronicles 2:55</a>. Jethro, they say. was a Kenite, who gave to Moses a house (<span class= "ital">Beth</span>) and bread (<span class= "ital">lehem</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/2-20.htm" title="And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.">Exodus 2:20-21</a>). They identify Jethro with Salmaa, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-5.htm" title="The sons of Pharez; Hezron, and Hamul.">1Chronicles 2:5</a> <span class= "ital">Salma </span>is the father of <span class= "ital">Bethlehem. </span>They also identify Rechab, the ancestor of the Rechabites--who were a branch of the Kenites--with Rechabiah, the son of Moses.<p><span class= "bld">Went up.</span>--Probably, in the first instance, in a warlike expedition.<p><span class= "bld">The city of palm trees.</span>--Probably Jericho (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm" title="And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, to Zoar.">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-15.htm" title="And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers: then they returned to Samaria.">2Chronicles 28:15</a>). When Jericho was destroyed and laid under a curse, it would be quite in accordance with the Jewish feeling, which attached such "fatal force and fascination" to words, to avoid even the mention of the name. The Kenites would naturally attach less importance to the curse, or at any rate would not consider that they were braving it when they pitched their nomad tents among those beautiful groves of palms and balsams, which once made the soil "a divine country" (Jos. B. J. i. 6. ?6; iv. 8, ? 3; Antt. v. 1, ? 22), though they have now entirely disappeared. Rabbinic tradition says that Jericho was assigned to Hobab. From the omission of the name Jericho, some have needlessly supposed that the reference is to <span class= "ital">Phaenico </span>(a name which means "palm-grove"), an Arabian town mentioned by Diod Sic. iii. 41 (Le Clerc, Bertheau, Ewald); but there is no difficulty about the Kenites leaving Jericho when Judah left it.<p><span class= "bld">The wilderness of Judah.</span>--The Midbar--not a waste desert, but a plain with pasture--was a name applied to the lower Jordan valley and the southern hills of Judea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-14.htm" title="And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.">Genesis 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm" title="What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?">Luke 15:4</a>). The Kenites, like all Bedouins, hated the life of cities, and never lived in them except under absolute necessity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/35-6.htm" title="But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons for ever:">Jeremiah 35:6-7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In the south of Arad.</span>--Our E.V. has, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-1.htm" title="And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.">Numbers 21:1</a>, King Arad; but more correctly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-14.htm" title="And Caleb drove there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.">Joshua 15:14</a>, "the king of Arad." It was a city twenty miles from Hebron, on the road to Petra, and the site is still called Tell-Arad (Wilton, <span class= "ital">Negeb, </span>p. 198). They may have been attracted by the caves in the neighbourhood, and, although they left it at the bidding of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm" title="And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.">1Samuel 15:6</a>), they seem to have returned to it in the days of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-29.htm" title="And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,">1Samuel 30:29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Among the people.</span>--It seems most natural to interpret this of the Israelites of the tribe of Judah; hut it may mean "the people to which he belonged," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm" title="And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,">Numbers 21:21</a>), and this accords with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-21.htm" title="But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:21</a>.
