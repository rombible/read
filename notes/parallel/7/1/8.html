In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/19-11.htm" title="And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.">Judges 19:11-12</a>, the city is called Jebus (with the remark, "which is Jerusalem"), and the Levite expressly refuses to enter it, because it is a "city of the Jebusites," "the city of a stranger."<p><span class= "bld">With the edge of the sword.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">with the mouth of the sword </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-26.htm" title="And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.">Genesis 34:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-24.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.">Joshua 8:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm" title="And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.">Joshua 10:28</a>.

The phrase does not occur elsewhere. And at a later period Josephus tells us that the siege occupied a long time, from the strength of the position (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm" title="Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.">2Samuel 5:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Read <span class="accented">Fought against Jerusalem</span>, <span class="accented">and took it</span>, <span class="accented">and smote it.</span> It is the continuation of the narrative of the exploits of Judah and Simeon in conquering their respective lots. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 The Israelites were convinced that the war against the Canaanites was to be continued; but they were in doubt as to the manner in which it was to be carried on after the death of Joshua. In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.</body></html>
