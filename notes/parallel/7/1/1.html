(3) The events in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10-36</a> are evidently identical with those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/12-9.htm" title="The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;">Joshua 12:9-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-14.htm" title="The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-19.htm" title="The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;">Joshua 12:19</a> (4) The angel's message (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Judges 2:1-5</a>) and the subsequent notices (6-18) are closely parallel with, and sometimes verbally the same as, those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/24-24.htm" title="And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.">Joshua 24:24-33</a>. That these should be records of different and yet most closely analogous series of circumstances is all but impossible. Various ways of accounting for the difficulty have been suggested. (1) Some suppose that many events narrated or touched upon in the Book of Joshua (especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/15-14.htm" title="And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and the cords that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.">Judges 15:14-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/15-16.htm" title="And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps on heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.">Judges 15:16-17</a>, <span class= "ital">&c.</span>) are narrated by anticipation. (2) Clericus arbitrarily supplies the words, "After the death of Joshua <span class= "ital">the Canaanites recovered strength, </span>but in his lifetime <span class= "ital">the children of Israel." </span>(3) Schmidt renders the verbs as pluperfects: "It came to pass after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel had consulted Jehovah," &c. (4) A more recent conjecture is that the name<span class= "ital"> "Joshua" </span>has here crept in by an error of the scribes. If we read, "After the death of Moses," all becomes clear and coherent; and if the book, in its <span class= "ital">original </span>form, possibly began at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>, with the words, "And it came to pass, after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord," &c., the clerical error may have been caused by the addition of prefatory matter to the book at the same time that the appendix (Judges 17-21) was added. It is in favour of the possibility of this suggestion that there are close resemblances between the style and the allusions of the preface, or perhaps we may say of the two prefaces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm" title="And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.">Judges 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/2-11.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:">Judges 2:11-23</a>), and the style and allusions of the last five chapters: e.<span class= "ital">g</span>., in the references to Judah, Jerusalem, and Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Judges 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm" title="And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?

(5) On the other hand, the conjecture can only be regarded as <span class= "ital">possible, </span>since it is not supported by a single MS. or suggested by any ancient commentator. It is perhaps simpler to suppose that the book originally began with the words, "Now after the death of Joshua," and that this beginning was left unaltered as a <span class= "ital">general </span>description of the book when the prefatory matter and appendix were attached to it.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Israel.</span>--Mainly, it would seem, the western tribes.<p><span class= "bld">Asked the Lord.</span>--The phrase is peculiar, meaning, literally, <span class= "ital">enquired in Jehovah </span>(as we find it in the LXX.). The usual construction is "<span class= "ital">Shaal eth-Jehovah" </span>("asked the Lord"). This phrase (<span class= "ital">shaal be</span>)<span class= "ital"> is </span>only found again in. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/20-23.htm" title="(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)">Judges 20:23-27</a>. Rabbi Tanchum (whose commentary on this book has been edited by Schnurrer and Haarbrcker) says that the phrase implies the consultation of Jehovah through the high priest by means of the Urim and Thummim. "To ask of <span class= "ital">Elohim" </span>occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm" title="And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.">Judges 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm" title="And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.">Judges 20:18</a>. Similarly in Greek, "to ask God" (Xen. <span class= "ital">Mem. viii.</span> 3) means to consult an oracle. If the narrative of this chapter be <span class= "ital">retrospective, </span>the high priest must have been Eleazar, the son of Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-1.htm" title="And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.">Joshua 14:1</a>); if not, it must have been his son Phinehas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-33.htm" title="And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.">Joshua 24:33</a>), as Josephus seems to imply (Jos. <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, ? 1). On this method of inquiring of God, in the absence of any authoritative declaration on the part of a prophet, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-14.htm" title="And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.">Joshua 9:14</a>. On the Urim and Thummim, which was <span class= "ital">not </span>the jewelled "breastplate of judgment," but something which was put "in it," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>. It is probably useless to inquire as to the method by which the will of God was revealed by the Urim and Thummim. The words mean "lights and perfections," or something closely resembling those conceptions. The Rabbis were themselves ignorant as to the exact nature of the Urim and Thummim, and the mode in which they were used. One favourite theory is that adopted by Milton, when he speaks of Aaron's breastplate as having been "ardent with gems oracular." It identifies the Urim with the twelve gems, and supposes that the answers of God were spelt out by a mystic light which gleamed over these gems. But not to dwell on the fact that the names of the tribes did not contain all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, this explanation is not consistent with the distinction made between the breastplate which was on the ephod, and the Urim and Thummim that were placed <span class= "ital">inside </span>it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>). Another theory supposes that the mind of the high priest was abstracted from earthly things by gazing on the gems until the will of God was revealed to him. A third regards the Urim and Thummim as cut and uncut gems, kept in the folds of the breastplate, and used almost like lots. These are but theories, and in all probability the exact truth, which has now been forgotten for thousands of years, will never be discovered.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall go up for us . . .?</span>--At the solemn investiture of Joshua, as the successor of Moses, Moses is directed to "set him before Eleazar the priest," who was "to ask consent for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord: <span class= "ital">at his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in</span>" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/27-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;">Numbers 27:18-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After the death of Joshua</span>. The events narrated in chs. 1. and Deuteronomy 2:1-9 all occurred before the death of Joshua, as appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-8.htm">Judges 2:8, 9</a>, and by a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6-15</a> and Joshua 15:13-20. The words, <span class="accented">and it came to pass after the death of Joshua</span>, must therefore be understood (if the text is incorrupt) as the heading of the whole book, just as the Book of Joshua has for its heading, "Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass." <span class="cmt_word">Asked the Lord</span>. The same phrase as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">asked counsel of.</span> So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>, where a special direction is given to Joshua to make such inquiries as that mentioned in this verse before Eleazar the priest, through the judgment of Urim and Thummim (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-10.htm">1 Samuel 23:10, 12</a>). A still more common rendering of the Hebrew phrase in the A.V. is "to inquire of God" (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>, and many other places). Such inquiries were made <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by Urim and Thummin, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the word of the Lord through a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>), or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> simply by prayer, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>), and improperly of false gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2, 16</a>), of teraphim, and semi-idolatrous priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 The Israelites were convinced that the war against the Canaanites was to be continued; but they were in doubt as to the manner in which it was to be carried on after the death of Joshua. In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.</body></html>
