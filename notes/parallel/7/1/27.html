It is again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm" title="Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:">1Kings 4:12</a>, and in later days was well known under the name of Scytho-polis, or "city of Scythians" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/12-29.htm" title="From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem,">2 Maccabees 12:29</a>), a name contemptuously given to it from the barbarism of its inhabitants (Jos. <span class= "ital">Vit. </span>6). Though conquered by Manasseh, it was in the lot of Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm" title="And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.">Joshua 17:11</a>).

The only event connected with it in Scripture is the death of Ahaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm" title="But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.">2Kings 9:27</a>). Perhaps Khirbet-Belameh.<p><span class= "bld">Megiddo.</span>--Near Taanach. It is now called <span class= "ital">Lejj-n, </span>from having been a station of the Romans.

From this town is derived the famous name Armageddon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-16.htm" title="And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.">Revelation 16:16</a>) as a scene of battle and wailing.<p><span class= "bld">The Canaanites would dwell in that land</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the old inhabitants obstinately and successfully held their own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-12.htm" title="Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.">Joshua 17:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-36 The people of Israel were very careless of their duty and interest. Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains to complete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: they were willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they might make advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation of idolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the full possession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprived them of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many a believer who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lusts revive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recovers its hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart, discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he may have sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet he will have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; and upon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying God and serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with the enemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore our only wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.</body></html>
