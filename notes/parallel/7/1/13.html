It is here added that he was Caleb's younger brother.

The Hebrew may mean either that Othniel was "son of Kenaz and brother of Caleb" (in which case he married his niece); or "son of Kenaz, who was Caleb's brother" (as in "Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm" title="But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.">2Samuel 13:3</a>), in which case Achsah was his cousin. The Masoretes, to whom is due the punctuation, &c., of our Hebrew Scriptures, show by their pointing that they understood the words in the <span class= "ital">former </span>sense. But though Ben-kenaz may simply mean Kenezite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm" title="Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.">Numbers 32:12</a>), it is strange in that case that Othniel should never be called a son of Jephunneh. If he was a brother of Caleb's, he must have lived to extreme old age, and have been an old man when he married Achsah. For the importance of Caleb's family, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-15.htm" title="The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:15</a>.
