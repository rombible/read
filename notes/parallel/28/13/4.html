but I did not show them to thee that thou shouldest go after them, and I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - These verses make it evident that the punishment inflicted on Israel could not reasonably be accounted too severe; such had been the goodness of Jehovah and the gross ingratitude of Israel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt</span>. The prophet here commences a recital of God's favors to Israel from ancient times, all which they forgot, ungratefully and impiously turning aside from the worship of Jehovah. Jehovah had been Israel's God long before, but never before had the evidence of his power and love to his people been so signal and conspicuous as at the period of the Exodus and onward. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt know no god but me.</span> The use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> in the imperfect is to connect the future with the past. It may be rendered either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Thou knowest," viz. a God of such wonderful attestation thou knowest or findest not beside me - the opposite of the statement, "Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-3.htm">Deuteronomy 13:3</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Thou shouldest not know or recognize any god beside me." So Kimchi: "Thou shouldest not know other gods, nor serve them beside me, for ye see there is no helper Beside me." Likewise Rashi: "Thou shouldest not rebel against me." Also Aben Ezra: "How hast thou turned to kiss the calf, which does not save nor satisfy, and hast left him who has been thy God from ancient days, who has helped thee and knows all thy necessities." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, which, as the cognate Arabic signifies, "to go forth or away") is synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-8 While Ephraim kept up a holy fear of God, and worshipped Him in that fear, so long he was very considerable. When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.</body></html>
