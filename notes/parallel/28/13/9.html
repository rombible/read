The ellipsis is accounted for by the strong emotion of the speaker, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the Piel third person, and has the suffix of the second person, from which the pronoun <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> may be supplied as subject of the concluding clause. The preposition be has here the meaning of "against," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>, while <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is in apposition to it. The Hebrew commentators take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d9;</span> as a verbal form; thus Rashi: "Thou hast destroyed thyself, O Israel;" and Kimchi: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The calf has destroyed thee which he had mentioned above; he says, 'This has destroyed thee; for unless this had been so, thy help had been in me.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The Septuagint and Jerome take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5d7;&#x5da;</span> as a noun, the former translating by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;</span>: "Who will aid thee in thy destructions" the latter by "Thy destruction, O Israel; but in me is thy help," the noun being of the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>. The explanation of Rashi, who understands <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the verb as second person preterit Piel with suffix, is: "'Because thou hast acted unfaithfully against me, thou hast rebelled against thy help.' The Scripture uses brevity, but he who understands the language of Scripture will recall to mind that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is 'because against me is the rebellion with which thou hast rebelled. And if thou shouldst say, What does it concern thee? Against thy help hast thou rebelled when thou didst rebel against me.'" Kimchi remarks in the two <span class="accented">beths</span> servile that one of them would suffice, and that the sense might have been expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5da;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5da;</span> . All the disaster and destruction previously mentioned are charged on Israel's misconduct; they had brought all upon themselves by their rebellion against Jehovah who would otherwise have been their Shield and Deliverer. The sense is well expressed by Calvin thus: "How comes it, and what is the reason, that I do not now help thee according to my usual manner? Thou hast indeed found me hitherto to be thy Deliverer.... How comes it now that I have cast thee away, that thou criest in vain, and that no one brings thee any help? How comes it that thou art thus forsaken, and receivest no relief whatever from my hand, as thou hast been wont to do? And doubtless I should never be wanting to thee, if thou wouldest allow me; but thou closest the door against me, and by thy wickedness spurnest my favor, so that it cannot come to thee. It then follows, that thou art now destroyed through thine own fault: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Something</span> then hath destroyed thee." It will be observed that the rebellion against Jehovah here complained of is not that of all Israel, when they are said to have rejected Jehovah by asking a king of Samuel; but the defection of the ten tribes that cast off their allegiance to the house of David and made Jeroboam their king. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but he could not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.</body></html>
