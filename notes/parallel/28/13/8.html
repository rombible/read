"The caul of the heart" means here the covering of the heart, not the pericardium, but the breast in which the claws of the beast are fastened.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart.</span> The noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span> is epicene, that is, the one form serves for both genders, as here the masculine includes the feminine, and is used as such. Of all animals, Jerome says, the she-bear is the fiercest, either when robbed of her whelps or in want of food. <span class="accented">Seghor</span> being that which encloses the heart, is either the pericardium, the immediate and proper enclosure of the heart, or the breast itself. The reference is to a beast of prey which seizes its victim by the breast and tears it open, so that the heart is exposed. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e9;</span> is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e2;</span>, the meaning of the root-syllable <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;</span>, to meet, strike, being the same in both. Such is the continuation of the picture of the threatened punishment. The picture of the severity of the Divine judgment here presented is very terrible. Kimchi remarks on this picture: "A bear robbed, whose young ones they have slain, which is bereft and bitter in spirit, if it find man or beast rends it speedily." Some understand the verse figuratively, as though it meant "'I will rend their obstinate heart,' the enclosure of the heart being equivalent to a shut or obstinate heart, as, in ver. 5 of this same chapter, 'a land of drought' is pretty much the same as 'a dry or parched land.' Thus the Chaldee translates, 'I have broken the wickedness of their heart.'" <span class="cmt_word">And there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</span> <span class="accented">Sham</span> there refers <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to '<span class="accented">al-derekh</span> of the preceding verse; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as Kimchi explains it, as referring to their cities: "There in their cities shall I destroy them by pestilence and by the sword of the enemy, like the lion that teareth without pity;" or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> more simply still, "there on the spot." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, is the wild beast as opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, domestic animals. While some were to be destroyed by famine and pestilence, others would perish by the wild beast of the field. "Also," says Kimchi, "shall the wild beast of the field rend them outside (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. outside their cities), as, ' I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number.'" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-8 While Ephraim kept up a holy fear of God, and worshipped Him in that fear, so long he was very considerable. When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.</body></html>
