The original demand for a king who should be a visible token to Israel of protection against their surrounding foes was adverse to the true spirit of the kingdom of God upon earth, and, though granted, proved to the united kingdom, and afterwards to the kingdom of Israel, an age-long curse. Probably the special reference here is to the latter--the erection of the Ten Tribes into a separate monarchy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-16.</span> - The concluding verse is at once a conclusion and commencement - an inference from what preceded, and the beginning of a second line of proof showing that, while their ruin was by themselves, their restoration would be by God. When the kings and princes whom they had sinfully sought, and who had been given to them in anger would fail, God himself would be their King, as is stated in vers. 10 and 11. Further, when in consequence of their iniquities treasured up, their sorrows and sufferings would be extreme, as stated in vers. 12 and 13, yet they would be raised up as out of their graves, as promised in ver. 14. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - Israel had shown contempt for Jehovah by putting confidence in kings of their own choice, yet these kings could not afford them help, whence the questions of ver. 10. The usual rendering is at fault. <span class="cmt_word">I will be thy King.</span> This should rather be, <span class="accented">Where now is thy king?</span> though <span class="accented">ehi</span> may be either verb or adverb. <span class="cmt_word">Where is any other that may says thee in all thy cities?</span> Better take both clauses together and in connection, thus: <span class="accented">Where, now, is thy kin</span>g<span class="accented">, that he may save thee in all thy cities?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word <span class="accented">ehi</span> we take, with Ewald, to be a dialectic variation for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, or shortened form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, and this is strengthened by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> or Latin <span class="accented">tandem</span>, for sake of emphasis. The purpose for which the Israelites had asked a king was that he might "judge them and go out before them to fight their battles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>). The question, then, does not indicate the want of a king, or the prevalence of a state of anarchy, but that a crisis had come when such a king as they had requested should exhibit his prowess and display his power. It is as though the prophet asked, or rather God by his servant," Where is now the king that can defend the besieged cities, or deliver the attacked fortresses; and defeat the Assyrian foeman who is now threatening both? Or where are the judges (<span class="accented">shophetim</span>), or the princes (<span class="accented">sarim</span>), who constitute his cabinet or royal counselors sharing in the counsels of state, and administering the affairs of the kingdom under him?" The answer implied is that those visible helps, on which Israel had so confidently calculated, turned out valueless; the kingly constitution on which they had set their heart proved a failure, as far as help and deliverance were concerned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span> as first person future of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>; thus: "I shall be established for ever, but where is thy king? Whereas thou didst reject my kingdom, and demanded a king who should save you; and it should be he that would save you in all your cities against which the enemies came." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but he could not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.</body></html>
