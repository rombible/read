The name Ephraim, signifying "double-fruitfulness," shall be verified, confirming the promised redemption from death, and, by the pledge of blessing, which the name implies affording a guarantee that the coming storm would not quite overwhelm them. The play on the name Ephraim fixes the meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, the <span class="accented">aleph</span> taking the place of <span class="accented">he</span>. The Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, equivalent to "shall cause a division," and Jerome's <span class="accented">divider</span>, suppose <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>. But though fruitful among the other tribes, yet the abuse of that fruitfulness invited the instrument of destruction. There is an allusion to the patriarchal blessing, "Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well;" the source of his fruitfulness was that well or fountain; while the drying up of it would be the certain cause of barrenness. <span class="cmt_word">An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness.</span> Thus, while Ephraim presents the pleasing picture of a fair and fruitful tree, the element of destruction is already on the way. A wind, the east wind, with its rude vehemence, blighting heat, and desolating effect, was coming. It was a wind, not coming by chance, but commissioned by Jehovah as a minister of vengeance to execute his wrath. It was, moreover, a wind issuing forth from its home in the desert, and fraught with fiery heat from the scorching sands of the Arabian desert. <span class="cmt_word">And his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.</span> This flourishing tree, planted by the living spring, to which it owed its vigor and verdure, was doomed soon to wither in consequence of the drying up of the waters, that nourished it, by the east wind. <span class="cmt_word">He shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</span> Here the figure merges in the fact. The Assyrian conqueror was the blustering east wind, that swept like a whirlwind with his armies from the east. He not only ravaged the country, but rifled the treasures of the capital The <span class="accented">keli chemdah</span> included all the valuables and treasures of Samaria referred to in the following verse. Kimchi explains the verse as follows: "For Ephraim was fruitful among brethren as long as he did not make calves. He became increasingly great and fruitful among his brethren, as Jacob said of him.... And now that he has sinned, an east wind of the Lord shall come; and it is the King of Assyria that is meant. And he compares him to the east wind, because it is a wind from the east, for the land of Assyria lies to the east of the land of Israel; and further he says, 'east wind,' because it is a violent wind. And he says, 'wind of Jehovah,' to magnify the wind and emphasize it; and he says also, 'spirit of Jehovah,' because Jehovah the blessed stirred up his spirit (i.e. spirit of the King of Assyria) to come against Israel, 'goeth up from the wilderness;' wind is always in the wilderness. Or the explanation is, because the wilderness is between the land of Israel and the land of Assyria; and before this wind, which is the King of Assyria, is dried up the fountain of Ephraim, which was at first like a tree flourishing by the waters." And now before this wind shall its spring become dry and its fountain dried up. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, is an irregular formation for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as on the contrary we find the Hiph. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as if from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but he could not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.</body></html>
