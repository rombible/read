Their irrational and God-dishonoring conduct was bringing on them sure and swift destruction. The prophet employs four figures to exhibit their political extinction. Two of these, the morning cloud and early dew, or rather the dew early passing away, have already been employed by him to characterize the transient nature of Israel's goodness; here they denote the evanescent nature of their national existence. The other two are the chaff and the smoke; the former whirled away by the storm-wind from the threshing-floor, the latter dissipated and speedily vanishing as soon as it escapes from the chimney or lattice. Such shall be the utter extermination of Israel. The senselessness of their idolatry had been treated with derision in the preceding verse; the punishment of their sin is sternly denounced in this. Kimchi comments concisely and correctly thus: "Therefore they shall go to destruction, and shall be as the morning cloud, or as the dew speedily disappearing in the morning, width vanishes when the heat of the sun has touched it; so they shall go away speedily. So also shall they be as chaff - it is the fine particles of straw, which the wind whirls away from the threshing-floor; thus shall they be whirled away from their land. Or as a pillar of smoke which goes forth out of the lattice, which shall speedily disperse and cease." Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> lattice, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;</span>, to knit or twist, the Septuagint, according to Jerome, read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> locusts, as may be inferred from their rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the Complete-Man edition of the LXX., erroneously written in some copies <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, that is, vapor from locusts or from tears. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-8 While Ephraim kept up a holy fear of God, and worshipped Him in that fear, so long he was very considerable. When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.</body></html>
