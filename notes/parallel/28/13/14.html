O grave, where is your victory?">1Corinthians 15:55</a>. The rendering of the English version is, however, supported by the Targum, Symmachus, Jerome, and many modern expositors. But the former interpretation is to be preferred. Many Christian interpreters (Henderson, Pusey, &c.) regard this as the sudden outburst of a gracious promise (as St. Paul takes it). The last clause then signifies that the gift and calling of God are without repentance. There is no room for any further merciful change of purpose. But the objection to this interpretation is that in the same breath the prophet rushes on to the most sweeping condemnation. Accordingly Schmoller, Wnsche, Huxtable (<span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and others understand the passage thus: "Shall I ransom them (doomed and dying in agonised travail) from the hand (or power) of Hades? Shall I redeem them from death? (Alas! no.) Where are thy plagues, O death? (Bring them forth.) Where is thy sting, O Hades? (Strike these reprobate ones.) Relenting is hid from my eyes." It should be remembered that St. Paul quoted from Isaiah, "Death shall be swallowed up in victory," and then, as here, calls in derisive irony upon death and Sheol to do their very worst at the very moment when they are about to be cast into the lake of fire.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.</span> God here promises them deliverance from utter ruin; the grave shall be thus deprived of his victim, and the victim rescued out of the tyrant grasp of death. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is to redeem by payment of a price; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> by right of kinship; while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, the under world, is derived <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some from <span class="hebrew">&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to ask or demand, and is favored by such statements as the following: "There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: the grave," and so on; "Who enlargeth his desire as well, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied." Others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> derive it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> (by a softening of the <span class="accented">ayin</span> into <span class="accented">aleph</span>), to be hollow; but this signification of the word is not satisfactorily established. A third <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> derivation is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, to hang down loose or slack, then to be deep, or low, and so the noun comes to signify sinking, depth, abyss. <span class="cmt_word">O Death, I will be thy plagues; O Grave, I will be thy destruction</span>. Thus <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> incorrectly taken by some for the first person future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>; it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> more properly taken in the sense of "where," as in ver. 10 of the present chapter. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> is plural, referred by some to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, hence <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x1fc6;</span>, LXX.; it is, however, the plural of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, pestilence, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, pestilence, destruction, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span>, to cut off, akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d1;</span>. Hitzig says that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span> are originally infinitives, and the last two designate instruments or members, and thus give a sort of support to the traditional <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the LXX. Now, this verse has been understood by some in the sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of consolation; and by others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in that of combination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the latter sense it is understood by the Hebrew commentators, and by not a few Christian interpreters. Thus Rashi: "I am he who redeemed them from the hand of Sheol, and delivered them from death; but now I will set myself to speak against thee words of death." Aben Ezra: "I redeemed thy fathers; now I shall be thy deadly pestilence; I will also be thy destruction." Kimehi is more diffuse, as usual; he explains thus: "I would have redeemed them from the power of Sheol, if they had been wise. But now that he is not wise, but a feel, and denies my goodness, it is not enough that I shall not redeem thee from death, but I shall bring upon thee death by pestilence, and by the sword, and by famine, and by evil beast." The condition supplied by Kimchi is entirely arbitrary and without anything in the context to suggest it. Calvin in like manner interjects a <span class="accented">condition</span>; thus: "I will redeem them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death; that is, except they resist, I will become willingly their Redeemer. Some have, therefore, rendered the passage in the subjunctive mood, 'From the hand of the grave I would redeem them, from death I would deliver them.... I will then redeem them, as far as this depends on me;' for a condition is to be introduced, as though God came forth and declared that he was present to fulfill the office of a Redeemer. What, then, does stand in the way? Even the hardness of the people. He afterwards adds, 'I will be thy perdition, O Death; I will be thy excision, O Grave.' By these words the prophet more distinctly sets forth the power of God, and magnificently extols it, lest men should think that there is no way open to him to save, when no hope according to the judgment of the flesh appears. Hence the prophet says, 'Though men are now dead, there is yet nothing to prevent God to quicken them. How so? For he is the ruin of death, and the excision of the grave;' that is, 'Though death should swallow up all men, though the grave should consume them, yet God is superior to both death and the grave, for he can slay death, for he can abolish the grave.' He afterwards proceeds to "answer to that which is said of Paul quoting this passage. The solution is not difficult. The apostles do not avowedly at all times adduce passages which in their whole context apply to the subject they handle; but sometimes they allude to a word only, sometimes they apply a passage to a subject in the way of resemblance, and sometimes they bring forward passages as testimonies. When the apostles use the testimonies of Scripture, then the genuine and real truth must be sought out; but when they glance only at one word, there is no occasion to make any anxious inquiry; and when they quote any passage of Scripture in the way of resemblance, it is a too scrupulous anxiety to seek out how all the parts agree. But it is quite evident that Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, has not quoted the testimony of the prophet for the purpose of confirming the doctrine el which he speaks. What then? As the resurrection of the flesh was a truth very difficult to be believed, nay, wholly contrary to the judgment of nature, Paul says that it is no matter of wonder...because it is the peculiar prerogative of God to be the perdition of death and the destruction of the grave.... He is endued with that incomprehensible power by which he can raise us from a state of putrefaction; nay, since he created the world from nothing, he will also raise us up from the grave, for he is the death of death, the grave of the grave, the ruin of ruin, and the destruction of destruction; and the simple object of Paul is to extol by these striking words that incredible power of God, which is beyond the reach of human understanding." Others viewing the subject in the same light, read the clauses <span class="accented">interrogatively</span>, and the imperfects in a subjunctive sense; thus - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"From the power of Sheol should I ransom them?<br />From death deliver them?'</span> The answer being, "Certainly not." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Where are thy pestilences. O Death?<br />Where is thy destruction, O Sheol? <br />Let those pestilences and that destruction<br />be produced for Ephraim's ruin."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Repentance</span> (<span class="accented">relenting</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall be hid from mine eyes.</span> This Rashi explains: "I will feel no regret over this calamity." But we greatly prefer the sense of consolation assigned by many Christian interpreters to the passage. No doubt the verse before and that following this fourteenth verse are a threat which probably induced so many, as we have seen, to include this verse in the menace. But the abruptness of the prophet's style sufficiently accounts for a bright Messianic promise to relieve the gloom of the dark predictions among which it is interjected. Redemption from the power of Sheol signifies, not merely deliverance from danger and deliverance from death, but deliverance from the under world by rescuing the living from the region of the dead, or rescuing from the realm of death those already subject to his grim dominion; while the destruction of death is celebrated in words of triumph, as Theodoret says, "He gives command to sing a paean over [literally, 'against'] death." To the Israelites the promise signified the power of the Lord to redeem from death and restore them from destruction to newness of life, just as the dead dry bones of Israel in the valley of Ezekiel's vision are restored to life. The use which Paul makes of this verse when he couples it with the words of Isaiah, "Death is swallowed up in victory," in <a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>, is to confirm the full and final annihilation of death at the resurrection. This fuller and deeper meaning, dimly unfolded to Old Testament saints, was clearly brought to light in New Testament Scripture. The absence of repentance denotes the irrevocable accomplishment of the Divine purpose of salvation. Pussy has pertinently remarked upon this verse: "God by his prophets mingles promises of mercy in the midst of his threats of punishment. His mercy overflows the bounds of the occasion upon which he makes it known. He had sentenced Ephraim to temporal destruction. This was unchangeable. He points to that which turns all temporal loss into gain, that eternal redemption. The words are the fullest which could have been chosen. The word rendered 'ransom' signifies rescued them by the payment of a price; the word rendered 'redeem' relates to one who, as the nearest of kin, had the right to acquire anything as his own by paying that price. Both words, in their exactest sense, describe what Jesus did, buying us with a price... and becoming our near kinsman by his incarnation.... The words refuse to be tied down to a temporal deliverance. A little longer continuance in Canaan is not a redemption from the power of the grave; nor was Ephraim so delivered." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but he could not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.</body></html>
