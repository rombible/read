The English version follows the interpretation of the Targum. But the LXX., Vulg., and Syriac versions are based on a slightly different reading of the text contained in some Hebrew MSS. They render, "as a panther on the way to Assyria."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - These verses teach that the result of their sins is inevitable destruction, and that Jehovah, merciful and gracious though he is, has now divested himself of all compassion on them. The appropriateness of the terrible figures here employed arises from the fact that Israel had been compared in the previous verse to a flock fed and filled in a luxuriant pasture; the punishment of that flock is now fitly compared to "the tearing in pieces and devouring of that fattened flock by wild beasts." The beasts in question are a lion, a leopard, a bear, a lioness, and fierce wild beasts in general. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I will be unto them as a lion.</span> The verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is the future changed into the preterit or past tense by <span class="accented">vav</span> consecutive, and marks the consequence of forgetting God. So Aben Ezra: "The preterit in reference to the evils which Jehovah brought upon them." While the past thus implies that the punishment has commenced, the futures which follow denote its continuance. Rosenm&uuml;ller regards the preterit here as prophetic and continuative, and paraphrases the meaning by, "I have at length become and have been, and shall continue to be to them." He considers the reference of the preterit to be to past disasters, especially the various defeats sustained by Israel at the hand of the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>) and the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). He also very aptly compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7-10</a> in relation to the subject in hand. The Prophet Isaiah, after relating the loving-kindnesses of the Lord and his praises and his great goodness to the house of Israel on the one hand, and their rebellion and vexing his Holy Spirit on the other hand, adds, "Therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them." <span class="cmt_word">As a leopard by the way will I observe them.</span> The lion and the leopard are frequently conjoined, as animals of like natural ferocity, by the ancients both in sacred and secular writings. The outlook on the way is for the purpose of springing upon the passers-by. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> is properly <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to look around, and thence, to lie in wait; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some, taking the initial <span class="accented">aleph</span> as radical and the word as participle of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, translate it by "<span class="accented">trodden</span> way," that is, away trodden and frequented by men and animals. The LXX. and Vulgate again, also Jerome, Hitzig, and Ewald, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> translate it by" <span class="accented">on the way</span> of the Assyrians," either referring to the time when they would be led captive by the Assyrians or when they persisted in going thither to sue for aid. But the name of Assyria is always written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, as Rashi rightly observes: "In every place where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;</span> occurs in Scripture (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as a proper name) it has daghesh (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in the <span class="accented">shin</span>); yet here it has raphe, [to show] that it is not the name of a place, but a verb: 'I observe and keep watch,' as 'I shall observe him, but not nigh' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>)." Kimchi explains the verse as follows: "Because they have forgotten me, I also have rejected them, and have left them in the hand of the peoples; and have become to them like a lion or leopard, which observes the way, and is prepared to tear whatever passes by it on the way. Just so have I been to them, for I have caused their enemies to rule over them, and they have not had power to deliver themselves from their hand until they returned to me, and I took pity upon them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-8 While Ephraim kept up a holy fear of God, and worshipped Him in that fear, so long he was very considerable. When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.</body></html>
