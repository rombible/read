Rashi has a similar rendering of the word <span class="accented">retheth</span>, which is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and causes the diversity of translation in this clause; but his exposition of the whole sentence is vague and unsatisfactory. Referring it to Jeroboam of the tribe of Ephraim, he explains as follows: "When Jeroboam, zealous for God, spoke against Solomon hard words, and with terror, Solomon was a great king." Pococke's exposition is in harmony with the Authorized Version, and is the following: "When Ephraim spake with fear and trembling (like his forefather Jacob, in his humble supplication to God), he exalted himself in Israel." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the rendering adopted by most moderns, is decidedly preferable, as agreeing better with the context, and much more in bar-runny with tribal characteristics of Ephraim, as intimated in this very book, and exhibited elsewhere. The translation we thus prefer is: "When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he, even he, exalted himself in Israel." Such was the fear inspired, and the deference paid to the authority of that powerful tribe. The word <span class="accented">reheth</span>, though not found elsewhere, has a cognate root in Aramaic, with the meaning here assigned to it; for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> is to fear, shudder, tremble; there is also, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, equivalent to "fear," similar in both sense and sound. The Chaldee supports this rendering; its paraphrase is: "When one of the house of Ephraim spake, trembling seized the peoples." Also Aben Ezra and Kimchi. The former's brief comment is: "Before his speaking the peoples were afraid; and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> has no analogue except in the Aramaic." Kimchi's explanation is, "From the beginning, before Ephraim sinned, the fear of him was great over the peoples who surrounded him; for when he spake, fear and trembling were wont to seize him who heard him; and he was great and strong among the tribes of Israel, as it was said of him, ' And his seed shall be a multitude of nations.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. renders <span class="accented">reheth</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, thus:" According to the word of Ephraim, be adopted ordinances for himself in Israel," that is, when Ephraim spoke, the rest of the Israelites assented to his ordinances and rights, reverencing his authority, so that the general sense differs little from the Chaldee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller constructs and explains differently; his exposition runs somehow thus: "When Ephraim spake, instituting that horrible worship of the calves, he himself bore the sin of that horrible dictum, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was guilty of, and bore its punishment." This explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5d0;</span> is farfetched and unnatural. We have no hesitation in preferring "lifted up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his head, or exalted himself, for, though it is usually the Hithp. that is employed in this sense, examples also occur in which Qal is so used, for example <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>. Kimchi supplies <span class="accented">rosho</span>. We adhere, therefore, to the rendering and exposition of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>. <span class="cmt_word">But when he offended in Baal, he died.</span> This was not merely the calf-worship which, for political reasons, Jeroboam instituted and his successors retained, but the worship of Baal for which, no doubt, the calf-worship had prepared the way, and which had been introduced by Ahab at the instigation of his Sidonian queen. And though the people were partially and temporarily reformed through the efforts of Elijah the prophet and by the royal authority of Jehu, son of Nimshi, the evil was not eradicated, but frequently broke out again. The exaltation of Ephraim was not so much his distinction among his brethren as the governmental predominance at which that tribe ever aimed. That elevation, however, was soon followed by religious declension, culminating in the idolatry of Baal, which soon sealed the doom of the northern kingdom, thenceforth given up to destruction. The sentence of death was pronounced, and the actual dying commenced with the introduction of idolatrous worship. Thus, correctly, Kimchi: "He lifted up his head in Israel. And after he offended in Baal he died, as if he said, he was beaten before his enemies, as if he were dead, the power of his hand had departed." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-8 While Ephraim kept up a holy fear of God, and worshipped Him in that fear, so long he was very considerable. When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God.

Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.</body></html>
