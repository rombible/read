(who had a slightly different text), renders "according to their pattern of idols." (Comp. the language of satire in Psalms 115; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-10.htm" title="Who has formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?">Isaiah 44:10-17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Men that sacrifice</span>.--More accurately, <span class= "ital">sacrificers from among men.</span> Others would render "sacrificers of men." But the former is quite consistent with Hebrew usage, while the latter compels us to adopt the unwarrantable supposition that human sacrifices formed part of the calf-worship. The calf images were kissed ike those of the Madonna in Roman Catholic churches at the present day. The Greek <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span>, <span class= "ital">"</span>to worship," meant originally to adore by kissing (Curtius, <span class= "ital">Greek Etymology,</span> p. 158).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now they sin more and more</span> (margin, <span class="accented">add to sin</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen.</span> This part of the verse declares their persistent adherence to idolatry. The note of time, "and now," marks the transition from the past period, when Baal-worship had been introduced by Ahab and subsequently overturned by Jehu, to the prophet's own day. Not content with the calves of Jeroboam and the worship of Baal, they added new superstitions and new hideous objects of worship. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, a molten image, like the molten calf of Aaron, is singular, but used collectively, so as to correspond with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, idols, which is plural. The reference here is, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> not to the calves or to Baal, but to various other idols which they had adopted, as at Gilgal and Beersheba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>). Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> not content with the calves, they introduced gods of their own as their penates. The <span class="accented">material</span> out of which these molten images were manufactured was silver. Kimchi, however, gives a curious explanation in proof that the material was gold: "The calves," he says, "were not silver, but he means to say that, of the silver which they each one gave to procure gold to make the calves, they made for themselves idols according to their understanding; and these were the calves." The <span class="accented">manner</span> in which they made these idols was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">in their understanding</span>, that is, in their understanding, such as it was, so stupidly employed in such sensuous work, or their proficiency in the art of graving. Kimchi explains it somewhat differently: "The explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span> is, 'As if they had carefully reflected on the matter what form they should give it, and then had agreed to make a calf, as they did in the wilderness.'" The reading of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> is disputed, but without sufficient ground. No doubt the Septuagint, which is followed by the Chaldee, Arabic, and Jerome, probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, to build, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, figure, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; for they translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">according to the likeness</span> or fashion of idols; while some manuscripts of Kennicott and De Rossi present <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">according to their understanding</span>, their own peculiar notions or fancy, and not as Moses, who made everything after the pattern showed him in the mount. The full form would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, but the feminine form is shortened before the suffix, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>); and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-8.htm">Proverbs 7:8</a>); <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a>). Some suppose it from a masculine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, of the same meaning. The <span class="accented">defect</span> of this man-made god is expressed by its being all of it the work of the craftsmen, without any element of sense, spirit, or divinity in it. On which Kimchi has well observed: "The whole calf is the work of the hands of the craftsman; there is nothing spiritual in it; as he says, 'There is no breath at all in the midst of it' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">They say of them, Let the men that sacrifice</span> (margin, <span class="accented">the sacrificers of men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>kiss the calves</span>. The best explanation of this difficult clause is, in our opinion, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Keil. His translation, though slightly different from that of the Authorized Version, has the same general import; thus: "Of them (the '<span class="accented">atsabbim</span>, idols) they say, viz. 'the sacrificers from among men' equivalent to 'the men who sacrifice,' Let them worship calves. By the apposition <span class="accented">zobheche</span> '<span class="accented">adam</span>, and the fact that the object '<span class="accented">agalim is</span> placed first, so that it stands in immediate contrast to '<span class="accented">adam</span>, the absurdity of men kissing calves, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worshipping them with kisses (see at 1 Kings 19:18), is painted, as it were, before the eyes." As parallel <span class="accented">to zobheche</span> '<span class="accented">adam</span>, comp. <span class="accented">evyone</span> '<span class="accented">adam</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>). Several eminent modern commentators give the same or a similar explanation, with the exception that, instead of translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "of them," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the idols, as Keil does. They translate it "to them," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the idol-worshippers. Kimchi in the main favors this explanation; he says, "On their account (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. on account of the calves) the priests of the calf say to the people who come to offer sacrifice: by the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> he means: whoever of the children of men that wish to offer, 'Let them kiss the calves on their mouth; for their worship shall not be perfect until they shall kiss them,' for so was their custom." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> many of the older interpreters among the Hebrews, as also Jerome, Cyril, and Theodoret among Christians, refer the expression to human sacrifices, thus: "Sacrificing men, they kiss, that is, adore, calves." The explanation according to this view, as given by Schmid, is to the following purport: "To <span class="accented">these</span> who now worship many idols, and among them Moloch, to whom they even sacrifice men, <span class="accented">those</span> the fathers of such as only worshipped the calves or Baal, would say, if they were alive, 'Let those who sacrifice men give over such cruel sacrifice, and rather kiss calves as we did.'" Rashi's comment is: "The idol priests say to Israel, 'He that sacrifices his son to idols is worthy to kiss the calf, for he has presented to him a pleasant gift.' So have our rabbins in (the tract) Sanhedrin explained, and it suits the text of Scripture bettor than the translation of Jonathan;" while that of Aben Ezra is as follows: "<span class="accented">To</span> them say the <span class="accented">sons</span> of men, in order to mock them [<span class="accented">kiss</span> the calves], because they kiss Baalim which are the images of calves, as 'And every month that has not kissed trim' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>), while they shed innocent blood, and this is, ' And his blood shall he leave upon him' (Hosea 12:15). And lo! he has reversed the manner of' every man, for man kisses man who is his fellow, and slays calves for his <span class="accented">food</span>." The method of kissing the hand in worship is attested by the derivation of the word <span class="accented">adore</span>, from <span class="accented">ad</span> and <span class="accented">os</span>; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a> we read of homage thus rendered: "<span class="accented">Or</span> my mouth hath kissed my hand: this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge." The Septuagint, (3, as if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> for <span class="accented">zobheche</span>,' and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e7;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, translate by, "They say, 'Sacrifice (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) men, for the calves have come to an end' [or, 'failed,' <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>]." "Thus," says Jerome, in explanation, "is shown the greed of demons, who are nourished on the blood of victims, that, when victims raft, they desire men to be sacrificed to them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-8 While Ephraim kept up a holy fear of God, and worshipped Him in that fear, so long he was very considerable. When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.</body></html>
