In the latter sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span>, to atone or suffer the punishment of contracted guilt; in the former sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;</span>, and it is translated accordingly by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;</span> in the LXX., and <span class="accented">pereat</span> by Jerome; so also Aben Ezra: "It shall be laid waste;" Kimchi: "The <span class="accented">aleph</span> has <span class="accented">seh'wa</span> alone, and the signification 'desolation,' and so the dwellers therein shall be made desolate." He thus intimates that <span class="accented">aleph</span>, having <span class="accented">sch'aa</span> alone without seghol, does not belong to the root, which is not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span> (for its future would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dd;</span>), but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. Rashi, however, understands it in the sense of "atone," or "find out her guiltiness;" he says, "From now will her guilt manifest itself." The reason of Samaria being thus mentioned is not only that it was the capital of the northern kingdom, but, as Kimchi says, "it confirmed Israel in the worship of the calves; for if the kings had been good, they would have brought back Israel to what was good." The <span class="accented">ki</span> assigns the reason of Samaria's desolation or guilt; it was rebellion against Jehovah, for Samaria was the seat and center of idolatry, and hence it spread throughout the land. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</span> The destruction thus described was to be complete. The present population would perish by the sword; the future progeny would be extinguished and all posterity cut off. Not only the children already born, but those unborn, were devoted to destruction; and all this in the most savage and barbarous manner. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, to meddle, gratify one's self, indulge one's caprice) presents childhood on the side of playfulness or petulance. The pronominal suffix attached to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span> refers to the city; and the feminine noun itself, forming subject to verbs in the masculine, arises from the fact that the feminine of the imperfect plural becomes rarer; or because the feminine plural only gradually distinguishes itself by a peculiar form from the masculine. The cruelties here specified may have been occasioned by those of the same kind with which Menahem King of Samaria smote Tiphsah. On that occasion "all the women therein that were with child he ripped up" (compare, for the cruel practice, 'Iliad,' 6:58; ,<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a> and 2 Kings 15:16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but he could not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.</body></html>
