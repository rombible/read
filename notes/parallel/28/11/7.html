With all their sinfulness and shortcomings, Israel was still the people of God - my <span class="accented">people</span>; they were guilty of the sin of backsliding, and of backsliding from God, the best of benefactors and their chief good. Nor was it occasionally and after long intervals of time that they backslided; it was their habit, their tendency. They were suspended on, or rather fastened on, backsliding. <span class="cmt_word">Though they called them to the Most High, none at all would exalt him</span>; margin, <span class="accented">together they exalted him not</span>. This second clause signifies either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the prophets called Israel from their idols to the Host High, yet none exalted him (literally, "together they did not or would not exalt him") by abandoning their idols and abstaining from backsliding; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "though they call him (Israel) upwards, yet not one of them all will lift himself up," that is, they together - one and all - refused or neglected to lift themselves upward towards God or goodness. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, so that it signifies, according to Keil, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "suspended," "hung up, hanging fast upon," "impaled on; ' Hengstenberg, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "swaying about from inconstancy," and "in danger of falling away;" but Pusey seems to combine both in the original sense of the word, and explains it as follows: "Literally, hung to it! as we say, 'a man's whole being <span class="accented">hangs</span> on a thing.' A thing <span class="accented">hung to</span> or on another sways to and fro within certain limits, but its relation to that on which it is hung remains immovable, Its power of motion is restrained within these limits. So Israel, so the sinner, however he veer to and fro in the details and circumstances of his sin, is fixed and immovable in his adherence to his sin itself." Though Rashi and the Targum of Jonathan make <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;</span> as synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;</span>, thus: "When the prophets teach them to return to me, they are in suspense whether <span class="accented">to return</span> or not to return; with difficulty do they return to me," - they are, however, distinguished as turning away from and turning to <span class="accented">God - aversion frets</span> anal <span class="accented">conversion to him</span>; while the suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span> is objective, that is, "My people are hung to apostatizing from me." The phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is variously interpreted, by some as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "upwards," the prophets being the subject; thus Rashi: "To the matter that is above him (Israel) the prophets call him unitedly; but my people do not lift themselves up nor desire to do it." Corruption was so deeply seated in Israel, that the idle mass gave no response to the voice of the prophets urging them upwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi both take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> as an adjective, and synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, the Most High. Kimchi explains as follows: "He says, My people oscillate between distress and freedom; sometimes distress comes upon them, and again they are in the condition of freedom, and this takes place for their <span class="accented">backsliding</span> from me, as if he said, because of the backsliding and rebellion which they practice against me... The prophets call them constantly to return to <span class="accented">God most high</span>." So Aben Ezra: "The interpretation is, the callers call him <span class="accented">to the Most High</span>, and they are the prophets of God; but they all in one way raise not the head." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome takes it for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, a yoke, and renders accordingly: "But a yoke shall be imposed on them together, that is not taken away." The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;</span> signifies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to Gesenius and many others, "to celebrate with praises," or "extol." It is rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "to lift one's self up," "rise upwards;" nor is it necessary with this sense to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;</span>, his head, with Grotius, nor yet to understand it written for or in the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, with Joseph Kimchi. Similarly the Syriac: "They call him to God, but they think together, conspire, and do not raise themselves." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d3;</span> is "all together," and therefore <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> is "no one." The LXX. translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the second clause as follows: "But God shall be angry with his precious things, and shall not at all exalt <span class="accented">him</span>," having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-7 When Israel were weak and helpless as children, foolish and froward as children, then God loved them; he bore them as the nurse does the sucking child, nourished them, and suffered their manners. All who are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God to them in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them, not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When they were in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the way of his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel are all thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this word signifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdens they had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God's counsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them. They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. They backslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with every temptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those only are truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by his power, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away the love and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast of the gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.</body></html>
