It suggests a hint of Divine mercy in its greatness, and of Divine justice too, which shows how, both being alike infinite, they can adjust themselves beyond the power of human experience and imagination.<p><span class= "bld">The Holy One in the midst of thee </span>is such a blending of justice and mercy.<p><span class= "bld">I will not enter into the city</span>.--So ancient versions. "Enter"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as a destroyer. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm" title="And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.">Hosea 11:6</a>.) But many commentators interpret the Hebrew <span class= "ital">b'ir</span> ("into the city") to mean <span class= "ital">in wrath.</span> This is preferable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim.</span> The promise of this verse is in harmony with the spirit of compassion expressed in the preceding. It is at once the effect and evidence of that feeling of Divine compassion. God would neither execute the burning heat of his wrath, for so the words literally mean, nor destroy Ephraim utterly, or again any more as formerly. The historic event referred to may be the destruction effected by Tiglath-pileser, ally of Ahaz King of Judah against Pekah King of Israel and Rezin King of Syria, when he carried away captive the inhabitants of Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>, "In the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazer, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria." But while this is probably the primary allusion, there is an ulterior reference to the future restoration of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">For I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city</span> (or, <span class="accented">come into bumming wrath</span>, Keil). A reason is here assigned for the exercise of the Divine com<span class="accented">miseration</span> just expressed; this reason is God's covenant of everlasting love. He is God, and must be measured by a Divine standard - not man, implacable and revengeful; though his people's provocation had been grievous, God was in the midst of them as their God, long-suffering and steadfast to his covenant of love and purposes of mercy. He would not enter <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> into the city as an enemy, and for the purpose of utter destruction, as he had entered into the cities of the plain for their entire and final ruin; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> if the alternative rendering be preferred, he would not come into burning wrath. The fiery heat or fierceness of God's wrath tends to destruction, not the amendment of the impenitent. The expression, "I will not return," may also be understood as equivalent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "I will not turn from my pity and promises;" or, "I will not turn away from Israel;" but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it suits the context better to translate on the principle of two verbs expressing one idea in a modified sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will not return to destroy," that is, "I will not again destroy Ephraim." Jerome's explanation favors the first, and is, "I will not act according to the fury of my anger, nor change from my clemency to destroy Ephraim; for I do not strike to destroy for ever, but to amend... for I am God and not man. Man punishes for this purpose of destroying; God chastises for the purpose of amending." As God, his purpose of mercy was changeless; as the Holy One in Israel, he was infinitely pure and absolutely perfect, "the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning." The meaning <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> already given of coming into the city is supported by ancient versions, Hebrew expositors, and some of the ablest Christian commentators; yet <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> we prefer that which understands <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> in the sense of "the heat of wrath," deriving it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span> effervescence, which is that given in Keil's translation. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> an explanation strongly advocated by Bishop Lowth and adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller. It is as follows in the words of the bishop: "Jerome is almost singular in his explanation: 'I am not one of those who inhabit cities; who live according to human laws; who think cruelty justice.' Castalio follows Jerome. There is, in fact, in the latter member of the sentence, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, a parallelism and synonym to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> in the former. The future <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> has a frequentative power (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a> and 8), 'I am not accustomed to enter a city: I am not an inhabitant of a city.' For there is a beautiful opposition of the different parts: 'I am God, and not man.' This is amplified in the next line, and the antithesis a little varied: ' I am thy God, inhabiting with thee, but in a peculiar and extraordinary manner, not in the manner of men.' Nothing, I think, can be plainer or more elegant than this." The bishop's rendering of the whole verse is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I will not do according to the fervent of my wrath,<br />I will not return to destroy Ephraim:<br />For I am God, and not man;<br />Holy in the midst of thee, though I inhabit not thy cities."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:8-12 God is slow to anger, and is loth to abandon a people to utter ruin, who have been called by his name. When God was to give a sacrifice for sin, and a Saviour for sinners, he spared not his own Son, that he might spare us. This is the language of the day of his patience; but when men sin that away, then the great day of his wrath comes. Man's compassions are nothing in comparison with the tender mercies of our God, whose thoughts and ways, in receiving returning sinners, are as much above ours as heaven is above the earth. God knows how to pardon poor sinners. He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and therein declares his righteousness, now Christ has purchased the pardon, and he has promised it. Holy trembling at the word of Christ will draw us to him, not drive us from him, the children tremble, and flee to him. And all that come at the gospel call, shall have a place and a name in the gospel church. The religious service of Israel were mere hypocrisy, but in Judah regard was had to God's laws, and the people followed their pious forefathers. Let us be faithful: those who thus honour God, he will honour, but such us despise Him shall be lightly esteemed.</body></html>
