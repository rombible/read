The <span class="accented">cords of a man</span> are such as parents use in leading weak or young children. <span class="accented">Bands of lore</span> qualify more closely the preceding expression, "cords of a man," and are the opposite of those which men employ in taming or breaking wild and unmanageable animals. The explanation of Rashi is similar: "I have always led them with tender cords such as these with which a man leads his child, as if he said with loving guidance." Aben Ezra and Kimchi, in their explanations, carry out more fully the same idea. The former says, "The bands of love are not like the bands which are fastened on the neck of a plowing heifer;" the latter, "Because he compared Ephraim to a heifer, and people lead a heifer with cords, he says, 'I have led Israel by the cords of a man, and not the cords of a heifer which one drags along with resistance, but as a man draws his fellow-man without compelling him to go with resistance: even so I have led them after a gentle method;' and therefore he afterward calls them (cords of a man) bands of love." The LXX., taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, in the sense of" injure," "destroy," have the mistaken rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, "When men were destroyed I drew them." The other Greek versions have the correct rendering. <span class="cmt_word">And I was to them as they that take off the yoke.</span> The word <span class="accented">herim</span> does not mean "to lift up on" and so "impose a yoke," as some think, nor "to take away the yoke," but "to lift it up." The figure is that of a humane and compassionate husbandman raising upwards or pushing backwards the yoke over the cheeks or dewlaps of the ox, that it may not press too heavily upon him or hinder him while eating. The reference is, according to Kimchi, to "taking the yoke off the neck, and letting it hang on the jaw, that it may not pull but rest from labor one or more hours of the day." The fact thus figuratively expressed is, not the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, but the loving-kindness of Jehovah in lightening the fulfillment of the Law to Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. omit the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, yoke, and strangely translates the clause, "I will be to them as a man smiting (another) on the cheeks." <span class="cmt_word">And I laid meat unto them.</span> The older and many modern interpreters, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> as the first person future apoc., Hiph., from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d8;&#x5d7;</span>, translate, "And I reached them food to eat," namely, the manna in the wilderness. This would require <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, which some substitute for the present reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald, Keil, and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d8;</span> as an adverb in the sense of" gradually," "gently," translating, "And gently towards him did I give him feral," or "I gently fed him." Some, again, as Kimchi, take <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> as a noun, after the form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>; and others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> take it to be an anomalous form for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, the first person future Hiph., like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-8.htm">Jeremiah 46:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In this clause also the Septuagint, probably reading as follows: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, translates, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I will have respect to him; I will prevail with him." Continuing the several clauses of this verse, we may express the meaning of the whole as follows: "Cords of a man" denote humane methods which Jehovah employed in dealing with and drawing his people - not such cords as oxen or other animals are drawn by; while "bands of love" is a kindred expression, explaining and emphasizing the former, and signifying such leading-strings as those with which a parent lovingly guides his child. The means employed by God for the help, encouragement, and support of his people were kind as they were bountiful. His benevolent and beneficent modes of procedure are further exhibited by another figure of like origin; for just as a considerate and compassionate man, a humane husbandman, gives respite and relief to the oxen at work by loosening the yoke and lifting it up off the neck upon the cheeks; and thus affords not only temporary rest and ease, but also allows an occasional mouthful or more of food, or even abundant provender, to the animal which toils in the yoke while plowing or at other work; so Jehovah extended to Israel, notwithstanding their frequent acts of unfaithfulness, his sparing mercy and tender compassions, supplying them in abundant measure with all that they needed for the sustenance and even comforts of life. Thus their sin in turning aside to other gods, which were no gods, in quest of larger benefits and more liberal support and succor, was all the more inexcusable. The next three verses (5-7) describe the severe chastisement Israel incurred by ingratitude for, and contempt of, the Divine love. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-7 When Israel were weak and helpless as children, foolish and froward as children, then God loved them; he bore them as the nurse does the sucking child, nourished them, and suffered their manners. All who are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God to them in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them, not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When they were in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the way of his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel are all thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this word signifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdens they had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God's counsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them. They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. They backslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with every temptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those only are truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by his power, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away the love and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast of the gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.</body></html>
