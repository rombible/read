The unwillingness to recognise the Divine Hand in "creation," "literature," "history" takes the opposed forms of Pantheism and Pyrrhonism. To each of these the prophet's words apply.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I taught Ephraim also to fro, taking them by their alms; but they knew not that I healed them.</span> This picture of God's guiding and guarding care of Ephraim is very touching and tender. It is that of an affectionate parent or tender nurse teaching a child to walk by leading-strings; taking it up in the arms when stumbling or making a false step; and in case it fell curing the wound. Thus, nurse-like, God taught Ephraim, his wayward perverse child, to use his feet (so the original word imports), all the while lending considerate help and seasonable aid. He took them by the hand to guide them, that they might not stray; he took them in his arms to hold them up, that they might not stumble and to help them over any obstacle that might lie in the way; and when, left to themselves during a short season, and in order to test their strength, they did stumble and fall, he healed their hurt. And yet they did not apprehend nor appreciate God's gracious design and dealings with them in thus guiding and guarding them, and in healing their diseases both temporal and spiritual. There is, perhaps, an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee." This promise, it will be remembered, was vouchsafed immediately after the bitter waters of Marah had been sweetened by the tree which, according to Divine direction, had been cast therein. Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">And</span> they have not acknowledged that I healed them of every sickness and every affliction, as he said, 'I will put none of these diseases upon thee.'" The reference is rather to all those evidences of his love which God manifested to them during their forty years' wandering in the wilderness; or perhaps to his guidance of them by 'his Law throughout their entire history. Rashi remarks that "they knew it very well, but dissembled [literally, 'trod it down with the heel,' equivalent to 'despised'] and acted, as if they did not know." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is properly taken both by Kimchi and Gesenius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>; the former says; "The <span class="accented">tar</span> stands in place of <span class="accented">he:</span> this is the opinion of the grammarians;" the latter regards it as a solitary example of Tiphel; others again consider it a corrupt reading instead of the ordinary form of Hiph. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some take it for a noun, as J. Kimchi, who says it is "a noun after the form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>, and although the word is Milel (while in <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> it is Milra), yet it is the same form;" thus the translation is, "As for me, my guidance was to Ephraim;" so Jerome, "I have been as a nurse to Ephraim;" likewise also Cyril. The former explanation is simpler and also otherwise preferable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint has the incorrect rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "I bound the feet of Ephraim," which Jerome explains, "I bound the feet of Ephraim that they might not fly further from me," though his own rendering is that given above. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span> has also occasioned some difficulty and consequent diversity of explanation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some explain it to be an infinitive construct equivalent to the Latin gerund indo, as elsewhere. Thus in the Authorized Version it is "taking them by their arms;' but the common form of the infinitive of this verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; besides, the suffixes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> are contradictory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Olshausen and Ewald read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> in the first person, the received text having, according to the latter, maintained its place only through <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>; but this is conjectural and wants manuscript authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Still worse is Abarbanel's interpretation, who understands the subject of the verb and the suffix of the noun as referring to Ephraim; thus: "He (Ephraim) took them (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the idols) on his arms." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The correct explanation, as we think, is that of Kimchi and Gesenius, who take the verb for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> by a not unusual aphaeris of the <span class="accented">lamed:</span> "He took them in his arms," the transition from the first to the third person being justified by the pictorially descriptive style of the passage. The following comment of Kimchi is worthy of attention: "The prophet only mentions Ephraim (instead of all Israel), because it was he that made the calves. He says, 'And how does Ephraim reward me for this that I bestowed on them so many benefits, and accustomed them to go on their feet, and did not burthen them with my commandments and my service?' And because he has compared Ephraim to a boy, he uses the word, 'I led them by strings.' Just as one leads a boy that he may accustom himself to go little by little without trouble, so I led them from station to station, when I brought them out of Egypt; I led them gradually without overexertion, the cloud going before them by day, and the pillar of fire by night." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-7 When Israel were weak and helpless as children, foolish and froward as children, then God loved them; he bore them as the nurse does the sucking child, nourished them, and suffered their manners. All who are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God to them in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them, not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When they were in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the way of his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel are all thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this word signifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdens they had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God's counsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them. They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. They backslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with every temptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those only are truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by his power, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away the love and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast of the gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.</body></html>
