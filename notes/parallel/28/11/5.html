The power of Assyria would be paramount; instead, therefore, of native kings and Egyptian auxiliaries, Israel would have to submit to that iron yoke. However desirous of returning to Egypt, they would have neither the power nor the privilege of doing so. And this poor privilege of a choice of masters they were refused as a just retribution, because they had not repented of their sin and returned to God. Various methods have been resorted to, to harmonize the apparent contradiction alluded to, that is, between the affirmative and negative statements about Israel's return into Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Dathe, Eichhorn, and De Wette agree with the LXX. in reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, and connecting it with the preceding verse; but the other versions, as well as the manuscripts, support the received text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome and Rosenm&uuml;ller explain it of the people's desire to conclude an alliance with Egypt in order to throw off the yoke of Assyria, being frustrated by the superior power of the latter; thus the sense is that they shall not return any more to Egypt, as they had lately done by their ambassadors, to seek help from that land or its people. Then he assigns the reason why they would not again send ambassadors to Egypt for the purpose indicated, because the Assyrian alone would be their king. The objection to this is that <span class="accented">lo yashubu</span> must refer to the whole people rather than to their ambassador going to and fro between the countries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ewald, Maurer, and others cut the knot by taking <span class="accented">lo</span> interrogatively, as if it were <span class="accented">halo</span>, and thus equivalent to an affirmative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">Shall</span> they not return to Egypt and the Assyrian be their king?" The expected answer would be in the affirmative. Neither grammar nor context sanctions this interrogative sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> According to Hitzig, Keil, Simson, and others, we are to understand Egypt in the previous places, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, as <span class="accented">received</span> of the land of bondage, where in the present passage the typical sense is inadmissible, owing to the contrast with Assyria. Into Egypt Israel should not return, lest the object of the Exodus might seem frustrated, but a worse lot lay before them - another and harder bondage awaited them; the King of Assyria would be their king and reign over them, and all because of their impenitence and refusal to return to Jehovah. The following is the explanation of Kimchi: "They should not have returned to the land of Egypt to seek help; I had already said to them, 'Ye shall henceforth return no more that way;' for if they had returned to me, they would not have needed help from Egypt. And against their will Assyria rules over them, and they serve him and send him a present year by year. And why is all this? Because they refused, etc.; as if he said (they refused) to return to me; for if they had returned to me, foreign kings (literally, 'kings of the nations') would not have ruled ever them, but they would have ruled over the nations as they had done in the days of David and Solomon, when they did my will; and so have I assured them, 'Thou shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.'" The root of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span> is cognate with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5e2;</span>, to hold back, refuse; the <span class="accented">le</span> strengthens the connection of the objectival infinitive with the governing verb; the ellipsis of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;</span> is obvious. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-7 When Israel were weak and helpless as children, foolish and froward as children, then God loved them; he bore them as the nurse does the sucking child, nourished them, and suffered their manners. All who are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God to them in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them, not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When they were in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the way of his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel are all thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this word signifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdens they had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God's counsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them. They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. They backslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with every temptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those only are truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by his power, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away the love and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast of the gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.</body></html>
