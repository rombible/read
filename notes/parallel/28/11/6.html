A more accurate rendering would be, <span class="accented">and the sword shall sweep round in its cities, and destroy its bolts and</span> devour. Nay, they could not free themselves from invasion and attack. The sword of war would whirl down upon their cities and consume the branches, that is, the villages, or the city bars, or the strong warriors set for defense. Some understand the word so variously interpreted in the sense of "liars," and refer it to the prophets, priests, and politicians who spake falsehood and. acted deceitfully. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;</span> is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "the sword," as the principal weapon in ancient warfare and the symbol of war's destructive power shall <span class="accented">sweep round in</span>, circulate, or make the round of the cities of Israel; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> others," whirl down," "light on ;" thus both Rashi and Kimchi. Again, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is, as already intimated, variously rendered. The most appropriate translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> is (literally, "<span class="accented">poles</span> for carrying the ark," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13</a>) "<span class="accented">bolts</span> or bars" for securing gates, the root being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;</span>, to separate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Some explain it as a figure for "<span class="accented">mighty</span> men;" so Jerome and the Targum, as also Rashi: "It destroys his heroes and consumes them." this is the meaning of the word preferred by Gesenius. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Ewald understands it in the sense of "fortresses," especially on the frontier, by which a land is shut against or opened to the enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi take it to mean "branches," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> villages, and are followed by the Authorized Version. "The explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>," <span class="accented">says</span> Kimchi, "is ' branches,' and it is a figure for villages, for he had already mentioned his cities; and villages are related to cities as branches to a tree; in like manner they are called ' daughters,' being related to a city as daughters to a mother." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The LXX. render it by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, as also the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">Because of their own counsels</span>. The cause of all their calamitous invasions, which city gates barred and bolted could not shut out, was their evil counsels in departing from the Lord, as Kimchi correctly explains: "All this comes upon them in consequence of their evil counsel, because they have forsaken my service to serve other gods." Rashi draws attention to the peculiarity of the accentuation - tasha and sellug - to separate it from the preceding word. The Septuagint here again blunders, obviously reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and translating, "And shall eat (the fruit) of their evil counsel." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-7 When Israel were weak and helpless as children, foolish and froward as children, then God loved them; he bore them as the nurse does the sucking child, nourished them, and suffered their manners. All who are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God to them in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them, not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When they were in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the way of his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel are all thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this word signifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdens they had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God's counsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them. They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. They backslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with every temptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those only are truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by his power, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away the love and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast of the gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.</body></html>
