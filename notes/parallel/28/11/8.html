On the darkest cloud gleams the bow of promise. A nation so much beloved as Israel cannot be destroyed by Him who has fostered it so tenderly. As the prophet loved his faithless bride, so Jehovah continued to love His people. The "how?" of this verse expresses the most extreme reluctance. Admah and Zeboim were cities of the plain destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah, which are often referred to as the type of irremediable catastrophe. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm" title="Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm" title="And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-15.htm" title="Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.">Matthew 10:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Mine heart is turned within me</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">against</span> me--a violent revulsion of feeling. Divine compassion pleads with Divine justice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim?</span> This verse paves the way for transition to promise. Although the Israelites on account of such conduct had merited complete annihilation, yet Jehovah, for his love and mercy's sake, substitutes grace for justice, and will not destroy them from off the face of the earth. One rendering <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> gives the clause the turn of an exclamation rather than of an interrogation; thus: "How readily and justly could I [or should I, or how thoroughly could I if I punished thy rebellion as I deserved] give thee up to destruction!" We prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the ordinary rendering, by which it is treated as a question: "How shall I give thee up to the power of the enemy, and not only that, but destroy thee?" Calvin's exposition seems indeed to favor the former: "Here," he says, "God consults what he is to do with the people; and first, indeed, he shows that it was his purpose to execute vengeance such as the Israelites deserved, even wholly to destroy them; but yet he assumes the character of one deliberating, that none might think that he hastily fell into anger, or that, being soon excited by excessive fury, he devoted to ruin those who had lightly sinned, or were guilty of no great crimes By these expressions of the text God shows what the Israelites deserved, and that he was now inclined to inflict the punishment of which they were worthy, and yet not without repentance, or at least not without hesitation. He afterwards adds in the next clause, <span class="accented">This I will not do</span>; <span class="accented">my heart is within me changed</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together</span>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, literally, "upon," "with," then, "in," or "within:" "My heart is turned or changed from anger to pity in me." The expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, signifies, according to Rashi, "one <span class="accented">warmed</span>," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>, where this same word is rendered in the Authorized Version," yearned:" "His bowels did yearn upon his brother," or "warmed towards." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> many modern interpreters understand the word in the sense of" gathering themselves together:" "<span class="accented">The</span> feelings of compassion gathered themselves together;" <span class="accented">nichumim</span>, from Piel <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, a noun of the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, less definite than <span class="accented">rachamim</span>, bowels, as the seat of the emotions, "<span class="accented">gathered</span> themselves together," or "were excited all at once." The cities of the plain included Admah and Zeboim, Sodom and Gomorrah, all of which, in consequence of their sins, were overthrown and perished in one common calamity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> these cities are all named, though Admah and Zeboim are not mentioned by name in the narrative of the catastrophe contained in Genesis. Though Israel had been as guilty and deserving of wrath as these, God expresses strong reluctance to deliver them over into the hands and power of their enemies, or to give them up to destruction. His heart revolted at the thought, and turned aside from the fierceness of his anger, though so fully deserved, into the direction of mercy; a new turn was given to his feelings in the direction of compassion. All his relentings or repentings together - one and all - yearned or were at once aroused. Repenting on the part of God is an expression suited to human comprehension, implying no change of purpose on the side of God, but only a change of procedure consistent with his purpose of everlasting love. "The Law speaks in the language of the sons of men." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:8-12 God is slow to anger, and is loth to abandon a people to utter ruin, who have been called by his name. When God was to give a sacrifice for sin, and a Saviour for sinners, he spared not his own Son, that he might spare us. This is the language of the day of his patience; but when men sin that away, then the great day of his wrath comes. Man's compassions are nothing in comparison with the tender mercies of our God, whose thoughts and ways, in receiving returning sinners, are as much above ours as heaven is above the earth. God knows how to pardon poor sinners. He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and therein declares his righteousness, now Christ has purchased the pardon, and he has promised it. Holy trembling at the word of Christ will draw us to him, not drive us from him, the children tremble, and flee to him. And all that come at the gospel call, shall have a place and a name in the gospel church. The religious service of Israel were mere hypocrisy, but in Judah regard was had to God's laws, and the people followed their pious forefathers. Let us be faithful: those who thus honour God, he will honour, but such us despise Him shall be lightly esteemed.</body></html>
