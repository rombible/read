The rest of the verse in the LXX. is amplified: "And the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the heaven, and the creeping things of the earth shall devour them." While no candid critic will deny the possibility that such words may have originally stood in the text, it is <span class= "ital">a priori</span> more probable that it is a gloss from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm" title="And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.">Hosea 2:18</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm" title="I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness: and you shall know the LORD.">Hosea 2:20</a> in LXX.). Even so late as in Hadrian's days wild beasts rushed in upon the blood-stained ruins of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will destroy</span> (<span class="accented">make desolate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>her vines and her fig trees, whereof she said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me.</span> God had already threatened to deprive Israel of the means of support - the corn, wine, wool, and flax; he now threatens the removal of the very sources whence that support was derived. The vine and fig tree are usually conjoined, and by a common synecdoche convey the idea of all those sources that combine to support life and supply its luxuries. When the united kingdom of Judah and Israel, before the disruption, had obtained the zenith of prosperity in the reign of Solomon, it is thus expressed: Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon." Yet Israel knew not the time of her merciful visitation, and not only turned aside to idols, but most stupidly and most inexcusably attributed the many mercies she enjoyed to the idols which she worshipped. Like a foul adulteress despising the tokens of her husband's affection and delighting in the rewards of lewdness received from licentious paramours, Israel forfeited all her privileges, and forced the Lord to withdraw his bounties and destroy their very source. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5e4;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, to be bent, from the arch made by its drooping boughs, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5df;</span>, to extend from its length. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span> The places where fig trees flourished and vines abounded shall be stripped of those trees, with their pleasant fruits - shall become a forest. The vineyards being no longer hedged or fenced, no longer cultivated or cared for, the beasts of the field shall, in consequence, find free ingress and roam there at large, devouring and devastating at pleasure. The Septuagint translates the first part of the above sentence by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "and I will make them a testimony," thus reading, according to Jerome, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;</span>; while Cyril comments on the words so read as follows: "For these things being taken away shall testify as it were against Israel's depravity, and render their punishment more signal, and make the wrath conspicuous." The context, however, militates against the reading in question, for in time of war or general devastation places, through neglect, grow trees and brushwood, where wild beasts lair and lay waste. The explanation of the verse is well given by Kimchi in his commentary: "Because she said, 'These are the hire of my harlotry;' because she said that from the hand of her lovers came the corn and must and oil and all good things; - I will make them a desolation, that she may know whether she had those good things from me or from them. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, because he has compared her to a harlot, he calls those good things <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>; while their signification is identical with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>, and their root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> [extend, reach, give], the aleph being prosthetic. But Jonathan renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, precious things. And he mentions the vine and the fig tree because grapes and figs are the best part of the food of man after the produce of the earth (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. corn); and already he had said, 'I will also take away my corn in its season.'" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-13 God threatens what he would do with this treacherous, idolatrous people. They did not turn, therefore all this came upon them; and it is written for admonition to us. If lesser difficulties be got over, God will raise greater. The most resolute in sinful pursuits, are commonly most crossed in them. The way of God and duty is often hedged about with thorns, but we have reason to think it is a sinful way that is hedged up with thorns. Crosses and obstacles in an evil course are great blessings, and are to be so accounted; they are God's hedges, to keep us from transgressing, to make the way of sin difficult, and to keep us from it. We have reason to bless God for restraining grace, and for restraining providences; and even for sore pain, sickness, or calamity, if it keeps us from sin. The disappointments we meet with in seeking for satisfaction from the creature, should, if nothing else will do it, drive us to the Creator. When men forget, or consider not that their comforts come from God, he will often in mercy take them away, to bring them to think upon their folly and danger. Sin and mirth can never hold long together; but if men will not take away sin from their mirth, God will take away mirth from their sin. And if men destroy God's word and ordinances, it is just with him to destroy their vines and fig-trees. This shall be the ruin of their mirth. Taking away the solemn seasons and the sabbaths will not do it, they will readily part with them, and think it no loss; but He will take away their sensual pleasures. Days of sinful mirth must be visited with days of mourning.</body></html>
