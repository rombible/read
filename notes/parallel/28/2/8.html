Gold was largely imported from Ophir (probably the west coast of India, where Tamil is spoken: Delitzsch, <span class= "ital">Genesis,</span> pp. 258-9. On the other hand, Fried. Delitzsch, in his work on the <span class= "ital">Site of Paradise,</span> p. 99, holds that Ophir was a coast or island between the north end of the Persian Gulf and the south-west corner of Arabia). Silver was obtained from Tarshish, through Ph?nician markets. Observe that Israel at this time abounded in the possession of precious metals.

Here we have an account of her ignorance of, and ingratitude to, the true and or of her mercies, together with her sinful misuse and sad abuse of those mercies. The products of the earth which God bestowed on her were corn and wine and oil - all that was needed for food, refreshment, and even luxury; the prosperity in trade or commerce with which he favored her resulted in the multiplied increase of silver and gold. The perversion of these blessings consisted in her employment of them in the service of Baal or of idolatry in general. The sin of refusing to acknowledge the Author of such manifold mercies was grievously augmented by this gross abuse of them. The last clause is a relative one, <span class="accented">asher</span>, as frequently being understood; while the words <span class="accented">asu labbaal</span> do not signify that they made those metals into images of Baal, as implied in the Authorized Version; nor vet that they offered them to Baal according to Gesenius; but that they prepared or employed them in the worship of that idol and the service of idolatry in general. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d4;</span>, to cover, multiply, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. multitude and plenty covering ever everything; comp. <span class="accented">tego</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, take possession of the brain in intoxicating: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine. Kimchi remarks as follows: "All the goodness in the possession of which she was, she had not except from me; because I sent my blessing on the corn and wine and oil, and sent my blessing upon the work of their hands, so that they had abundance of silver and gold; but Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-13 God threatens what he would do with this treacherous, idolatrous people. They did not turn, therefore all this came upon them; and it is written for admonition to us. If lesser difficulties be got over, God will raise greater. The most resolute in sinful pursuits, are commonly most crossed in them. The way of God and duty is often hedged about with thorns, but we have reason to think it is a sinful way that is hedged up with thorns. Crosses and obstacles in an evil course are great blessings, and are to be so accounted; they are God's hedges, to keep us from transgressing, to make the way of sin difficult, and to keep us from it. We have reason to bless God for restraining grace, and for restraining providences; and even for sore pain, sickness, or calamity, if it keeps us from sin. The disappointments we meet with in seeking for satisfaction from the creature, should, if nothing else will do it, drive us to the Creator. When men forget, or consider not that their comforts come from God, he will often in mercy take them away, to bring them to think upon their folly and danger. Sin and mirth can never hold long together; but if men will not take away sin from their mirth, God will take away mirth from their sin. And if men destroy God's word and ordinances, it is just with him to destroy their vines and fig-trees. This shall be the ruin of their mirth. Taking away the solemn seasons and the sabbaths will not do it, they will readily part with them, and think it no loss; but He will take away their sensual pleasures. Days of sinful mirth must be visited with days of mourning.</body></html>
