This would more easily account for the change of person ("your ". . . "their "), which is, however, very frequent in Hebrew prophecy. The next "for" introduces a parenthetical clause--"her lovers"<span class= "ital">--</span>a word used in a bad sense. The aggravation of her shame is that she seeks them, and not they her. She attributes to these idol-gods all those temporal benefits which theocratic history shows to have been Jehovah's gift, and the consequence of loyalty to Him. The modern analogue of this sin of Israel is the use of "Fortune," "Nature," "Destiny," "Impersonal Law," and even "Humanity," as the giver of all good things, as though it were superstitious or heretical to speak of God as the giver.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath dons shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers.</span> The charge of idolatry under the figure of harlotry, spiritual harlotry, is reiterated. "Mother" is repeated in and emphasized by the parallel words, "she that conceived them." A somewhat similar form of expression is that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>, "The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies." To <span class="accented">bosh</span>, to be ashamed, belong the Hiphil forms, <span class="accented">hebhish</span> and <span class="accented">hobhish</span> (the latter formed from <span class="accented">zabhish</span>), properly "to put to shame," but also "to practice shame or do shameful things." The nature of her shameful conduct is more definitely and distinctly expressed in the clauses which follow; and consisted of several particulars. There is the persistent pursuit of her lovers; then the unblushing boldness with which she avows her determination to continue that course; and next come her expectations from them. <span class="cmt_word">That give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink</span> (margin, <span class="accented">drinks</span>). The original word here rendered "lovers" is the Piel participle, which may have either its usual intensive sense or its occasional causative sense in which it is taken by Rosenm&uuml;ller, who has "a-mare me facientes," equivalent to "wooers." It matters little which way we understand it. The more important point is to determine who or what are here meant by lovers. Most commentators understand them to be those nations whose friendship Israel set such store by - the Assyrians and the Egyptians. Thus Grotius and Jerome, - the latter explains them of the Assyrians and Egyptians and other nations, with whose idols Israel committed fornication, and from which in distress they vainly hoped for help; so also Kimchi, in the following comment: "By 'friends ' he implies the Assyrians and Egyptians joined in alliance to the Israelites, who delivered them from their enemies, so that they lived safely, in return for the gifts (tribute) which they (the Israelites) were in the habit of giving them. And as they lived in tranquility in virtue of the compact entered into with them, the prophet represents it as if they supplied them with all the necessaries of life. For with their help they tilled their land without fear and in safety traded from country to country." Kimchi quotes at the same time his father's (Joseph Kimchi) interpretation: "But my lord my father of blessed memory explained 'after her lovers' of the sun and moon and stars, which they worshipped; while their intention was that they gave them their food and their sufficiency, as they said, 'But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.'" This exposition of Joseph Kimchi is much nearer the truth than that of his son David; it is, however, too restricted. The "lovers" were the idols on which the people of the northern kingdom so dented, and on which they placed so much dependence. The blessings which they vainly expected from these idols are enumerated: they were - food and raiment and luxuries; the bread and water were the articles of food as it is written elsewhere. "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure;" the wool and flax were the materials for clothing; while the oil and drinks were, the former for ornament, the latter for refresh-merit, and so included all luxuries; thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> anointest my head with oil;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>, "And mingled my drink [literally, 'drinks,' the same word, <span class="accented">shigguyar</span>] with weeping;" also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> we read of "wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthened man's heart." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 This chapter continues the figurative address to Israel, in reference to Hosea's wife and children. Let us own and love as brethren, all whom the Lord seems to put among his children, and encourage them in that they have received mercy. But every Christian, by his example and conduct, must protest against evil and abuses, even among those to whom he belongs and owes respect. Impenitent sinners will soon be stripped of the advantages they misuse, and which they consume upon their lusts.</body></html>
