Some prefer to render by <span class= "ital">nevertheless,</span> but the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">lakh?n</span> is sometimes used in making strong transitions, linked, it is true, with what precedes, but not as an inference. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:24</a>.)

The transition is abrupt. Vers. 14-17 exhibit the gradual change wrought in Israel through the progressive means of improvement employed by Jehovah. Israel's future is here reflected in the mirror of her past history. The events of that history are elegantly employed to represent as by type or symbol the mercies in store for Israel, wayward and rebellious though she had proved herself to be. <span class="accented">Laken</span> (from <span class="accented">le</span> causal, and <span class="accented">ken</span>, so, equivalent to "because it is so") at the beginning of this verse (14) is rendered by some, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "but" or "yet;" but its natural signification is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "therefore." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, Ionic <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, neuter <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, contracted <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>); it being so, therefore, and similar to the Latin phrase, <span class="accented">quae cum ita slut</span>, "therefore" implies because Israel can only be turned from her foolish idolatry by the penal measures named. Aben Ezra also understands it here, as elsewhere, in its literal sense; thus: "After she [the unchaste wife representative of Israel] shall know that all this evil has come upon her because that she had forgotten me, and had not known at the beginning that I dealt kindly with her; and when she will say, 'Yet will I go and return to my former husband;' then will I allure her with words." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5ea;&#x5d4;</span> is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5ea;</span> cognate with the Arabic in the sense of "dividing," "being open," "standing open;" thence it signifies "to be susceptible of outward impressions," "allow access and entrance;" in Piel, "to make one open.... be susceptible or inclined," "induce by words." The word <span class="accented">laken</span>, "therefore," has somewhat puzzled commentators, because the connection between the judgments threatened in the preceding verses and the mercies proffered in what follows is not to a superficial view at once apparent. Yet it is mercy and truth meeting together, righteousness and peace kissing each other. It is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the connecting link between the enormity of our sins and the greatness of the Divine mercy; between the vileness of our iniquities and the riches of Divine grace. In like manner the psalmist prays, "Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great;" and God promises by the prophet, "For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him; I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners." Long previously God had said, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth." The secret of such striking contrasts is that where sin abounded grace did much more abound. Egypt having been to Israel the house of bondage, the exodus from that land represents deliverance out of a servile, suffering condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The wilderness or Arabian desert into which they were brought on leaving that country was a place of <span class="accented">freedom</span>. They were emancipated, and breathed the free air of the wilderness; they were exercised with salutary <span class="accented">discipline</span> after their emancipation; as they traversed the wilderness they were trained and tried. The allurement which prefaces their deliverance refers to the persuasion of Moses and Aaron, who found it necessary to persuade and even coax their countrymen to turn their back on their bondage and follow the leaders whom God had sent them. The "comfortable words" mentioned in the clone of the verse were addressed to them at a subsequent period, when, allured out of the strange land where they had sojourned so long, they were led forth into the wilderness. The "comfortable words" comprehended both temporal and spiritual mercies - relief in every time of emergency, deliverance in danger and distress, a plentiful supply of their necessities, with pardon of their sins, assurances of grace, and renewed tokens of God's favor on repentance. A difficulty has been found in the words, "and bring her into the wilderness," being interposed between the alluring and the speaking comfortably. The difficulty is removed <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by translating <span class="accented">vav</span>, not by "and," but by "after," as if equivalent to <span class="accented">acher</span>; thus: "After I shall have brought her into the wilderness I wilt allure and comfort her." Then the meaning would be, "After I have humbled them thoroughly as I did their forefathers in the wilderness, then will I speak comfortably unto them." God humbled their forefathers in Egypt, yet that did not suffice; he humbled them afterwards in the wilderness, and then brought them into Canaan. Many times God sends successive <span class="accented">afflictions</span> upon his own people, to break their hearts, to humble them thoroughly, and at last "he speaks comfortably unto them." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the wilderness may be viewed in another light. Besides the distresses experienced in the wilderness, there were <span class="accented">deliverances</span> enjoyed. The reference here may be to the latter, and all the more as this part of the chapter deals with merciful providences. The particle <span class="accented">vav</span> and other words of the verse then retain their natural sense; and, instead of a denunciation of further afflictions, God declares to Israel that he will perform on their behalf such works of power, wisdom, and goodness, at once great and glorious, merciful and wonderful, as he had wrought for their forefathers in the wilderness after their deliverance from Egypt. Thus the Chaldee: "I will work miracles and great works of wonder for them, such as I wrought in the desert;" as though he said, "Whatever the condition may be into which you shall be brought, vet you shall have me working in as glorious a way for your good and comfort as ever I did for your forefathers when they were in the wilderness." The explanation of "wilderness" under number <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> above, combining, as it does, <span class="accented">deliverance</span> yet <span class="accented">discipline</span>, care yet chastisement, deserves the preference; it is neither to be explained with Keil exclusively in the sense of <span class="accented">promise</span>, nor, on the other hand, exclusively in the sense of <span class="accented">punishment</span> with Rashi, who comments as follows: "I will lead her into the wilderness, which for her is like a wilderness and a dry parched land; and there she shall lay it to heart that it was better with her when she did my will than when she rebelled against me." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-23 After these judgments the Lord would deal with Israel more gently. By the promise of rest in Christ we are invited to take his yoke upon us; and the work of conversion may be forwarded by comforts as well as by convictions. But usually the Lord drives us to despair of earthly joy, and help from ourselves, that, being shut from every other door, we may knock at Mercy's gate. From that time Israel would be more truly attached to the Lord; no longer calling him Baali, or My lord and master, alluding to authority, rather than love, but Ishi, an address of affection. This may foretell the restoration from the Babylonish captivity; and also be applied to the conversion of the Jews to Christ, in the days of the apostles, and the future general conversion of that nation; and believers are enabled to expect infinitely more tenderness and kindness from their holy God, than a beloved wife can expect from the kindest husband. When the people were weaned from idols, and loved the Lord, no creature should do them any harm. This may be understood of the blessings and privileges of the spiritual Israel, of every true believer, and their partaking of Christ's righteousness; also, of the conversion of the Jews to Christ. Here is an argument for us to walk so that God may not be dishonoured by us: Thou art my people. If a man's family walk disorderly, it is a dishonour to the master. If God call us children, we may say, Thou art our God. Unbelieving soul, lay aside discouraging thoughts; do not thus answer God's loving-kindness. Doth God say, Thou art my people? Say, Lord, thou art our God.</body></html>
