Joash prevailed over Amaziah, and plundered Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/14-12.htm" title="And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.">2Kings 14:12-14</a>). Jeroboam II. extended his power as far as Hamath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/14-23.htm" title="In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.">2Kings 14:23-25</a>). The kingdom had resisted the attacks of Syria, and had become insolent as well as idolatrous. The last clause should be rendered, <span class= "ital">The more abundant his fruit, the more he increased altars; the fairer his land, the fairer the Baal-pillars.</span> On "Baal-pillars," see W. R. Smith, <span class= "ital">Old Testament in the Jewish Church,</span> pp. 248, 425. (Comp. 9:1 and 2:5.) Misapprehending the cause of their temporal prosperity, and wilfully ignoring Jehovah's forbearance and love, they attributed their mercies to the grace of Baal, and multiplied idolatrous shrines (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm" title="Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?">Romans 2:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel is an empty vine</span>. The comparison of Israel to a vine is frequent; but the epithet <span class="accented">boqeq</span> is variously rendered; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as "empty." Thus Aben Ezra explains it as "empty in which there is no strength to bring forth fruit, nor fruit;" and thus also Kimchi explains it: "An empty vine in which there is not any life-sap;" and in the same sense <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, "empty and sick," <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>. This, too, is the meaning of the Authorized Version, but is irreconcilable with the statement in the following clause, "he bringeth forth fruit." The Chaldee had preceded in giving the word the sense of "plundered," "empty," "waste." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some take <span class="accented">boqeq</span> transitively, and attach to it the signification of "emptying out its fruit." In this way Rashi explains it: "The Israelites resemble a vine which casts all its good fruit;" and similarly the marginal rendering of the Authorized Version has, "a vine emptying the fruit which it giveth." There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a signification derivable from the primary meaning of <span class="accented">boqeq</span> more suitable than either of the preceding. From the primary sense of "pouring," "pouring itself out," or" poured out," and so overflowing, comes that of "luxuriant." Accordingly Gesenius translates, "a wide-spreading vine." This agrees with the <span class="accented">Septuagint</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "a vine with goodly branches," to which the Vulgate <span class="accented">frondosa</span>, "leafy," nearly corresponds. In like manner De Wette renders it <span class="accented">wuchernder</span>, "growing prosperously." It was thus a vine of vigorous growth, and extending its branches far and wide; a parallel expression is found in the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>, "a spreading vine." He (rather, <span class="accented">it</span>) bringeth forth fruit unto him self (<span class="accented">itself</span>). The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>literally signifies "reset to" or "on," and is rightly rendered by Gesenius "to set" or "yield fruit." It is variously interpreted by the Hebrew commentators, but more or less erroneously by them all. Rashi takes it in the sense of "to profit;" Aben Ezra, "to bear" or "make equal;" and Kimchi informs us that the older interpreters understood in the sense of "lying," as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, the whole phrase meaning, "the fruit will lie to him," that is, deceive or fail him (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>). Kimchi himself takes the verb in the right sense, but, misled by his erroneous explanation of <span class="accented">boqeq</span>, empty or plundered, takes the clause interrogatively: "How shall he set on himself [equivalent to 'yield' any fruit], since he is as a plundered vine; for the enemies have plundered him and set him as an empty vessel? how should he still thrive and become numerous in children and treasures?" It makes little difference whether we take the second part of the first clause relatively or independently, as the sense amounts to the same. The meaning of the two difficult and disputed words then we take to be respectively "luxuriant" and "yield;" and the sense of the whole is either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a comparison of the former state of Israel to a vine luxuriant and likely, as far as appearance went, to set forth fruit; but the luxuriance degenerated into leafage, and the likelihood of fruitage failed; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Israel is compared to a vine luxuriant in growth and abundant in fruit - but only <span class="accented">for itself</span>. The former explanation accords with that of Jerome when he <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">Unpruned</span> vines luxuriate in the juice and leaves which they ought to transmute into wine. They disperse in the idle ambitious show of leaves and branches." The more abundantly a fruit tree gives out its strength in leaves and branches, the less abundant and the worse the quality of the fruit. Thus it was with the fig tree, with its abundant leaves and no fruit, which our Lord cursed. But with the same or a similar rendering there is the alternative sense of prosperous growth and plenteous fruit, but that fruit wasted on self or sin; and thus the meaning in either case is much the same. The Septuagint favors this by <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "its fruit exuberant." Cyril favors this latter also in saying, "When Israel still wisely led a life in accordance with the Divine Law, it was as a beautiful vine adorned with branches, which even the neighboring nations admired." This was exactly the state of Israel in the days of Joash and Jeroboam II.; but their prosperity was prostituted to purposes of idolatry. Jerome also, in any other part of his exposition, approaches this sense. Taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>, in the sense of "<span class="accented">to equal</span>," he says, "The fecundity of the grapes equaled the fecundity of the branches: but they who had previously been so fruitful before they offended God, afterwards turned the abundance of fruits into multiplied occasions of offence; and the greater the population they possessed, the more altars they built, and exceeded the abundant produce of the land by the multitude of their idols." Or the verb may mean, "it made fruit equal to itself;" nearly so the Vulgate. The fruit is agreeable to it. <span class="cmt_word">According to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars.</span> In this second or middle clause of the verse the figure passes into the fact represented by it. It is no longer the vine, but Israel. The altars kept pace with the increase of population and abundant produce; the multiplication of altars for idolatrous sacrifice and service was proportionate to their prosperity. The <span class="accented">l'</span> here and in next clause marks the circumlocutory genitive, and the <span class="accented">ke</span> is quantitative. <span class="cmt_word">According to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images</span> (margin, <span class="accented">statues</span>, or, <span class="accented">standing images</span>). The <span class="accented">matstsevoth</span> here mentioned are <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., that is, statues or pillars, and those pillars were erected to Baal or some other idol, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. The plural of the verb in this last <span class="accented">clause</span> arises from Israel being a noun of multitude. Rashi gives the following brief exposition: "<span class="accented">Just</span> in proportion as I caused their prosperity to overflow to them, they multiplied calves for the altars;" but Kimchi explains both clauses more fully and accurately thus: "<span class="accented">As</span> I increased their prosperous state in treasures and children, they multiplied altars to Baal; as I did good to their land in corn and wine and oil, they waxed strong in setting up pillars for other gods;" the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;</span> has the same sense here as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d4;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-9.htm">Jonah 4:9</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity is but a collection of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water. Sinners will in vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they now despise as a Saviour.</body></html>
