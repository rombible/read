Here their wickedness is traced to its fountainhead; its source was in the corrupt state of the heart. Their heart was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> divided, and so they halted between two opinions - between the worship of Jehovah and idolatry. <span class="accented">Chalaq</span> is taken in this signification by the Chaldee, Syriac, Septuagint, and Jerome, as also by the Hebrew commentators. The LXX. have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the singular, which affords some support to Hitzig's rendering, "He (God)divided their heart," - but this is unsuitable and unscriptural; another <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> reading of the same version is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "They have divided their hearts," which is somewhat better, yet incorrect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The Authorized Version is also questionable, as the verb is not used intransitively in Qal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi, indeed, understands <span class="accented">chalaq</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">niehloq</span> in the Niphal, and interprets, "From the fear of God and from his Law their heart is divided," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. separated; similarly Rashi: "Their heart is divided from me;" Aben Ezra somewhat peculiarly, though to the same purport: "They (their heart) has not one part (but several),"or is divided. But, notwithstanding this consensus in favor of the meaning of "divide," the rendering preferred, and justly so, by modern expositors in general, is "smooth." This is, indeed, the primary sense, that of "divide" being secondary, as division was made by lot or a smooth stone, <span class="accented">cheleq</span>, used for the purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Their heart is <span class="accented">smooth</span>," that is, bland, deceitful, hypocritical; though it must be admitted that the word is mostly applied to the tongue, lip, throat, mouth, speech, and not to the heart. Their heart was hypocritical and faithless. <span class="cmt_word">Now shall they be found faulty</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they shall be dealt with as such</span>, or <span class="accented">punished</span>; better still, perhaps, is the rendering, <span class="accented">now shall they atone</span>. The "<span class="accented">now"</span> defines sharply the turning-point between God's love and God's wrath. The state of things hitherto existing cannot continue; it must soon come to an end. Ere long they are doomed to discover their guilt in its punishment; they shall find out their sin by suffering; suddenly and to their cost they shall have a fearful awaking to a sense of their iniquity by the inflictions of Divine wrath upon their guilty heads. <span class="cmt_word">He shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5e4;</span> is peculiar; being a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, the neck, it signifies "to break the neck of," like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, decollate, then figuratively "tear down," "break in pieces." This bold expression of breaking the neck of the altars may allude to their destruction by breaking off the horns of the altars, or rather to their beheading, cutting off the heads of victims at those altars. The Hebrew expositors make the heart of the people, not God, the immediate object of the verb. "<span class="accented">Their</span> heart," says one of them, "shall tear down their altars and lay waste their pillars, because it is divided from me. It will tear down their altars which they are said also to have multiplied, and lay waste their pillars which they made so goodly." The means of sinning shall be taken from them and destroyed - their altars broken down and their images spoiled. <span class="accented">As</span> the heads of victims had been cut off at these altars erected for idolatrous worship; so the heads of their altars would be broken off. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity is but a collection of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water. Sinners will in vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they now despise as a Saviour.</body></html>
