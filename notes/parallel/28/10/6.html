Here we have an explanation and confirmation of what has just been said in the preceding verse. The calf, the glorious and magnificent national god, as Israel considered it, is brought to Assyria, and there offered as a present to the Assyrian king. The word <span class="accented">gam</span> is emphatic; that is, "it also," "itself also," or "it also with men and other spoils" - the golden idol of Beth-aven. Kimchi's explanation of <span class="accented">gam</span> is as follows: "Genesis, extension or generalization of the term, refers to the glory he bad mentioned. He says, 'Lo, in its place the glory shall depart from it as soon as they shall break it. <span class="accented">Also</span>, the stump of the calf, namely, the gold thereon, after its form is broken, they shall take away as a present to King Jareb.'" The sign of the accusative with suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>, which here stands before a passive verb, may be taken either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> absolutely, "<span class="accented">as</span> to it also," "<span class="accented">it</span> shall be brought ;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as an instance of anacoluthon; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>, according to Gesenius, the passive may be regarded as an impersonal active, and thus it may take the object of the action in the accusative. The word <span class="accented">yubhal</span> is from <span class="accented">yabhal</span>, primarily used of flowing in a strong and violent stream, and so the root of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, the flood; then it signifies "to go," "to be brought or carried." The <span class="accented">minchah</span> here spoken of cannot well mean tribute, but is rather a gift of homage to the Assyrian conqueror, whom the prophet m vision sees already wasting the land of Israel and carrying away all its treasures and precious things. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span> The feminine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> - of which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>, the masculine, by analogy, is not in use - is wrongly explained by the Hebrew expositors as having a pleonastic <span class="accented">nun</span>. The construction usually preferred is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that given above. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others render it, "Shame shall seize Ephraim;" but tiffs constructs a feminine noun with a masculine verb, contrary to grammar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hitzig translates," He (the Assyrian king) shall take away or carry off the shame of Ephraim; that <span class="accented">is</span>, the calf-idol." He remarks that the construct feminine does not always in the speech of North Israel end in <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5ea;</span>, and cites several passages in proof. The <span class="accented">counsel</span> of which Israel would be ashamed is understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the consultation held before making a covenant or treaty with the King of Assyria; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is generally and more correctly understood of Jeroboam taking counsel with his tribesmen of Ephraim about setting up the calf idols. Jareb is a proper name, or rather an appellation. The King of Assyria, or the great king, was looked up to by the smaller Asiatic states for protection, and consequently styled their <span class="accented">Jareb</span>, avenger or defender, just as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;</span>. savior, was a title applied to or assumed by certain kings for a similar reason, as Ptolemy Soter and others. The object of Israel's idolatry is carried off as a present to propitiate or appease the wrath of the Assyrian patron and protector - probably Shalmaneser in the present instance - or taken as a trophy to grace the triumph of the conqueror. So far from defending the calf-people, as Israel had become, their calf-god could not defend itself; instead of preserving its worshippers from deportation, it was doomed itself to deportation. Ephraim, the premier tribe. received shame, and Israel, the remaining tribes that had followed its lead and adopted its evil counsel, shared the shame; all of them together were thoroughly put to shame because of their mistaken and wicked policy. The counsel of Jeroboam - for to it, in our opinion, is the reference - appeared an able stroke of policy; but this policy, by which he hoped to detach Israel from Judah, was not only frustrated, but proved positively ruinous, so far were the means from effecting the end, or the end from justifying the wisdom of the means. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity is but a collection of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water. Sinners will in vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they now despise as a Saviour.</body></html>
