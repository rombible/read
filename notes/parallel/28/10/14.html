The prophet seems to hear the advance of the invading army, and see the fall of Samaria's fortress.<p><span class= "bld">Shalman.</span>--The references in the margin are not to the same historic event. The allusion is very obscure. Schrader (<span class= "ital">Keilinschriften,</span> 2nd ed., pp. 440-2) suggests two theories: one that it refers to an episode in the campaign of Shalmaneser III. to the "cedar country" (Lebanon), in 775 B.C., or to Damascus in 773. He might then have penetrated into the Transjordanic country, and destroyed Arbela, near Pella (Beth-arbel). The other theory, that we have here a mention of the Moabitish king <span class= "ital">Salmanu,</span> whose name occurs in Tiglath-pileser's inscription, is far-fetched and improbable. On the other hand, Geiger, following the hint of Jerome, identifies Shalman with Zalmunna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm" title="Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you slew at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.">Judges 8:18</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-11.htm" title="Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yes, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:">Psalm 83:11</a>). The kind of barbarity here referred to is illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.">2Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/137-8.htm" title="O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewards you as you have served us.">Psalm 137:8-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled.</span> This was the fruit of their doings, the result of their sins. The tumult of war is already heard, and the work of destruction has begun. The word <span class="accented">shaon</span>, tumult, is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as applied to the loud rushing of waters, then the tumult of advancing warriors. The preposition <span class="accented">be</span> is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as above by the Authorized Version, Umbreit, and others; and, joined with "peoples" (which is plural), signifies that the confused noise of war would be heard among their own peoples, or the multitude of the mighty ones in whom they had had such confidence; or the plural may refer to the tribes of Israel, each of which was an <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>, though Keil would confine this meaning to Pentateuchal times. Host of the versions read the singular, like our own Authorized Version, yet it must still be referred to the people of Israel. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the preposition is translated "against" by many modern interpreters, and thus the confused noise of the advance of the enemy against Israel is denoted. The attack of the invaders is directed against the <span class="accented">fortresses</span>, or fenced cities, so called from a verb denoting "to cut off" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e6;&#x5d3;</span>), as if all approach to them were cut off, and assault impossible. Nevertheless they were to go down, all of them, before the enemy - laid waste and spoiled; while inhuman cruelty would characterize the conquerors. As an illustration of or specimen resembling that cruelty, an obscure piece of history is quoted. <span class="cmt_word">As Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children</span>. In the great variety of opinion with respect to the event referred to, and the consequent diversity of exposition, we shall not venture to do more than select that which on the whole, notwithstanding a certain chronological difficulty that lies against it, appears the most probable. Accordingly, Beth-arbel may have been Arbela, mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:2 and more than once by Josephus, in Upper Galilee, in the tribe of Naphtali, between Sephoris and Tiberias, now <span class="accented">Irbid</span>; and <span class="accented">Shalman</span> may be an abbreviation for Shal-maneser; while the circumstance here mentioned may have been an incident of the campaign of which we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3, 5</a>. "Against him came up Shalmaneser King of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant.... Then the King of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years." The manifestation of the cruelty was when the mother, with true motherly affection, bent over her children to defend them, and she and they perished in a common ruin, or when the children were dashed to the ground before their mother's eyes, and she, done to death, hurled upon them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-15 Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners, therefore in mercy he desires their chastisement. The children of iniquity still remained in Israel. The enemies would be gathered against them. It is just with God to make those know what hardships mean, who indulge themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleanse their hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken and contrite spirit. Let them abound in works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity towards one another: herein let them sow to the Spirit. Seeking the Lord is to be every day's work, but there are special occasions when to seek him. Christ shall come as the Lord our righteousness, and grant us of it abundantly. If we sow in righteousness, we shall reap according to mercy; a reward not of debt, but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction. As our comforts, so our confidences in the service of sin will certainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy hope in him shall not deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes. Whatever mischief is done, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's sins bring on them, even in this world!</body></html>
