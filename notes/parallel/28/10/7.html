Such was the instability of the throne of Israel at this period. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-11.htm" title="I gave you a king in my anger, and took him away in my wrath.">Hosea 13:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for Samaria, her king is out off as the foam upon the water</span> (face <span class="accented">of the</span> waters). Instead of the throne of Samaria being established, or the kingdom consolidated by the idolatrous measures which Jeroboam had adopted for the purpose, the king himself was cut off as foam upon the surface of the waters, or as a chip carried off by the current, and the kingdom ingloriously ruined. Though the sense is sufficiently plain, the sentence has been variously constructed. Thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> one of the Hebrew commentators renders it, "In the city of Samaria her king has been made like foam on the surface of the water" (be being understood and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> taken in the sense of "being like"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Rashi, understanding the verb to signify being "reduced to silence," explains, "The King of Samaria is brought to silence." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The correct signification of the verb, however, is "cut off" or "annihilated," while the construction may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> an asyndeton; thus: "Samaria (and) her king;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Samaria taken as nominative absolute, - thus in the Authorized Version, "(As for) Samaria, her king is cut off;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> supplying <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> to the second noun, with Aben Ezra, "Samaria is cut off, her king is cut off." Some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> consider it simpler to translate as follows: "Samaria is cut off; her king is like [literally, 'as'] a chip on the surface of the waters." In this way the Massoretic punctuation is neglected. <span class="accented">Sheraton is</span> feminine, as the names of cities and countries usually are, and therefore the suffix to "king" is feminine, while the masculine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, is justified by its position at the head of the sentence; for, according to Gesenius, the predicate at the beginning of a clause or sentence "often takes its simplest and readiest form, viz. the masculine singular, even when the subject," not yet expressed, but coming after, "is feminine or plural." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span> is explained either as "foam" or "splinter." The latter is, perhaps, preferable, as the verbal root cognate with the Arabic <span class="accented">katsapha</span> signifies "to break," "break off," "crack;" then "to be angry" (its most common meaning) from the sudden breaking out or breaking loose of passion, with which may be compared the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>, from the same root, is literally a" breaking or breaking off," "barking," The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span>, again, has two principal meanings - one "to be like," the other "to be silent" (connected, according to Gesenius, with a different root, <span class="accented">darnam, dum, like</span> the English "dumb"); or the meanings are traceable to one root, in the sense of "making flat," "plane," "smooth;" then "silent," and so "reduced to silence," "destroyed." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity is but a collection of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water. Sinners will in vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they now despise as a Saviour.</body></html>
