Gibeah.--</span>Thou didst commence thy obscene transgressions long before the disruption of the kingdom of Rehoboam, even at Gibeah. Gibeah is emblematic of gross and cruel sensuality, in allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-20.htm" title="And the old man said, Peace be with you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only lodge not in the street.">Judges 19:20</a>, just as Sodom is used for unnatural vice.<p><span class= "bld">There they stood.</span>--Or rather, <span class= "ital">remained</span> sinning after the same manner. The rest of the verse should be rendered, <span class= "ital">Shall there not overtake them in Gibeah</span> (used mystically) <span class= "ital">the war made against the wicked?</span> (Comp. Judges 20) But Dr. Pusey and others take it categorically, implying that though the exterminating war against the men of Gibeah did not overtake them, and has not yet, it shall now, and soon. But the former interpretation is to be preferred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah.</span> Two explanations given of this clause - namely, that which understands, <span class="accented">rain</span> comparatively, that is, "more than" - their sins were greater than those of the Benjamites in the days of Gibeah; and that which refers the sin here spoken of to the appointment of Saul, who was of Gibeah of Benjamin, to be king - must be unhesitatingly rejected. Tile sin of the men of Gibeah was the shameful outrage committed on the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah, which with its consequences is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. and 20. That sin became proverbial, overtopping, as it did, all ordinary iniquities by its shameless atrocity and heinousness. By along-continued course of sin, even from ancient days, Ephraim has been preparing for a fearful doom. <span class="cmt_word">There they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</span> This portion of the verse is not a little perplexing, and in consequence has called forth considerable diversity of exposition. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that which is implied in the Authorized Version, viz. "there they <span class="accented">stood</span>," smitten twice but not destroyed, chastened but not killed, the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them then so as utterly to destroy them, but it shall overtake them now. Or if the verb "overtake," which is future, be strictly rendered, the meaning is - Not a battle like that in Gibeah against the children of iniquity shall overtake them, but one much more sanguinary and terrible, resulting, not in the reduction of a single tribe to six hundred men, but in the extirpation of ten tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of Keil and others, though not the same, is similar. It is: "There, in Gibea, did they <span class="accented">remain</span>, persevering in the sin of Gibeah, and yet the war in Gibeah against the sinners has not overtaken them." This makes the meaning of the prophet to be that since the days of Gibeah the Israelites persevered in the same or like sin as the Gibeahites; and, though the Gibeahites were so severely punished, actually destroyed, because of their sin, the ten tribes of Israel, persisting in the same or similar sin, have not yet been resisted with any such exterminating war. Jehovah announces his intention now to visit them with punishment and severest chastisement for all. The meaning which Keil aims at may be better brought out by rendering the latter clause interrogatively; thus: "There they stood - persisting in the criminality of Gibeah - shall there not overtake them, living as they do in Gibeah, the war which exterminated the children of crime?" It is admitted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> may have been the meaning of "persevering;" but a better sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is gained by Wunsche referring the subject of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> to the Benjamites; the suffix of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span> to the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, or "children of iniquity," that is, their guilty tribesmen in Gibeah; taking the intermediate clause parenthetically; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> to "stand in defense of;" thus: "Since the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel: there they (the Benjamites) stood in defense of the children of iniquity, that the war might not reach them in Gibeah." This gives a satisfactory sense, and intimates that, by a long-continued course of iniquity and crime, the Ephraimites were preparing themselves for a fearful fate. Already from days long gone by grievous guilt cleaved to them; thus in the days of Gibeah they (the Benjamites) stood by their iniquitous brethren that the battle in Gibeah might not reach them. As this was before the disruption, the Benjamites were part and parcel of Israel here represented by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller's explanation is the following: "They (the Benjamites) <span class="accented">survived</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>) being severely punished, though they did not entirely perish, six hundred being left to revive the tribe." But a still severer punishment awaits the Israelites (the person being changed from the second to the third, and the prophet addressing himself to hearer or reader): not the war waged in Gibeah (or on account of the crime committed there) against the children of iniquity shall overtake them, but a far more deadly and destructive war. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> is by metathesis for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, commotion; <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-15 Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners, therefore in mercy he desires their chastisement. The children of iniquity still remained in Israel. The enemies would be gathered against them. It is just with God to make those know what hardships mean, who indulge themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleanse their hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken and contrite spirit. Let them abound in works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity towards one another: herein let them sow to the Spirit. Seeking the Lord is to be every day's work, but there are special occasions when to seek him. Christ shall come as the Lord our righteousness, and grant us of it abundantly. If we sow in righteousness, we shall reap according to mercy; a reward not of debt, but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction. As our comforts, so our confidences in the service of sin will certainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy hope in him shall not deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes. Whatever mischief is done, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's sins bring on them, even in this world!</body></html>
