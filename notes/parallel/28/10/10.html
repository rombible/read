<span class="accented">and the peoples shall be gathered against them</span>. This expresses God's determination to punish sin and vindicate his justice as the infinitely Holy One. It means, not only that his desire to punish them does exist, but that, this desire being taken for granted, there shall be no let nor hindrance; nothing can stay his hand. Then the mode and means of chastisement are indicated - peoples, foreign invaders, shall be gathered against them. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> is future Qal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5e8;</span> irregularly, as if coming from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e1;&#x5d3;</span>, the daghesh in <span class="accented">samech</span> compensating for the absorbed <span class="accented">yod</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>When they shall bind themselves in their two furrows</span>; margin, <span class="accented">When I shall bind them for their two transgressions</span>, or, <span class="accented">in their two habitations</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Gesenius, Ewald, and others, abiding by the Kethir or textual reading of the original, translate, "Jehovah will chastise them before with their eyes," that is, not in secret, but openly before the world. They thus refer the word to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, eye, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> is "fountains," not "eyes." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Hebrew commentators, Aben Ezra and Kimchi, explain the word in the sense of "two furrows" as in Authorized Version; and refer them to Judah and Ephraim. Thus Kimchi says, "The prophet compares Judah and Ephraim to two plowing oxen. I thought they would plough well, but they have ploughed ill, since they have bound themselves together one with the other and have allied themselves the one with the other to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah." Similarly Rosenm&uuml;ller: "To be bound to two furrows is said of oxen plowing when they are bound together in a common yoke, so that in two adjacent furrows they walk together and with equal pace." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint rendering, based on the Qeri and followed by the Syriac and Arabic, gives a better and clearer sense than the preceding. It is, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and is followed by Jerome in <span class="accented">Super duas iniquitates suas</span>, as also by the most judicious expositors of ancient and modern times. Yet there is great variety as to what those iniquities are. Some, like Jerome, refer to the double idolatry - that of Micah and that of Jeroboam; others, like Dathe, to the two golden calves set up at Dan and Bethel; Cyril and Theodoret to the apostasy of Israel from Jehovah, and devotion to idols; De Wette and Keil to the double unfaithfulness of Israel to Jehovah and the royal house of David. The exact rendering would, according to any of these views, be, "When I bind them to their two transgressions," or, "When I allow the foreigners to bind them on account of their two transgressions;" that is to connect or yoke them to their two transgressions by the punishment, so that they, like beasts of burden, must drag them after them, whatever be the view we take of the nature of those transgressions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-15 Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners, therefore in mercy he desires their chastisement. The children of iniquity still remained in Israel. The enemies would be gathered against them. It is just with God to make those know what hardships mean, who indulge themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleanse their hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken and contrite spirit. Let them abound in works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity towards one another: herein let them sow to the Spirit. Seeking the Lord is to be every day's work, but there are special occasions when to seek him. Christ shall come as the Lord our righteousness, and grant us of it abundantly. If we sow in righteousness, we shall reap according to mercy; a reward not of debt, but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction. As our comforts, so our confidences in the service of sin will certainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy hope in him shall not deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes. Whatever mischief is done, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's sins bring on them, even in this world!</body></html>
