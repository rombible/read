or the act of treading and threshing may point to the rough treatment which Ephraim has in her pride dealt out to her neighbours and enemies. But the former interpretation is more probable. The verse should continue to read thus:--<span class= "ital">And I passed by the fairness of her neck</span> (to arrest her self-indulgence). <span class= "ital">I will harness Ephraim for riding</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> I will cause a rider, Assyria, to take possession of her, and she shall be bound in unwelcome toil to do the bidding of another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn.</span> Ephraim is compared to a heifer trained. The work she was taught to do was treading cut the corn; by training and habit it had became a second nature, so that she took delight in it. The connecting vowel occurs seldom, and usually with an antique coloring in prose, according to Ewald; it is poetical besides, and used in the concourse of words somewhat closely connected, but not in the strict construct state. Thus is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> accounted for. This work was probably easier, at all events pleasanter, than plowing or harrowing. In treading out corn oxen were not yoked together, but worked singly, treading it with their feet, or drawing a threshing-sledge, or iron-armed cylinder, over it; they were unmuzzled also, so that they were free to snatch an occasional mouthful of the grain, and frequently fattened by such indulgence. Such had been the position of Ephraim in easy employment, comfortable circumstances like the heifer threshing and allowed to eat at pleasure, pleasantly situated prosperous, self-indulgent, and luxurious. The victories of Ephraim - threshing and treading down may perhaps be also hinted at. <span class="cmt_word">But I passed over upon her fair neck</span> (margin, <span class="accented">the beauty of her neck</span>): <span class="cmt_word">I will make Ephraim to ride; Judak shall plough, and Jacob shall break his clods.</span> Times have changed, as is here indicated a yoke, that of Assyria, is placed on the fair neck, a rider is set on the sleek back. Mere onerous and less pleasant labor is now imposed. Judah too is to share the toil, being put to the heavier work of plowing while Jacob - the ten tribes, or the twelve including both Judah and Israel - shall cross plough; and thus both alike shall be henceforth employed in the heaviest labors of the field and the severest toils of agriculture. Once victorious, Ephraim is now to be subdued; once free and intractable, it must now receive the yoke and engage in laborious service. The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, is generally used in a bad sense; "to <span class="accented">pass over</span>," says Jerome, "especially when it is said of God, always signifies inflictions and troubles." The fatness of the neck is the ox's ornament or beauty. That is now to be assaulted or invaded gently it may be, and softly, as men are wont to approach a young untamed animal in order to put the yoke upon it. This passing over, however tender, fixes the yoke on Ephraim's neck all the same. A more difficult word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, which Ewald <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> renders, "I will set a rider" on Ephraim, of course to subdue and tame; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome has, "I will mount or ride," thus representing Jehovah himself as the mediate rider on Ephraim. The first sense has a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>, "Thou hast made men to ride over our head," and thus ruling them at pleasure. Unwilling to bear the easy yoke of their Divine Ruler, they shall be subjected to the tyrant mastery of man. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil says the word here is "not" to mount or ride, 'but' to drive or use for drawing and driving,' <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> harness," as to the plough and harrow. This meaning is best reached by understanding the words thus: "I will make the yoke to ride on Ephraim's neck;" as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5db;&#x5d1;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-16.htm">2 Kings 13:16</a>, for "put thine hand upon the bow," margin, "make thine hand to ride upon the bow." The remaining clauses of the verse is a further development of this expression, but extending to Judah; and thus including both Judah and Ephraim, or Jacob - both kingdoms. The Septuagint version of the last clause is peculiar; it is <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;</span>. That is, as explained by Jerome, "I shall leave Judah for the present and say nothing about him; but whoever, whether of Ephraim or Judah, shall observe my precepts, he shall acquire strength for himself and be called Jacob." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-15 Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners, therefore in mercy he desires their chastisement. The children of iniquity still remained in Israel. The enemies would be gathered against them. It is just with God to make those know what hardships mean, who indulge themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleanse their hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken and contrite spirit. Let them abound in works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity towards one another: herein let them sow to the Spirit. Seeking the Lord is to be every day's work, but there are special occasions when to seek him. Christ shall come as the Lord our righteousness, and grant us of it abundantly. If we sow in righteousness, we shall reap according to mercy; a reward not of debt, but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction. As our comforts, so our confidences in the service of sin will certainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy hope in him shall not deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes. Whatever mischief is done, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's sins bring on them, even in this world!</body></html>
