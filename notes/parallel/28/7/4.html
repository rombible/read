it may not, therefore, be amiss to supplement the foregoing observations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Aben Ezra accounts for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> being accented as <span class="accented">milel</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on the ground that, though a feminine formation, it is really masculine (to agree with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>), like <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, both of which, though feminine in form, are notwithstanding of the masculine gender. Abarbanel, who is followed by Wunsche, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;</span> as a participle feminine for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>, which is justified by the circumstance that the names of fire and of what is connected therewith are feminine in the Semitic, so that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> is feminine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, which Ewald and others take, properly we think, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as participle of Hiph., is treated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by Genenius and Maurer as infirmitive Qal with <span class="accented">rain</span> prefixed, which would occasion the awkward and unusual combination of two infinitives each prefixed with <span class="accented">rain</span> in immediate sequence; while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kimchi takes it as infinitive Hiph. contracted for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> More important still is the interpretation of the verse. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that already given, and which is in some measure supported by the following rabbinic comments: "Their evil passion," says Rashi, "which stirs them up, rests from kneading the dough until it is leavened, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from the time that any one has thought on evil in his heart how he shall execute it, he rests and sleeps till the morning, when he shall be able to execute it, as the baker rests from kneading the dough until it is leavened, when he can bake it." Similar and yet somewhat peculiar is the concluding portion of Kimchi's comment: "As soon as he lays the pieces of wood into the oven, in order to heat it, he commands the women to knead, and he ceases to stir them (the women) up until the dough is leavened, as he estimates it in his heart, and then he rouses them to come with the dough to bake it. And this is the time when the oven is heated." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> as a noun prefixed with the preposition <span class="accented">rain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and translates the whole as follows: "They are all adulterers, as an oven glowing from flame for hot-baking, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened." The interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of Wunsche differs considerably from both the preceding; it is, "They are all adulterers, like an even, burning from a baker, who <span class="accented">rests while stoking</span> from the kneading of the dough till its fermentation;" and he cites in favor of this view Aben Ezra as follows: "This verse is inverted, and accordingly the sense is: As the oven of a baker burneth from the kneading of the dough till its fermentation, so that the baker can scarcely cease to stir it up, but must stir it up and heat it violently." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 A practical disbelief of God's government was at the bottom of all israel's wickedness; as if God could not see it or did not heed it. Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamed by evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles as a nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actual wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the Divine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, but hardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when in trouble and distress.</body></html>
