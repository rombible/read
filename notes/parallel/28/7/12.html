He begins by the application of the comparison of Ephraim to a dove. Exactly as a dove in its silliness falls into the net set by the fowler, so Israel runs into the net of destruction in seeking help from Egypt and Assyria. The literal rendering is, according <span class="accented">as they go</span>, or, <span class="accented">whatsoever way they shall go</span>. God threatens to spread a net over them, from which there can be no escape. The chief aim of Hebrew sovereigns and rulers was to defend themselves from Egypt by the help of Assyria, or from Assyria by the aid of Egypt; in either case God threatens to spread over them the net of destruction as the bird-catcher. The application to one or other of these powers God forbade, but when they go to either for relief, the result is sure to prove fatal. The image of a net is frequent in Ezekiel; so in Job, he "hath compassed me with his net." <span class="cmt_word">I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven</span>. The comparison with birds and bird-catching continues. Though their sunward soaring flight be high as the eagle's, or rapid as the soft swift wing of the dove, they cannot outspeed or escape the hand of God, but shall be brought down to earth. Or the idea may be that, swiftly as a bird of prey swoops down out of the free air of heaven upon its quarry on the low-lying earth, Jehovah will bring Israel down out of the air of freedom into the net of captivity. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a> we read, "Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord;" likewise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a>, "Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down." <span class="cmt_word">I will chastise them as their congregation hath heard.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> is an anomalous Hiph. instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, that is, <span class="accented">yod</span> mobile instead of <span class="accented">yod</span> quiescent or diphthongal <span class="accented">zere</span>. The literal rendering makes the meaning more obvious; it is: "I will chastise them according to the tidings [or,' announcement '] to their congregation." In the Law and by the prophets it was repeatedly declared that judgments would fall upon the disobedient and rebellions. As specimens of such announcements, we may refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15-35</a> The prophet now assures Ephraim that the judgments so frequently and forcibly announced to the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness, and repeated in subsequent times by the prophets, would be executed on the rebellious rigorously, and in exact accordance with those many previous denunciations. Kimchi has the following comment: "I will assemble them through the chastisement of the peoples, as I announced to their assembly in the wilderness words of chastisement, which are written in the Law, if they will not hearken to the words of the Law."

There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
