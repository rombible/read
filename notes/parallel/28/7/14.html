This is based on a slightly different reading, contained in some of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., which is not improbably the right one. The charge is that all their simulated penitence is to secure physical comforts, not to show conformity with the Divine will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds.</span> This clause may be more correctly rendered, <span class="accented">They did not cry to me in their heart</span>, <span class="accented">but howl upon their beds</span>. Their falsehood manifested itself in works as well as words; a practical example is here given. They did not, in reality, seek help from God; if they sought at all, it was insincerely. They cried to God, but that cry did not proceed from their heart. They gave vent to their feelings of distress by howlings upon their beds; but those howlings were the expression of unbelief and despair, not by any means evidences of faith. "They do not cry to me," says Aben Ezra, "as the sick man cries to the physician." The comment of Kimchi is still fuller and more explicit: "They have not cried to me in their heart, because of their notion that I do not see their cry nor know what is good or bad for them; but they howl upon their beds, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when they are upon their bed and when they think of that misfortune which is coming upon them. They howl and weep because of their evil case, and do not think that the evil falls on them from me, because they have broken faith with me." The form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> is correctly explained by Gesenius as future Hiph. with preformative put before the third person, the <span class="accented">yod</span> of the simple form being superficially taken to belong to the stem. His derivation from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, God, as if a cry to him for help, is incorrect; it is really an onomatopoetic word. <span class="cmt_word">They assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</span> What this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> assembling of themselves was does not clearly appear; whether it was in the market-place or elsewhere to purchase corn in time of famine, as some think; or in idol-temples to propitiate their deities, like the Roman <span class="accented">supplicatio</span> or <span class="accented">lectiosternium</span>, <span class="accented">as others</span> suppose; or for the performance of some extra rite of worship to Jehovah; or for the purpose of plunder in a season of scarcity; or generally their assembling in knots and crowds to discuss anxiously and lament despairingly the distressed state of the country; - their chief design and highest aim being a good supply of corn and wine, that is, the supply of mere bodily wants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span>, as their rendering is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, equivalent to "they cut themselves," or" pined for corn and wine;" corresponding to which rendering is Cyril's exposition: "As enthusiasts and fanatics making incisions with steel in their breasts and both hands, and absurdly all but shedding in sacrifice their own blood, perhaps to graven images." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome, taking the verb from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to ruminate, translates accordingly: "super triticum et vinum ruminabant." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The Syriac, tracing it to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to be afraid, translates: "They feared (or, were fearfully anxious) about corn and wine." The common reading and rendering are clearly preferable; Kimchi's exposition is in harmony therewith: "When corn or new wine comes into the city for sale, they all assemble at (or, round) it on account of the famine which is in the city; and yet they fall away from me." The construction of the last clause is pregnant, that is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "they turn aside (and turn) against me." Here, again <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the LXX. seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, to which their translation, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, equivalent to "they were instructed by me," corresponds. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:8-16 Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough, none of it fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship of Jehovah. There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
