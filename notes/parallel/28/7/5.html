(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm" title="For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.">Acts 2:15</a>.) There is bitterness in the use of the pronoun "our" before "king." Otherwise we must render, <span class= "ital">have made themselves ill with the fever of wine</span> (the Authorised version is here inaccurate). The last clause is obscure; probably it means "he (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> our king) hath made common cause with scorners," and is boon-companion of the dissolute and depraved.

Consequently, <span class="accented">yom is</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the object of this verb; while, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> according to the usual rendering, it is the accusative of time, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>; others again <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> take the word as a nominative absolute, or translate the clause as an independent one; thus Simson: "It is the day of our king." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Again, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> st. construct of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5dd;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span>, (for the construct state is used, not only for the genitive-relation, but also before prepositions, the relative pronoun, relative clauses, even ray copulative, etc.), is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the accusative of the clause, equivalent to "in the heat (proceeding) from wine;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">be</span> may be understood; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the preposition rain may be regarded as transposed, - Rashi explains it: "From the heat of the wine that burneth in them;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> may be supplied, as Wunsche suggests, equivalent to "possessors (bearers) of heat from wine." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> is a scoffer and worse than <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, a fool, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, a simpleton; the last acts through inexperience, the second from unwisdom, the first, though possessing in some measure both wisdom and experience, acts in disregard of both. The meaning is given by Kimchi in the following comment: "The sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span> is that the one came with his bottle full of wine, and the other with his bottle; and they made the king sick;" and to this there is an exact parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>, "Woe unto him that giveth his neigh-hour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also." In the second clause the expression, "drawing out the hand," is borrowed from drunken carousals, in which the hand is stretched out in asking, receiving, and handing the goblets; or, more simply, according to Pussy, who says, "Men in drink reach out their hands to any whom they meet, in token of their sottish would be friendliness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 A practical disbelief of God's government was at the bottom of all israel's wickedness; as if God could not see it or did not heed it. Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamed by evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles as a nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actual wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the Divine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, but hardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when in trouble and distress.</body></html>
