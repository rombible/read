Of these exclamations, the first is general and indefinite, the second is specific and precise. The thought of coming chastisement calls forth the exclamation of woe; while the second exclamation fixes the character and explains the nature of that woe denounced. In neither case does <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> need to be supplied; the opposite expression is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> In assigning the reason, there is a retrospective reference to the figures of the two immediately preceding verses. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> with rain is employed in relation to birds which, when scared from their nest, fly away. Kimchi thinks it applies to the abstention or withdrawal of the Israelites from Divine service in the national sanctuary in Jerusalem. His comment is: "They fly from me, from the service of the house of my sanctuary, to the service of the calves; and this is a breach of faith and defection from me." The LXX. translate the beginning of the second clause freely by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "they are cowards;" and Jerome by "miseri (maticulose) erunt, et semper timentis ac formidantes." The cause assigned is their breaking covenant with God, which is expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, literally, "to break away from," "tear one's self loose from." <span class="cmt_word">Though I have redeemed them</span>. This first part of the last clause is rendered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a past by some, as Jerome, who refers it to the redemption from Egypt; thus also the Chaldee: "And I was their Deliverer." Rosenm&uuml;ller approves of this, but, instead of restricting it to the deliverance from Egypt, includes their recent deliverance from the Syrians by Jeroboam II. It is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> better rendered in a voluntative or optative sense: "I would (should like) to redeem them, but they speak lies against (or, concerning) me." The verb '<span class="accented">ephdem</span> cannot with any propriety be taken for a preterit. Yet they have spoken lies against me; rather, <span class="accented">but they on their part have spoken lies con</span>cerning me. The prophet had already charged them with lying at ver. 3, and previously at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; but their lies were not confined to their intercourse or dealings with their fellow-men; they spoke lies <span class="accented">against</span> or, as the preposition sometimes signifies, <span class="accented">concerning</span> God. The lies in question included, no doubt, a denial of his essential Deity or sole Divinity; of his power or willingness either to protect or punish. Or they might consist in their falsehood in drawing near to God with their lips without either true faith or real affection in their hearts; some were directly opposed to the claims of Jehovah, some insincere in his service, and others turned aside to the idolatry of the calves - all, with probably some honorable exceptions, had proved false to his covenant with Israel. The last clause has been taken <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> independently by Ewald, without any considerable alteration of the sense: "I, for my part, would redeem them, but they, on their side, speak lies against me." Other acceptations, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> interrogative and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> conditional, evidently mistake the sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The whole clause is correctly explained by Kimchi thus: "<span class="accented">It</span> was in my heart to redeem them out of their distress; but they speak lies against me, while they say that I know nothing nor exercise any providential care over their actions, whether their actions are good or bad. Therefore I have withdrawn my providential oversight, and have hidden my face from them, and they shall be consumed." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:8-16 Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough, none of it fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship of Jehovah. There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
