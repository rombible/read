Like an oven in their heart with their wiles. Their baker sleepeth all the night,</span> &c. The metaphor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm" title="They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceases from raising after he has kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.">Hosea 7:4</a> is resumed. The baker, having left his dough to become leavened and his fire to smoulder, can afford to sleep. The baker may mean the evil passion which has been raging. Indeed, Wnsche and Schmoller, by a slight change of punctuation, obtain the rendering "their anger," instead of "their baker," which is supported by the Targum and Syriac version. After the murderous plots and carousal, the conspiracy ripens with the day; then will come the outburst of violence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - This verse, Wunsche thinks, is probably the most difficult in the whole book. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The translation of the first clause in the Authorized Version is susceptible of a more literal and improved rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "For they bring near as an oven their heart, whilst they lie in wait;" that is, they approach the king with loyalty on their lips, but hatred in their heart. Their heart (which is the fact) is heated with evil passion, as an oven (which is the figure) is heated for baking purposes; while they are secretly set for wickedness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Wunsche, after enumerating a great variety of renderings and expositions, with none of which he is satisfied, gives the following: "For they press close together; like an oven is their heart in their artifice (cunning)." The meaning, according to the same author, is that all, scoffers and king alike, press near each other, being of one heart and disposition; cunning makes them one single society. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil translates more simply as follows: "For they have brought their heart into their ambush, as into the oven." In this rendering he combines the explanation of Ewald and Hitzig. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> In the second clause which Keil translates in the same sense as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Authorized Version, Wunsche <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> changes the common reading into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, their anger, and translates accordingly, "All night their anger sleeps, in the morning it burns like flaming fire." That the reading here is somewhat doubtful may be inferred from the fact that the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;</span>: while the Chaldee and Syrian <span class="accented">rugzehon</span>, their fury; still, as it is only a conjectural emendation, we prefer abiding by the ordinary reading and rendering, at least in this instance. The following explanation of the whole verse by Aben Ezra gives a consistent sense: "By <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5dd;</span> are meant their evil purposes, which they devise all night long. And their heart is like an oven, only with the difference that there the baker sleeps the whole night, and only in the morning kindles the oven; but their heart does not sleep at all, but devises evil the whole night." It is curious how Rashi and Kimchi, while giving in the main the same explanation with Aben Ezra, differ from him about the meaning of the sleeping. The former has the following brief comment: "Their baker lights the oven. After they have prepared their heart and thought out the consummation of their wickedness, how they could carry the same into effect, then their baker sleeps, that is, they sleep till morning; at the break of day, however, they burn <span class="accented">like</span> fire, until they have brought their wickedness fully to an end." Kimchi goes into the matter a little more fully, as is usual with him; he comments as follows: "The heart is the instrument of the thought, and the power that works therein is the baker by way of figure. And as the baker lights the oven at night, and in the morning finds that the pieces of wood have burnt out, and he baketh therein the bread, which is the chief end of the work of heating; and lo, the baker sleeps in the night after he has put the pieces of wood into the oven, because he has nothing more to do till the morning. Just so the baker in this figurative sense, which is the power of thought - he sleeps in the night; as if he said he lies there and rests, because the project comes not forth into execution until the morning; and the prophet calls him who thinks sleeping, because that there is no effort of the body in thought, In the morning he burneth, as if he said that they are in flame in the morning to execute the evil which they have devised at night." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 A practical disbelief of God's government was at the bottom of all israel's wickedness; as if God could not see it or did not heed it. Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamed by evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles as a nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actual wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the Divine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, but hardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when in trouble and distress.</body></html>
