Their God-defying attitude, as described in ver. 15, is represented in ver. 16 allegorically as a deceitful bow, which fails to scud the arrow to the mark; also their unsuccess is represented as exposing them to the derision of Egypt; while the princes who spake so exceeding proudly, and who instigated their ungodliness and consequent wretchedness, would be slain with the sword. This is the drift of the whole verse; its details, however, demand more particular consideration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is by some identified in meaning with <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to "the Most High;" by others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is taken adverbially, and translated "upwards." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint does not express it. translating <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, "They turned aside to that which is not [literally, 'nothing']." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Jerome translates it as is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, were equivalent to "yoke: They returned that they might be without a yoke." Their return, according to Jerome, would be to their pristine condition before the can of Abram, like the other nations, without yoke or knowledge of law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The return spoken of implies that there were junctures at which they seemed disposed to return to religiousness, but ere long they again relapsed into idolatry. They disappointed the high hopes raised, and missed their own high destiny, and thus they resembled a bow, of which the string, losing its elasticity, could not propel the arrow to the object aimed at. Appearing to return to the worship of Jehovah, they turned aside to an idol. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a>, they "turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:8-16 Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough, none of it fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship of Jehovah. There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.</body></html>
