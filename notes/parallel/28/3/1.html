Gomer is now the concubine slave of another--possibly in poor and destitute condition. And yet the prophet's love for her is like Jehovah's love for "the children of Israel, even when they are turned to other gods, <span class= "ital">and love grape-cakes"</span>--the luscious sacrificial cakes used in idolatrous worship: a term generally descriptive of the licentious accompaniments of the Ashtoreth worship. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The general meaning of this verse is well given in the Chaldee Targum: "Go, utter a prophecy against the house of Israel, who are like a woman very dear to her husband, and who, though she is unfaithful to him, is nevertheless so greatly loved by him that he is unwilling to put her away. Such is the love of the Lord towards Israel; but they turn aside to the idols of the nations." The word <span class="accented">mr</span> is in contrast with '<span class="accented">techillath</span>, as the second part of Jehovah's continued discourse. It is erroneously and, contrary to the accents, constructed with "said" by Kimchi and others (Ewald considers it admissible, Umbreit preferable). Kimchi's comment on this verse is: "After the prophet finished his words of consolation, he returns to words of censure, turning to the men of his own time. And it is the custom of the prophets to intermingle reproofs with consolations in their discourses. But he says <span class="accented">yet</span> (again), because he had already commanded him to marry a wife of whoredoms, and now he speaks to him another parable." This time he does not employ the ordinary and usual word "take," but "love." plainly implying that he had already married her, so that her unfaithfulness took place in wedlock; or rather indicating the object of the union. <span class="cmt_word">Beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress</span>. Her friend or companion is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> her lawful husband, but contemporaneously and continuously with her husband's love to her are her adulteries with others, as is implied by the participles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;</span>, being indefinite as not having article or suffix, is understood by some to be an acquaintance or lover, and preferred, as a milder term, to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>. The contrast was realized in Jehovah's love for Israel, notwithstanding their spiritual adultery in worshipping other gods. <span class="cmt_word">According to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel who look</span> (turn) <span class="cmt_word">to other gods</span>. Two expressions in this clause recall, if they do not actually reflect, the words of two older Scriptures; thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a> we read, "Because the Lord loved you;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-18.htm">Deuteronomy 31:18</a>, "They are turned unto ether gods." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And love flagons of wine</span> (margin, <span class="accented">grapes</span>). The term <span class="accented">ashishe</span>, according to Rashi and Aben Ezra, means "bowls," that is, "bowls of wine" (literally, "of grapes"). They probably connected the word with the root <span class="accented">shesh</span>, six, a sextorius, and hence any other wine-vessel. The Septuagint, however, renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "cakes with dried grapes." This meaning is to be preferred, whether we derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, to press together, or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire; according to the former and correct derivation, the sense being cakes of grapes pressed together; according to the latter, cakes baked with fire. Gesenius differentiates the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, dried grapes, but not pressed together into a cake, and from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, figs pressed together into a cake. These raisin-cakes were regarded as luxuries and used as delicacies; hence a fondness for such indicated a proneness to sensual indulgence, and figuratively the sensuous service belonging to idol-worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-3 The dislike of men to true religion is because they love objects and forms, which allow them to indulge, instead of mortifying their lusts. How wonderful that a holy God should have good-will to those whose carnal mind is enmity against Him! Here is represented God's gracious dealings with the fallen race of mankind, that had gone from him. This is the covenant of grace he is willing to enter into with them, they must be to him a people, and he will be to them a God. They must accept the punishment of their sin, and must not return to folly. And it is a certain sign that our afflictions are means of good to us, when we are kept from being overcome by the temptations of an afflicted state.</body></html>
