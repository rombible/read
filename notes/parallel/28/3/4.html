Her bitter experience was a parable of Israel's utter deprivation of all civil and religious privilege. There was to be no king, or prince, or sacred ritual of any kind. Observe that the terms of both cultus are here intermingled, suggesting the idolatrous conceptions of the pure ancient practice which Jeroboam's calf-worship was only too likely to introduce. By "image" we are to understand upright stones, representing Baal or the sun-god. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm" title="Israel is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit to himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he has increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.">Hosea 10:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-4.htm" title="And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.">Exodus 24:4</a>.) On "ephod," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-14.htm" title="Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.">Judges 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/18-17.htm" title="And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.">Judges 18:17-20</a>; on "teraphim," <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.">1Samuel 19:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm" title="For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.">Zechariah 10:2</a>. In the last two passages the word is translated "idols," "images," their use as instruments of divination being condemned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and teraphim</span>. For a long series of years they were thus doomed to be without civil polity, or ecclesiastical privilege, or prophetic intimations. More particularly they were to remain without royal rule, or princely power, or priestly function, or prophetic instruction. As the prophet's wife was neither to be, strictly speaking, her husband's nor yet belong to another man; so Israel, as represented by her, was destined to be deprived of independent self-government and princely sovereignty; of Divine service, whether allowed as by sacrifice - the central part of Hebrew worship - or disallowed as by statue; of oracular responses, whether lawful as by the ephod or unlawful as by teraphim. There was thus an entire breaking up of Church and state as they had long existed; of all civil and ecclesiastical relations and privileges as they had been long enjoyed. Without a king of their own nationality to sit upon the throne, or a prince of their own race as heir apparent to the kingdom, or princes as the great officers of state; without offering by sacrifice to Jehovah, or statue by way of memorial to Baal; without means of ascertaining the will of Heaven in relation to the future by the Urim and Thummim of the high-priestly ephod, only the more than questionable means of soothsaying by the teraphim; - the children of Israel were to be left. And what attaches special importance to this remarkable passage is the undeniable tact that these predictions were uttered, not only before the dissolution of the monarchy and the cessation of sacrifices, but at a time when no human sagacity could foresee and no human power foretell the future abstention of the Hebrew race from idol-worship so long practiced, and from heathenish divination resorted to from such an early period of their history. Rashi, in his comment, has the following: "I said to her, Many days shalt thou abide for me; thou shalt not go a-whoring after other gods; for if thou shalt play the harlot, thy sons shall remain many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice in the sanctuary in Judah, and without a statue of Baal in Samaria of the kings of Israel, and without an ephod with Urim and Thummim which declared to them secrets, and without teraphim; they are images that are made with the observation of one hour composed for the purpose, and which speak of themselves and declare secrets; and so Jonathan has translated, "Neither will there be an ephod nor one to give a response.'" Similarly Aben Ezra: "Without king, nor is there any objection from the Chasmoneans, for they were not of the children of Judah... without sacrifice to Jehovah nor statue to Baal, without ephod to Jehovah and without teraphim to the worshippers of idols, which Laban called his gods." It is a matter of much consequence that some of the ablest of the Jewish expositors realize these predictions as applicable to their own case and the existing circumstances of their nation. Thus Kimchi, in commenting on this verse, says, "These are the days of the exile in which we are this day, and we have neither king nor prince of Israel, for we are in the power of the Gentiles, and in the power of their kings and princes... no sacrifice to God and no statue for worshippers of idols... and no ephod which shall declare future things by Urim and Thummim, and no teraphim for idolaters which declare the future according to the notion of those who believe in them; and thus we are this day in this exile, all the children of Israel;" he then cites the Targum of Jonathan in confirmation of his sentiments. For the ephod, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-14</a>, from which we learn that it was "a short cloak, covering shoulders and breast, wrought with colors and gold, formed of two halves connected by two shoulder-pieces, on each of which was an onyx engraved with six names of tribes, and held together round the waist by a girdle of the same material;" it was part of the high priest's attire. The teraphim - from the Arabic <span class="accented">tarifa</span>, to live comfortably, and <span class="accented">turfator</span>, a comfortable life, were the household gods and domestic oracles, like the Roman penates, and deriving the name from being thought the givers and guardians of a comfortable life, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>. They were images in human form and stature, either graven of wood or stone (<span class="accented">pesel</span>), or molten out of precious metal (<span class="accented">mas-sekhah</span>). The first mention of them is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>, and the name occurs fifteen times in the Old Testament. They appear to have been of Syrian or Chaldean origin. Aben Ezra says of them, "What appears to me most probable is that they had a human form and were made for the purpose of receiving supernal power, nor can I explain it further." The two principal species of offerings were the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d1;&#x5d7;</span>, or bloody sacrifice, and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>, or unbloody oblation. The former comprehended those entirely burnt on the altar, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, to ascend, from going up entirely in the altar-smoke; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d1;</span>, or those of which only the fat was burnt. According to the object of the offerer, they were <span class="accented">chattah</span>, sin offering, pointing to expiation or pardon for something done demanding punishment; or <span class="accented">asham</span>, trespass offering, implying satisfaction and acceptance, or something undone demanding amends; and <span class="accented">shelamim</span>, peace offerings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:4-5 Here is the application of the parable to Israel. They must long sit like a widow, stripped of all joys and honours; but shall at length be received again. Those that would seek the Lord so as to find him, must apply to Christ, and become his willing people. Not only are we to fear the Lord and his greatness, but the Lord and his goodness; not only his majesty, but his mercy. Even Jewish writers apply this passage to the promised Messiah; doubtless it foretold their future conversion to Christ, for which they are kept a separate people. Though the first fear of God arise from a view of his holy majesty and righteous vengeance, yet the experience of mercy and grace through Jesus Christ, will lead the heart to reverence so kind and glorious a Friend and Father, and to fear offending him.</body></html>
