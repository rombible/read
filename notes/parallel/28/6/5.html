Because of the fluctuating and formal nature of their religiousness, God cut them down (instead of rearing them up) through his prophets by fierce denunciations, and slew them (instead of reviving them) by the Divine word. The judgment of Jehovah went forth as the lightning-fish, or was as clear and conspicuous for justice as the light of day. Neither could outward services expiate their sins, when the proper feelings and meet fruits were absent. <span class="cmt_word">I have hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth.</span> The language is figurative - the first clause seems borrowed from hewing hard wood and shaping it so as to assume the required form; so God dealt with Israel to bring them into shape morally symmetrical, and make them correspond to the character of a holy people. The slaying is metaphorical, and consisted in the denunciation of death and destruction to the impenitent; in this way he killed, but did not make alive. A different rendering of the clause is given by the LXX. and also by Aben Ezra; the former has, "Therefore have I mown down your prophets; I have slain them with the word of my mouth;" the latter has, "The sense is that he slew some of the prophets who misled the people so that they did not turn (repent)." But <span class="accented">be</span> does not imply his hewing in among the prophets; it is instrumental. <span class="cmt_word">And thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</span> The judgments here spoken of are the Divine judgments denounced against, or inflicted on, the people. Another reading has the pronominal suffix of the first person: "My judgment goeth forth as the light;" to which the Septuagint corresponds: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "my judgment." <span class="accented">I desired mercy</span> (or, <span class="accented">mercy I delight in</span>)... <span class="accented">and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings</span>. The former is the right state of the life, the latter the correct condition of the heart; the former manifests itself in practice, the latter embraces the proper feelings and affections; the former is seen in works of charity and benevolence, the latter consists in right motives and the right relation of the soul to God. The Hebrew form of speech here used denotes inferior importance, not the negation of importance. A similar sentiment occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." Parallel statements are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7-9</a> and Psalm 50:8; also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. Our Lord cites the first clause of ver. 6 twice - once against Pharisaic ceremonialism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>), and again against rigorous sabbatarianism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>); while there is an allusion to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>, where love to God and to one's neighbor is declared to be better, or "more than, whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." Sacrifices in themselves, and when offered at the proper time and place, and as the expressions of penitent hearts and pure hands, were acceptable, and could not be otherwise, for God himself had appointed them. But soulless sacrifices offered by men steeped in sin were an abomination to the Lord; it was of such he said, "I cannot away with" them. It is to such that the prophet refers here, as is plain from the following verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4-11 Sometimes Israel and Judah seemed disposed to repent under their sufferings, but their goodness vanished like the empty morning cloud, and the early dew, and they were as vile as ever. Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments. May the Lord put his fear into our hearts, and set up his kingdom within us, and never leave us to ourselves, nor suffer us to be overcome by temptation.</body></html>
