Aben Ezra understands the exhortation of intellectual knowledge: "To know Jehovah is the secret of all wisdom, and for this alone was man created. But he cannot know God till he has learnt many doctrines of wisdom, which are, as it were, a ladder in order to mount up to this highest step of knowledge." Kimchi, on the other hand, though quoting Aben Ezra's comment with approval, inclines to the practical side of knowledge: "Let us follow on to know Jehovah, exercising justice and righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">His going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</span> Here, again, the translation of the Authorized Version is susceptible of improvement: <span class="accented">his going forth is fixed as the morning dawn</span>; <span class="accented">and he shall come to us as the plentiful rain, as the latter rain which watereth</span> (or, <span class="accented">watering</span>) <span class="accented">the earth</span>. Here we have two beautiful figures - the morning dawn and the fertilizing rain. The going forth of Jehovah is represented as the sun rising upon the earth, or rather as the dawn which heralds the day. The advent of salvation to his people is identified with, or symbolized by, his appearance. But the dawn of day only brings the commencement of salvation; its complement is found in the fruits and blessings of salvation. The root of <span class="accented">motsav</span> is <span class="accented">zatsa</span>, which is applied to the sunrise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>. Parallel passages are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, "Then shall thy light break forth as the morning (dawn), and thy health shall spring forth speedily;" and Isaiah 9:2, "The Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee." Further, the word <span class="accented">nakon</span>, meaning "prepared," "fixed firm," is applied to the clear bright light of morning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>, "The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect (<span class="accented">nekon</span>) day." The plentiful rain is that which falls after the sowing of the seed in October (the beginning of the Hebrew year) and in the following months; while the <span class="accented">malqosh</span> is the late or spring rain, which, tailing in March and till the middle of April, precedes and promotes the harvest. The LXX. translates the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> concluding clause by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> erroneously, for <span class="accented">zoreh</span> is not a noun with b, being understood before "earth;" neither is it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the future Hiph., which would necessitate the ellipse being supplied by <span class="accented">asher</span>; it is the Qal participle in the sense of" watering." <span class="accented">Geshem</span> is "a violent or plentiful rain," stronger than the usual word for" rain," <span class="accented">matar</span>; while <span class="accented">malqosh</span> is "the late rain" which ceases a short time before harvest. The explanation of the "dawn" by Aben Ezra is erroneous: "The intelligent man at the beginning knows God - blessed be he! - by his works, like the dawn of day in its going forth; but moment after moment the light increases, until the full truth becomes visible." Kimchi more correctly explains the figure as follows: "If we shall do this, viz. follow on to know the Lord, then he will be to us as the morning dawn, of which the going forth is fixed [purposed by God and certain] as though he said, He will cause his light and his goodness to shine over us." His comment on the second similitude is equally appropriate: "He will come to us as the plentiful rain, as the plentiful rain which revives the dead plants; so man sunk in sorrow is like one dead; but when deliverance comes to him it is with him as if he revived out of his dead state." Thus he shall be to his people as "morning to the weary watcher," and as "plentiful rain to the parched ground." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-3 Those who have gone from God by consent, and in a body, drawing one another to sin, should, by consent and in a body, return to him, which will be for his glory, and their good. It will be of great use for support under afflictions, and to encourage our repentance, to keep up good thoughts of God, and of his purposes and designs concerning us. Deliverance out of trouble should be to them as life from the dead. God will revive them: the assurance of this should engage them to return to him. But this seems to have a further reference to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Let us admire the wisdom and goodness of God, that when the prophet foretold the deliverance of the church out of her troubles, he should point out our salvation by Christ; and now these words are fulfilled in the resurrection of Christ, it confirms our faith, that this is He that should come and we are to look for no other. Here is a precious blessing promised; this is life eternal, to know God. The returns of the favour of God are secured to us as firmly as the return of the morning after a dark night. He shall come to us as the latter and former rain unto the earth, which refreshes it, and makes it fruitful. The grace of God in Christ is both the latter and the former rain; and by it the good work of our fruit-bearing is begun and carried on. And as the Redeemer was raised from the grave, so will He revive the hearts and hopes of all that trust in him. The feeblest glimpse of hope in his word, is a sure earnest of increasing light and comfort, which shall be attended with purifying, comforting grace that makes fruitful.</body></html>
