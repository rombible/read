The marginal rendering supplies the strongest meaning. God made a covenant with Adam, and promised him the blessings of Paradise on condition of obedience. He broke the condition, transgressed the covenant, and was driven from his Divine home. So Israel had violated all the terms on which the goodly land of conditional promise had been bestowed. For the other references to Adam in the Old Testament see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-7.htm" title="But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.">Psalm 82:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-33.htm" title="If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:">Job 31:33</a>. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS B (Hosea 6:7).</span><p>Buhl, in <span class= "ital">Zeitschrift fr Kirchliche Wissenschaft,</span> Part 5, 1881, throws some light on the enigmatical phrase <span class= "ital">keAdam,</span> by pointing out that <span class= "ital">Adam</span> is employed in many places to express all the other races of mankind as opposed to Israel. Thus, he translates <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm" title="Which have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and have made you a name, as at this day;">Jeremiah 32:20</a>, "Thou who didst perform wonders in Israel, as well as in Adam." Similarly <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-4.htm" title="Since you were precious in my sight, you have been honorable, and I have loved you: therefore will I give men for you, and people for your life.">Isaiah 43:4</a>, on which Delitzsch remarks that those who do not belong to the chosen people are called <span class= "ital">Adam,</span> because they are regarded as nothing but descendants of Adam. In this passage the emphatic position of the Hebrew pronoun <span class= "ital">hemmah</span> lends significance to the contrasted term <span class= "ital">Adam.</span> The meaning, therefore, is--the Israelites, who should be a chosen race, belong now, through their violation of the covenant, to the heathen: have become, in fact, <span class= "ital">Lo'Ammi.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>.) The word "there" in the last clause may refer to some local sanctuary, notorious for idolatrous corruption. This is confirmed by the mention of localities in the next verse. We prefer, however, to understand it (with the Targum of Jonathan) as referring to the Holy Land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But they like men</span> (margin, <span class="accented">like Adam</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</span> This verse is variously rendered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">They like men</span> (that is, men in general, or the rest of mankind, to whom they are in no way superior) <span class="accented">have transgressed the covenant</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">They are like men who transgress a covenant</span>; according to this rendering the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> is otiose, or adds nothing, nor is indeed required. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">They like Adam have transgressed the covenant</span>; this rendering, supported by the Vulgate, Cyril, Luther, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and Wunsche, is decidedly preferable, and yields a suitable sense. God in his great goodness had planted Adam in Paradise; but Adam violated the commandment which prohibited his eating of the tree of knowledge, and thereby transgressed the covenant of his God. Loss of fellowship with God and expulsion from Eden were the penal consequences that immediately followed. Israel, like Adam, had been settled by God in Palestine, the glory of all lands; but, ungrateful for God's great bounty and gracious gift, they broke the covenant of their God, the condition of which, as in the case of the Adamic covenant, was obedience. Thus the comparison projects the shadow of a coming event when Israel would Jose the land of promise. There is still the word "there" to be accounted for. It cannot well be rendered "therein," nor taken as a particle of time equivalent to "the," with Cyril and others. It is local, and points to the place where their breach of covenant and faithlessness had occurred. Yet this local sense is not necessarily so limited as to be referred, with some, to Bethel, as the scene of their apostasy and idolatry. "<span class="accented">There</span>, to Israel," <span class="accented">says</span> Pusey, "<span class="accented">was</span> not only Bethel, or Dan, or Gilgal, or Mizpah, or Gilead, or any or all of the places which God had hallowed by his mercies and they had defiled. It was every high hill, each idol-chapel, each field-altar, which they had multiplied to their idols. To the sinners of Israel it was every spot of the Lord's land which they had defiled by their sin." The word thus acquires a very suggestive significance, reminding Israel of God's goodness on the one hand, and of their own sinfulness and ingratitude on the other. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4-11 Sometimes Israel and Judah seemed disposed to repent under their sufferings, but their goodness vanished like the empty morning cloud, and the early dew, and they were as vile as ever. Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments. May the Lord put his fear into our hearts, and set up his kingdom within us, and never leave us to ourselves, nor suffer us to be overcome by temptation.</body></html>
