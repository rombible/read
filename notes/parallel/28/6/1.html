Their connection with the foregoing sentiments is indicated by the ancient versions - Chaldee and Septuagint, the LXX., for example, inserting <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as if the reading had been <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>: This <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> represents the Israelites exhorting one another in that good time which the prophet encourages them to expect. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may be regarded as the prophet's own exhortation to the exiles; their affliction urging them to seek the Lord, and their encouragement consisting in the knowledge of his ability and willingness to heal the wounds which his own hand had inflicted. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath torn, and he will heal us.</span> The presence of the pronoun imparts emphasis to the statement, so that it is rather, he <span class="accented">it is that hath torn</span>; and the preterit of this verse, compared with the future in ver. 14 of the foregoing chapter, implies that the destruction there predicted has become an accomplished fact. <span class="cmt_word">He hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</span> The language is figurative, and borrowed from medical science. Jehovah, not Jareb nor any sovereign of Assyria, is the physician. Long before he had assured his people Israel of this, saying, "I am the Lord that healeth thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>); and again, "I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). Aben Ezra, commenting on <span class="accented">yachbeshena</span>, alludes to the ancient mode of surgical practice, probably as indicated m <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>: A wound needs to be pressed out and bound up, and afterwards softened with oil." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-3 Those who have gone from God by consent, and in a body, drawing one another to sin, should, by consent and in a body, return to him, which will be for his glory, and their good. It will be of great use for support under afflictions, and to encourage our repentance, to keep up good thoughts of God, and of his purposes and designs concerning us. Deliverance out of trouble should be to them as life from the dead. God will revive them: the assurance of this should engage them to return to him. But this seems to have a further reference to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Let us admire the wisdom and goodness of God, that when the prophet foretold the deliverance of the church out of her troubles, he should point out our salvation by Christ; and now these words are fulfilled in the resurrection of Christ, it confirms our faith, that this is He that should come and we are to look for no other. Here is a precious blessing promised; this is life eternal, to know God. The returns of the favour of God are secured to us as firmly as the return of the morning after a dark night. He shall come to us as the latter and former rain unto the earth, which refreshes it, and makes it fruitful. The grace of God in Christ is both the latter and the former rain; and by it the good work of our fruit-bearing is begun and carried on. And as the Redeemer was raised from the grave, so will He revive the hearts and hopes of all that trust in him. The feeblest glimpse of hope in his word, is a sure earnest of increasing light and comfort, which shall be attended with purifying, comforting grace that makes fruitful.</body></html>
