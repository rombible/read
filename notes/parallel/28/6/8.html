And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.">Judges 10:17</a> that there was a town called Gilead east of the Jordan distinct altogether from Mizpah (identified by many with the city of refuge Ramoth-Gilead), and this is confirmed by notices in Eusebius and Cyril. Murder in a "city of refuge" adds to the horror. On the murderous propensities of the Gileadites see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm" title="But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.">2Kings 15:25</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - In these two verses the prophet adduces proof of that faithlessness with which he had just charged Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</span> The latter clause is more literally rendered, <span class="accented">foot-printed</span> or <span class="accented">foot-tracked from blood</span>. Two things require consideration here - the place and its pollution. Gilead is sometimes a mountain range, and sometimes the mountainous region east of the Jordan; it has Bashan on the north, the Arabian plateau on the east, and Moab on the south. It stretches from the south end of the Sea of Galilee to the north end of the Dead Sea - some sixty miles in length by twenty in breadth. The part of Gilead between the Hieromax and the Jabbok is now called <span class="accented">Jebel Ajlun</span>; while the section south of the Jabbok forms the province of <span class="accented">Belka</span>. In the New Testament it is spoken of under the name of Pertea, or beyond Jordan. Sometimes the whole trans-Jordanic territory belonging to Israel is called Gilead. In the passage before us it is the name of a city, though some take it to mean the whole land of Gilead. The men of Gilead and the Gileadites in general seem to have been fierce, wild mountaineers; and yet they are represented as still worse in this Scripture. They are nut only barbarous and wicked, but murderous and infamous for homicidal atrocities. As evidence in some sort of the justness of this dark picture, the murder of Pekahiah by Pekah with "fifty men of the Gileadites." as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>, may be specified. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some as the feminine of the adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, crafty, cunning, wily; thus Rashi explains it: "Gilead is full of people who lie in wait for murder;" and Kimchi likewise has, "Gilead is a city of evil-doers, who are crafty to murder men." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the Qal Pual participle feminine from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to seize the heel of any one, hold, tread in the footsteps, follow, go after; which is the right meaning, viz. "tracked," as given above. We retain the Authorized Version of the first clause of ver. 9, slightly modified, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As troops of robbers wait for a man, so is the company of priests</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>, wait, being an anomalous form of the infinitive Piel for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>; thus Kimchi says, "The <span class="accented">yod</span> stands in the place of <span class="accented">he</span>, and the form is the infinitive." Both Aben Ezra and Kimchi translate the first clause as above; the former beg, "The sense is, As robber-troops wait for a man who is to pass along the way, that they may plunder him, so is (or so does) the company of the priests;" the latter explains, "As troops of robbers wait for a man passing along the way to plunder him, so is the company of priests, he means to say, as the priests of the high places who combine to plunder those who pass along the way. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> another translation, which, connecting <span class="accented">ish</span> taken collectively with <span class="accented">gedhudhim</span>, and making it the subjective genitive of the infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>, is, "Like the lurking of the men of the gang, s is the company of the priests." This first clause is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> quite misread and not rendered by the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "And thy strength is that of a robber: the priests have hid the way." Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> they read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, and for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> they read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;</span>. In the second clause we prefer decidedly the translation which is intimated in the margin of the Authorized Version; thus: <span class="accented">Along the way they murder even go Shechem</span>. The word <span class="accented">derekh</span> is an adverbial accusative of place; and Sichem, the present Nablus, was situated on Mount Ephraim between Ebal and Gerizim. It was a Levitical city and a city of refuge; it thus lay on the west as Gilead on the east of Jordan, and both cities, thus perhaps nearly parallel in place on opposite sides of the river, were equal in crime and infamy. The prophet does not tell us who the wayfarers were, or whither they were bound; he only intimates that they fell victims to certain miscreant priests located in these quarters. As this city lay on the main route from the north to Jerusalem, pilgrims to the annual feasts passed along this way. The priests of the calf-win, ship, being in general persons taken from the dregs of the people, waylaid those pilgrims, whether for plunder, or through hostility to the purer worship still maintained in the holy city, or from sheer cruelty. Or it is even possible that the wayfarers referred to may have been persons going from Samaria, the northern capital, to the idolatrous worship at Bethel. In either case, on the way to their destination or on the return journey they were set upon and robbed, or, in the event of resistance, they were murdered. <span class="cmt_word">For they commit lewdness;</span> rather, <span class="accented">yea, they have committed enormity</span>. The <span class="accented">zimmah</span>, or infamy, here mentioned is referred <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some to unnatural wickedness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>); it is rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a designation of wickedness and abominations in general; thus Kimchi explains it of "evil and abominable work of every kind." He further remarks: "The prophet says, Net this alone have they done; but all their works are <span class="accented">zimmah</span>. And perhaps <span class="accented">zimmah</span> may be explained of thought, as if he said, As they have thought in their heart so they have acted." On this verse generally it may be briefly remarked <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "by consent" of the Authorized Version would require <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;</span> to be joined with "shoulder;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the connection of the first and second clauses in the Authorized Version is much the same with that of Ewald: "And as troops lie in wait the company of priests murder along the way to Sichem." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His explanation is that the priests murdered those that fled by the way before they reached the refuge, perhaps at the command of some leading persons ill disposed towards them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4-11 Sometimes Israel and Judah seemed disposed to repent under their sufferings, but their goodness vanished like the empty morning cloud, and the early dew, and they were as vile as ever. Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments. May the Lord put his fear into our hearts, and set up his kingdom within us, and never leave us to ourselves, nor suffer us to be overcome by temptation.</body></html>
