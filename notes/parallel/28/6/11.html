In regard of the last clause of the verse, "when I turn the captivity of my people," it is best to unite it with the succeeding chapter. (So Ewald, Reuss, &c.) Some writers (as recently, Nowack) explain the Hebrew word for captivity by a different etymology, and here interpret "destiny," or "fate." The full turning of the captivity cannot be realised till Ephraim and Judah accept the Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee.</span> The subject of <span class="accented">shath</span> is the indeterminate third person, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>, and our "they" or "one." The third person singular masculine, the third person plural, the second person singular masculine, and the passive voice are all used in this way. So here it is: "One hath appointed (set) a harvest for thee," or "a harvest is appointed for thee." The harvest is either recompense or retribution, and thus it is either good or evil, for as a man sows he maps. The context shows that the reaping here is punishment. Judah had sinned like Israel; and, in the case of both, a seed-time of sin produced a harvest of suffering and sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">When I returned</span> (better, <span class="accented">return, or, restore</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the captivity of my people</span>. The restoration here mentioned is thought <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some to be the bringing back of the captives; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Keil and others, with good reason, understand it to be turning of the captivity, and that figuratively, that is to say, the restoration of his people's well-being. The <span class="accented">shebhuth</span> is the misery of the Hebrew people; the <span class="accented">shubh shebhuth</span>, recovery end restoration of them to their true destroy, But this necessitates a previous purification by punishment: with this Judah, as well as Israel, shall be visited. It is as though God said, "Let not Judah claim superiority over Israel, nor expect to escape Divine judgment more than Israel. Each reaps what he sows. When Israel has received the deserved chastisement, Judah's turn shall then come also." The "turning of captivity" is a formula denoting the restoration of the lost fortune or well-being of a people or person; thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>, "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4-11 Sometimes Israel and Judah seemed disposed to repent under their sufferings, but their goodness vanished like the empty morning cloud, and the early dew, and they were as vile as ever. Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments. May the Lord put his fear into our hearts, and set up his kingdom within us, and never leave us to ourselves, nor suffer us to be overcome by temptation.</body></html>
