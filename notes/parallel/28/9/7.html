The latter is more probable. (Comp. the following verse.) Other commentators, including Maurer and Hitzig (preceded by Jerome and many Jewish as well as Christian expositors) take the words for prophet in this verse as signifying "false prophet," and would connect the clauses thus:--"Israel shall recognise that the prophet (who prophesied good to them) is a fool, the inspired one a madman, because of," &c. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew for "inspired one" (<span class= "ital">ish har-ach</span>) can bear this unfavourable sense, with the definite article affixed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-21.htm" title="And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.">1Kings 22:21</a>, Heb.); so Nowack. The passage is very difficult, and no decisive superiority can be claimed for any rendering yet proposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - These verses describe the season and source of punishment. <span class="cmt_word">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come.</span> Commentators have appropriately compared the Vergilian "Venit summa dies, et irreluctabile tempus," equivalent to" The final day and inevitable hour is come." <span class="cmt_word">Israel shall know</span> (it): <span class="cmt_word">the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad</span>. Here the prophet and the man of the spirit (margin) are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the false prophets which pretended to inspiration, and flattered the people with false hopes and vain promises of safety and prosperity; and thus helped to confirm them in their sinful courses. The object of Israel's knowledge, though not introduced by <span class="accented">ki</span>, is the folly of such false prophets, and the madness of such pretenders to prophetic inspiration. That <span class="accented">ish ruach</span> may be used of a false prophet as well as of a true one is proved from <span class="accented">ish holekh ruach</span>, a man walking in the spirit, applied by <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> to one of these pretenders: "If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people." Israel is doomed to know by bitter experience the folly and madness of those prophets who deceived and duped the people by lies soon detected, and their own folly and madness in giving ear to the delusive prospects they held forth. This explanation agrees with Kimchi's comment: "Then shall they confess, and say to the prophets of lies, who had led them astray, and had said to them, Peace (in time of greatest peril) - then shall they say unto them, A fool the prophet, a madman the man of spirit." The predicate precedes the subject for emphasis, and the article prefixed to the subject exhausts the class of those false prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Aben Ezra, Ewald, and many others understand the prophet and spiritual man to mean true prophets, which the people called fools and madmen, and treated is such, contemning and persecuting them. Thus Aben Ezra: "The days of recompense are come to you from God, who will recompense you who said to the prophet of God, He is a fool, and to the man in whom the spirit of God was, He is mad." The word me<span class="accented">shuggah</span> is properly the participle Paul used as a substantive, and kindred in meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Greek, from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be frenzied.

The visitation threatened, which was retributive - a recompense - was for the greatness of their iniquity. The last clause is thus dependent on and closely connected with the first, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ruling the construction first as a preposition, then as a conjunction: "And because the enmity is great." Ewald says, "If the first member states a reason (e.g. by using the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, on account of, because of, and the following infinitive), the meaning requires that, whenever a finite verb follows, the conjunction 'because' shall be employed in forming the continuation." The hatred was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that of Israel against their fellow-men, and their God or his prophetic messengers; though others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> understand it of the hatred of God against transgressors who had provoked his just indignation. The first exposition (a) suits the context, and is supported by the following verse. <span class="cmt_word">The watchman of Ephraim was with my God.</span> This rendering is manifestly inaccurate, as the first noun is in the absolute, not in the construct state; the right rendering, therefore, is either, "A watchman is Ephraim with my God;" or, "The watchman, O Ephraim, is with my God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If we adopt Aben Ezra's explanation of the prophet and spiritual man as true prophets whom the people jeeringly and scornfully called fools, fanatics, and madmen, the meaning of this clause of the next verse presents little difficulty. The prophet makes common cause with these divided prophets: his God was their God, and, however men treated them, they were under Divine protection. The sense of the <span class="accented">ira</span>, with, in this case is well given by Pusey as follows: "The true prophet was at all times <span class="accented">frith</span> God. He was <span class="accented">with</span> God, as holden by God, <span class="accented">watching</span> or looking out and on into the future by the help of God. He was <span class="accented">with</span> God, as walking with God in a constant sense of his presence, and in continual communion with him. He was with God, as associated by God with himself in teaching, warning, correcting, exhorting his people, as the apostle says, We then are workers together with him. In the next clause the false prophet is described by way of contrast as a snare. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> is properly a participle, and Ephraim is thus exhibited by the prophet as on the outlook, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> not for counsel and help beside or apart from God, as Gesenius understands it; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> as on the outlook for revelations and prophecies along with my God; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Ephraim, not satisfied with the genuine prophets, had prophets of his own, which spake to the people according to their wish. This exposition is in the main supported by Rashi and Kimchi: the former says, "They appoint for themselves prophets of their own;" and Kimchi more fully thus, "Ephraim has appointed for himself a watchman (or seer) at the side of his God; and he is the false prophet who speaks his prophecy in the name of his God." (But) <span class="cmt_word">the prophet is a snare of a fowler in</span> (over) <span class="cmt_word">all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.</span> Whether we adopt <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (1)</span> or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (2)</span> as the explanation of the first clause, we may understand the prophet of this clause as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">false</span> prophet who - by way of contrast if we accept <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, or by way of continuation if we prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (2)</span> - is like the snare of a bird-catcher over all the people's path, to entangle, entrap, and draw them into destruction <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> He is, moreover, inspired with hostility - a man of rancorous spirit against God and his true prophets. "This prophet of lies," says Aben Ezra, "is a snare of the bird-catcher." Similarly Kimchi says in his exposition, "This prophet is for Ephraim on all his ways as the snare of the bird-catcher that catcheth the fowls; so they catch Ephraim in the words of their prophets." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some understand "prophet" in the middle clause of the verse as the <span class="accented">true</span> prophet, and the snare as the hostility and traps which the people prepared for the messengers of God; so Rashi: "For the true prophets they lay snares to catch them." According to this exposition we must render, "As for the prophet, the snare of the bird-catcher is over all his ways." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> In the last clause, "house of his God," may mean the temple of the true God, or the idol-temple; thus Aben Ezra: "Enmity is in the house of his god;" while Kimchi thinks either sense admissible: "We may understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> of the house of the calves, which were his god, and the false prophet acted there as prophet, and caused enmity between himself and God; or we may explain it of the house of the true God, that is, the house of the sanctuary." Thus the hostility may refer to the prophet himself, of which he is the subject as (<span class="accented">a</span>) or the object according to Kimchi just cited, or the detestable idol-worship, or perhaps the Divine displeasure against the false prophet and the people led astray by him. <span class="cmt_word">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah.</span> The historical event here alluded to was the abominable and infamous treatment of the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah. This was the foulest blot on Israel's history during all the rule of the judges. For the loathsome particulars, <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. may be consulted. The construction is peculiar. The two verbs <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;</span> are coordinated appositionally; "The leading verb, which in meaning is the leading one, is subordinated more palpably by being placed alongside of the preceding verb without a joining <span class="accented">and"</span> (Ewald). The former verb is often constructed with an infinitive, and sometimes with a noun. Some trace the reference, as already stated, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the enormity of the men of Gibeah in relation to the Levite's concubine; others to the election of Saul, who was of Gibeah, to be king. Rashi mentions both: "Some say it was Gibeah of Benjamin in the matter of the concubine; but others say it was Gibeah of Saul, when they demanded for themselves a king and rebelled against the words of the prophet." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</span> The sin of Gibeah was fearfully avenged; its punishment re-suited in almost the total extinction of a tribe in Israel - that of Benjamin. And as Israel had paralleled that of the men of Gibeah, he gives them to understand first implicitly that like punishment would overtake them, then he explicitly denounces visitation for their iniquity and retribution for their sin. The clause thus closes, as it commenced, with the sad note of coming calamity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:7-10 Time had been when the spiritual watchmen of Israel were with the Lord, but now they were like the snare of a fowler to entangle persons to their ruin. The people were become as corrupt as those of Gibeah, Jud 19; and their crimes should be visited in like manner. At first God had found Israel pleasing to Him, as grapes to the traveller in the wilderness. He saw them with pleasure as the first ripe figs. This shows the delight God took in them; yet they followed after idolatry.</body></html>
