The bounteous yield of the harvest is called the "harlot's hire," which lures Jehovah's faithless bride to worship the false deity from whose hands these gifts were supposed to come. The people's momentary prosperity is attributed to their idols. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-12.htm" title="And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she has said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.">Hosea 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17-19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9</span> contain a warning against security arising from temporary prosperity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people.</span> The occasion on which the prophet penned this section was so no idolatrous merry-making in connection with harvest, and not any change of political situation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The literal rendering of the first clause is, <span class="accented">rejoice not unto exultation</span>, or <span class="accented">exceedingly</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the same expression is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-22.htm">Job 3:22</a>; it is thus climactic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The old versions take <span class="accented">el-gil as</span> imperative, and read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "nor make merry;" and the Vulgate has <span class="accented">noli exultare</span>; but <span class="accented">al is</span> constructed with the future, not with the imperative. Again, some read <span class="accented">be</span> instead of <span class="accented">ke</span>, and so render, "among the peoples," the words being addressed, not to Israel in exile, but still resident in their own land. <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast gone a-whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every corn-floor.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> According to this, which is the common rendering. the clause with <span class="accented">ki</span> assigns a reason for their foregoing such joy. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald and others translate by "that or for that thou hast committed whoredom," understanding this clause to express the object of their joy. We prefer the former, for their faithlessness and foul idolatry were sufficient reasons to prevent Israel indulging in the joy of harvest. The blessings of the harvest were regarded by them as rewards for the worship of their idol-gods, in other words, as gifts from Baalim and Ashtaroth or other idols, and thus as <span class="accented">ethnan</span>, a harlot's hire; not as tokens and pledges of the favor of Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 Israel gave rewards to their idols, in the offerings presented to them. It is common for those who are stingy in religion, to be prodigal upon their lusts. Those are reckoned as idolaters, who love a reward in the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and in eternal life. They are full of the joy of harvest, and have no disposition to mourn for sin. When we make the world, and the things of it, our idol and our portion, it is just with God to show us our folly, and correct us. None may expect to dwell in the Lord's land, who will not be subject to the Lord's laws, or be influenced by his love. When we enjoy the means of grace, we ought to consider what we shall do, if they should be taken from us. While the pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of change, the pleasant places purchased with silver, or in which men deposit silver, are liable to be laid in ruins. No famine is so dreadful as that of the soul.</body></html>
