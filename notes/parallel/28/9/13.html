They render "Ephraim, even as I saw, gave their children for a prey." The reference to Tyre is very obscure. Some would render the Hebrew word for "meadow" by "resting-place," and interpret, "I look on Ephraim even as I look on Tyre, planted in a sure resting-place." The impregnable fortress of Tyre was a conspicuous object in the days of Hosea. Similarly Samaria was a stronghold which was able <span class= "ital">to</span> resist prolonged sieges. (Comp.

God departs from a people, or from a person, when he withdraws his goodness and mercy from them; and when the Lord is departed, what can the creature do? Even though, for the present, good things seem to remain, yet the blessing is gone if God is gone. Even the children should perish with the parents. The Divine wrath dries up the root, and withers the fruit of all comforts; and the scattered Jews daily warn us to beware, lest we neglect or abuse the gospel. Yet every smiting is not a drying up of the root. It may be that God intends only to smite so that the sap may be turned to the root, that there may be more of root graces, more humility, patience, faith, and self-denial. It is very just that God should bring judgments on those who slight his offered mercy.</body></html>
