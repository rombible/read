and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a>. "My house" here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm" title="Set the trumpet to your mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.">Hosea 8:1</a> ("Jehovah's house"), is interpreted by Wnsche and Nowack, with considerable show of reason, to mean the "holy land," Canaan. This interpretation is confirmed by the use of the Assyrian word <span class= "ital">Bitu,</span> corresponding to the Hebrew <span class= "ital">beth</span> "house." The term seems to have blended the conception of a people and the territory they occupied. (See Schrader, <span class= "ital">Keilinschriften und das alte Testament,</span> p. 540, where the examples are cited <span class= "ital">Bit-Am-ma-na "</span>Ammon," <span class= "ital">Bit-A-di-ni,</span> "Beth-Eden.") Similarly, Egypt is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm" title="I am the LORD your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.">Exodus 20:2</a>, "the house of slaves." We are reminded by the word "house" of the domestic episode (Hosea 1-3): Ephraim, like an adulterous wife, is turned out of house and home (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>), and is no longer Jehovah's people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - After the interruption by the excited question of the prophet in ver. 14, the terrible storm of denunciation sweeps on to the end of the chapter. <span class="cmt_word">All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them</span>; or, <span class="accented">there I conceived hatred against them</span>, the verb being used in an inchoative sense. Gilgal had been the scene of many mercies; there the rite of circumcision, the seal of the Abrahamic covenant, after its omission dining the sojourn in the wilderness, was renewed; there the Passover, also intermitted from its second observance at Sinai, was kept; there the twelve memorial stones had been set up; there the Captain of the host of the Lord had appeared to Joshua, reassuring him of Divine protection; there the tabernacle had stood before its removal to Shiloh; yet that very place - a place of such blessing and solemn covenanting-had become the scene of idolatry and iniquity. The wickedness of Israel had been concentrated there as in a focus; there Israel's rejection of the theocracy in its spiritual form had taken place; there that first-plague's pot of ruin had been contracted; there the calf-worship had been developed; there the form of civil government had been shaped according to their own erring fancy, and their mode of religious worship had been corrupted. Thus Gilgal had become the center of all their sin; but the scene of mercy became the source of wrath, for there God's fatherly love was turned by Israel's wickedness into hatred. <span class="cmt_word">For the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more.</span> They were driven out like Hagar out of the house of the patriarch, that Ishmael might not inherit with Isaac; like an unfaithful wife divorced and driven out of the house of the husband whom she has dishonored; or like an undutiful and disobedient son whom his father has disinherited. Further, God disowns the rebellious son, and acknowledges the paternal relationship no longer. The princes of Israel had become rebellions and stubborn: by an impressive Hebrew paronomasia, their <span class="accented">sarim</span>, rulers, had become <span class="accented">sorerim</span>, revolters. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit.</span> Ephraim is a pleasant plant, but a worm has smitten the root and it has withered; Ephraim is a goodly tree, but the lightning of heaven has scorched and dried it up; there may be leafage for a time, but no fruitage ever. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.</span> The desires - margin, <span class="accented">dear delights</span>, or, <span class="accented">darlings - perish</span>, and so the figure is now dropped, and the fact is seen in all its severe and stern reality, while the dread denunciation of vers. 11 and 12 is repeated and emphasized. <span class="cmt_word">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span> The prophet submits his will to the Divine will, and acquiesces in the disposals of his providence, and in his own proper person predicts Israel's coming doom. He fills up the outline of the dark picture by stating the cause of their rejection. He specifies at the same time the character of rejection, namely, dispersion among the nations, like birds driven from their nest, for so the term <span class="accented">nodedim</span> denotes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-17. God departs from a people, or from a person, when he withdraws his goodness and mercy from them; and when the Lord is departed, what can the creature do? Even though, for the present, good things seem to remain, yet the blessing is gone if God is gone. Even the children should perish with the parents. The Divine wrath dries up the root, and withers the fruit of all comforts; and the scattered Jews daily warn us to beware, lest we neglect or abuse the gospel. Yet every smiting is not a drying up of the root. It may be that God intends only to smite so that the sap may be turned to the root, that there may be more of root graces, more humility, patience, faith, and self-denial. It is very just that God should bring judgments on those who slight his offered mercy.</body></html>
