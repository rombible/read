Another reference to the Mosaic legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-14.htm" title="I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have listened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me.">Deuteronomy 26:14</a>)--<span class= "ital">Yea, their bread is for their appetite</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e., only for bodily sustenance</span>)<span class= "ital">, it cometh not to Jehovah's house</span> as a sacred offering.<span class= "note">[12]</span> These verses show that Hosea did not consider the worship of the Northern Kingdom as in itself illegal.<p><span class= "note">[12] Kuenen (Hibbert Lecture, p. 312) proposes an alteration in the text, whereby the parallelism becomes more harmonious and the construction simpler. He then renders, "They shall pour no libation of wine to Jehovah, and shall not lay out their sacrifices before Him: as food eaten in mourning is their food." This agrees better with </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a><span class= "note">.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them the broad of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted</span>. Having predicted their inability to observe the ritual distinctions between clean and unclean, which the Law prescribed, whether from the tyranny of their oppressors or from scarcity, or from the absence of sanctification by the presentation of the firstfruits, the prophet proceeds to predict their cessation altogether. Such is the prophet's picture of their miserable position in Assyria. It is aptly remarked by Grotius that "they failed to pour out libations to the Lord when they could; now the time shall come when they may wish to make such libations, but cannot." According to the Massoretic punctuation and the common rendering, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> which is that of the Authorized Version, the people themselves are the subject of the second verb. They were neither able to offer drink offerings, a part for the whole of the meat offerings and unbloody oblations; nor, if they did, could they hope for acceptance for them away from the sanctuary and its central altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig supplies <span class="accented">niskeyhens</span>, their drink offerings, from the foregoing clause, as subject to the verb of the following one, and the verb is explained by some in the sense of "mire." If <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we neglect the <span class="accented">segholta</span>, and make <span class="accented">zibh</span>-<span class="accented">chehem</span> the subject, the meaning is clearer, and the contrast between the unbloody and bloody offerings more obvious; thus: "They will not pour out libations of wine to Jehovah, nor will their sacrifices [equivalent to 'bloody oblations'] please him," that is to say, not such as were actually offered, but such as they might feel dis. posed to offer. The same noun may be repeated in next clause; thus, their sacrifices, or rather slaughtered meats, are unto him as bread of mourners, or, what is better, <span class="accented">their food</span> (supplied from <span class="accented">ke</span> <span class="accented">lechem</span>) <span class="accented">shall be unto them like bread of mourners</span>. Mourners' bread is that eaten at a funeral feast, or meal by persons mourning for the dead, and which was legally unclean, since a corpse defiled the house in which it was and all who entered it for seven days, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14</a>, "This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days." Of course, all who partook of the food would be polluted; so with that of Israel in exile, being unsanctified by the offering of firstfruits. <span class="cmt_word">For their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord.</span> "Their bread for their soul," that is, for appeasing their appetite, whatsoever their soul lusted after, or bread for the preservation of their life, would not come into the house of the Lord to be sanctified by representative offerings. <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord?</span> On such occasions they would feel the misery of their position most keenly. Away in a far foreign land, without temple and without ritual, they would bewail the loss of their annual celebrations, their national festivals and religious solemnities - those holiday-times of general joy and spiritual gladness. The distinction between <span class="accented">moed</span> and <span class="accented">chag</span> is variously given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> By Grotius and Rosenm&uuml;ller mood is referred to one of the three annual feasts - Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles; and chug to any of the other feasts, including the new moon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others restrict <span class="accented">chag</span> to the Feast of Tabernacles, or harvest festival, the most joyous of them all. Keil makes the words synonymous, except that in <span class="accented">chag</span> festival joy is made prominent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 Israel gave rewards to their idols, in the offerings presented to them. It is common for those who are stingy in religion, to be prodigal upon their lusts. Those are reckoned as idolaters, who love a reward in the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and in eternal life. They are full of the joy of harvest, and have no disposition to mourn for sin. When we make the world, and the things of it, our idol and our portion, it is just with God to show us our folly, and correct us. None may expect to dwell in the Lord's land, who will not be subject to the Lord's laws, or be influenced by his love. When we enjoy the means of grace, we ought to consider what we shall do, if they should be taken from us. While the pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of change, the pleasant places purchased with silver, or in which men deposit silver, are liable to be laid in ruins. No famine is so dreadful as that of the soul.</body></html>
