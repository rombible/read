That many exiles took refuge in Egypt in 721 B.C., after the great overthrow of the northern kingdom (as in the case of Judah in the days of Jeremiah), cannot admit of doubt. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-13.htm" title="They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepts them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.">Hosea 8:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm" title="They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.">Hosea 9:3</a> above; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-5.htm" title="He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.">Hosea 11:5</a>, Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them.</span> Their future exile was seen in prophetic vision; and in consequence and because of its certainty he speaks of it as having already taken place. The destruction is the desolation and wasting of their native land, because of which, or away from which and leaving it behind, they are gone. The land of their banishment was the land of their bondage. There, far from the land of their birth, they were doomed to die and to be gathered together for a common burial. Memphis was the ancient capital of Lower Egypt; its situation was on the western bank of the Nile, and south of Old Cairo. There its ruins are still seen, with extensive burial-grounds, while amid those ruins is the village of Mitrahenni. Kimchi identifies Moph with Noph. <span class="cmt_word">The pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.</span> The literal rendering of the first clause is, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">their cherished delight of silver</span>. By this some understand <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> silver idols; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> others, valuables in silver; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the Jewish commentators, the houses of the precious treasures of their silver - so Rashi; "Their precious buildings where their silver treasures were" - so Kimchi; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Jerome understands their mansions and all the ornaments of their mansions purchased by silver; Keil also has, "houses ornamented and filled with the precious metals." This explanation is pretty generally accepted, and appears to us to deserve the preference. Their former homes, so pleasant and so richly decorated, were so utterly desolate and deserted that thorns and thistles overspread them. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sentence is differently translated and explained by Rosenm&uuml;ller and some others; thus: "Moph (Memphis) will bury them out of desire for their silver." This violent divulsion destroys the parallelism of the second hemistich, besides ignoring the athnach. The LXX., again <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> puzzled by the word <span class="accented">maehmad</span>, mistook it for a proper name: "Therefore, behold, they go forth from the trouble of Egypt, and Hemphis shall receive them, and Machmas (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) shall bury them." Giving a decided preference to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> (d), we have a thrilling picture of distress. First comes the destruction of their native city; having looked their last look on the ruins where once stood their home, they have set forth - a miserable band of pilgrims - to the land of the stranger, and that stranger their conqueror and oppressor; they have reached the place of exile, there to find, not a home, but a grave, and not a single grave for each, according to the Jews' mode of sepulture to the present day, but a common place of burial into which they are huddled together, Egypt gathering them and Memphis burying them; while in the land that gave them birth, their once happy homesteads, richly decorated and expensively adorned, are left utterly desolate - a heritage for thorns and thistles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 Israel gave rewards to their idols, in the offerings presented to them. It is common for those who are stingy in religion, to be prodigal upon their lusts. Those are reckoned as idolaters, who love a reward in the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and in eternal life. They are full of the joy of harvest, and have no disposition to mourn for sin. When we make the world, and the things of it, our idol and our portion, it is just with God to show us our folly, and correct us. None may expect to dwell in the Lord's land, who will not be subject to the Lord's laws, or be influenced by his love. When we enjoy the means of grace, we ought to consider what we shall do, if they should be taken from us. While the pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of change, the pleasant places purchased with silver, or in which men deposit silver, are liable to be laid in ruins. No famine is so dreadful as that of the soul.</body></html>
