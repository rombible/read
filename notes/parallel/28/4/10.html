it is thus an expansion of the closing clause of the preceding verse, with an obvious allusion to the sin specified in the eighth verse. To eat and not be satisfied may occur in time of famine, or be the effect of disease or the consequence of insatiable craving. "Since," says Kimchi, "they eat in an unlawful manner, their food shall not be to them a blessing." This was one of the punishments threatened for violation of the Law, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, "When I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied." Further, the multiplication of wives or concubines would not increase their posterity; Solomon long previously had been a notable exemplification of this. "So in their cohabitation with their women, since it is in a whorish manner, they shall not increase, for they shall not have children by them; or, if they have, they shall die from the birth." The Hiph. <span class="accented">hiznu</span> has rather the intensive sense of Qal than that of causing or encouraging whoredom. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have left off to take heed to the Lord.</span> The verbal <span class="accented">lishmor</span> either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> has Jehovah for its object, as in the Authorized Version; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">durko</span> or <span class="accented">darkair</span> may be supplied, as is done by Kimchi and Aben Ezra. The former has, "To observe his <span class="accented">ways</span>, for they have no delight in him and in his ways; to observe his ways they have left off;" the latter <span class="accented">has</span>, "They have forsaken Jehovah, to observe his way or his Laws." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kimchi informs us that "Saadiah Gaon of blessed memory has connected the word with the verse that comes after it; they have forsaken the Lord to observe whoredom and wine and new wine." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-11 Both priests and people rejected knowledge; God will justly reject them. They forgot the law of God, neither desired nor endeavoured to retain it in mind, and to transmit the remembrance to their posterity; therefore God will justly forget them and their children. If we dishonour God with that which is our honour, it will, sooner or later, be turned into shame to us. Instead of warning the people against sin, from the consideration of the sacrifices, which showed what an offence sin was to God, since it needed an atonement, the priests encouraged the people to sin, since atonement might be made at so small an expense. It is very wicked to be pleased with the sins of others, because they may turn to our advantage. What is unlawfully gained, cannot be comfortably used. The people and the priests hardened one another in sin; therefore justly shall they share in the punishment. Sharers in sin must expect to share in ruin. Any lust harboured in the heart, in time will eat out all its strength and vigour. That is the reason why many professors grow so heavy, so dull, so dead in the way of religion. They have a liking for some secret lust, which takes away their hearts.</body></html>
