The fern. "her" in these verses refers to Ephraim, in accordance with the common Hebrew idiom. The change of person to the masculine plural is characteristic of the style of Hebrew prophecy. The storm-wind hath seized upon her with its wings--carried her away like a swarm of locusts or a baffled bird.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - The first of these two verses gives a picture of the degeneracy of the times; the second predicts the destruction that would ensue. <span class="cmt_word">Their drink is sour</span> (margin, <span class="accented">is gone</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they have committed whoredom continually.</span> If the first clause be taken literally, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it denotes a charge of drunkenness preferred against Ephraim. To this vice the people of the northern kingdom, as is well known, were addicted: the wine, from oft-repeated potations, became sour in the stomach and produced loathsome eructations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some, connecting closely the first and second clauses, and translating as in the margin, explain the meaning to be that "when their intoxication is gone they commit whoredom." But though drunkenness and debauchery frequently go together, it is rather during the former than afterwards that the latter is indulged in. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The first clause had better be understood figuratively, and the latter either literally or figuratively, or both. Thus the sense is the degeneracy of principle among the people in general, or rather among the principal men of that day. By the finest wine becoming vapid, the prophet represents the leading men of the nation, on whom so much depended and from whom so much might be expected, as becoming unprincipled, and as being addicted to immorality or idolatry, or probably both (<span class="accented">hazneh hiznu</span>): "whoring they have committed whoredom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">Her rulers</span> (margin, <span class="accented">shields</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with shame do love, Give ye</span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">her shields lore</span>, <span class="accented">love shame</span>. The first takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, as imperative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to give, and should rather be, "Her shields love, ' Give ye - shame, as there is no preposition before the word "shame;" even thus it is awkward. Most modern expositors take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> as a contraction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d5;</span>, and so a repetition of part of the full verb preceding; thus: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "loved, loved." Ewald, Delitzsch, and Pusey understand it so; the latter says this "is probably one of the earliest forms of the intensive verb, repeating a part of the verb itself with its inflection." And Keil calls it "a construction resembling the <span class="accented">pealal</span> form." Among the <span class="accented">sebirin</span>, or conjectural readings, we find both words united into one; thus: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "mightily love." The shields are the princes, or natural protectors of the state, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>, "The princes of the people are gathered together.., for the shields of the earth be. long unto God." The shame they loved was the sin which is a shame to either princes or people, causes shame, and ends in shame. Isaiah expounds the thought (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>), a comparison of which confirms the above exposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">The wind hath bound her up in her wings</span>; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">she hath bound up the wind with her in her skirts</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the one case the wind is the strong storm-wind of Divine wrath that will seize on Ephraim, wrap her up with its wings, and carry her away. In the other, Ephraim wraps up the wind, that is, disappointment, the result of her sin, in the fold of her skirt. The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> translation of the first clause of ver. 19 is supported by Rashi: "The storm takes her in its wings, as that bird which the wind does not let rest until it makes him go far away; so the enemies will come upon them and carry them into exile." Translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is favored by Aben Ezra and Kimchi; the former says, "As the man who binds the wind in the folds of his robe without finding anything therein." <span class="cmt_word">And they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</span> Frustrated in her hopes, and disappointed by the idols, from which she hoped so much and got so little, she is ashamed of the sacrifices she offered them; not of the altars (LXX.), for the preposition <span class="accented">rain</span> is indispensable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 The people consulted images, and not the Divine word. This would lead to disorder and sin. Thus men prepare scourges for themselves, and vice is spread through a people. Let not Judah come near the idolatrous worship of Israel. For Israel was devoted to idols, and must now be let alone. When sinners cast off the easy yoke of Christ, they go on in sin till the Lord saith, Let them alone. Then they receive no more warnings, feel no more convictions: Satan takes full possession of them, and they ripen for destruction. It is a sad and sore judgment for any man to be let alone in sin. Those who are not disturbed in their sin, will be destroyed for their sin. May we be kept from this awful state; for the wrath of God, like a strong tempest, will soon hurry impenitent sinners into ruin.</body></html>
