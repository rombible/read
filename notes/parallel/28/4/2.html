The absence of the virtues specified implies the presence of the opposite vices. In the most vivid and impressive manner the prophet, instead of enumerating prosaically the vices so prevalent at the time, expresses them more emphatically by a species of exclamation, using <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> infinitives absolute instead of finite verbs; thus: "Swearing, and lying, and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery." They may, however, be regarded as in the nominative as subjects to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. Instead of either supplying <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, to allot, or closely connecting" allot" with the verb "to lie," which immediately follows, it is better to understand the two verbs separately, as expressing two different species of sin; that is, swearing and cursing, and lying. So the Septuagint renders them by the nouns <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">cursing</span> and lying;" as also the Chaldee, "<span class="accented">they</span> swear falsely and lie." The commandments which the children of Israel thus violated were the third, the ninth, the sixth, the eighth, and the seventh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The construction, adopted in the LXX., Vulgate, and by Luther in his version, takes the infinitives (nounal expressions of habitual or continued actions) as nominatives to the verb <span class="accented">paratsu</span>; thus: "<span class="accented">Cursing</span>, and lying, and murder, and theft, and adultery abound (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) in the land;" "Maledictum, et mendacium, et homicidium, et furtum, et adulterium innndavernut;" and Luther translates, "Gotteslastern, Luger, Morder, Stehlen, and Ehebrechen hat uberhand genommen." The common mode <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of constructing the infinitives independently as above in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> or gerundively as in the Authorized Version, and in either ease understanding an indefinite subject to <span class="accented">paratsu</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> preferable on the whole; thus: "By swearing, etc., they break out." The allusion to the water overflowing its banks and spreading in all directions, implied in the Septuagint Version, is approved by Jerome in his Commentary: "He (the prophet) did not say <span class="accented">est</span>, but, to demonstrate the abundance of crimes, introduced <span class="accented">inundaverunt</span> (overflowed)." The common meaning of <span class="accented">parats</span> is to tear or break - break in upon, especially with violence, as robbers and murderers; <span class="accented">so paritsim</span> has the sense of murderers and robbers. It is better, therefore, to take the verb here as a present perfect connecting past and present, and to translate it" break through," or" in to," that is, as burglars into houses. So Kimchi, though figuratively: "They break through the wall which is the fence of the Law, and multiply transgressions." Similarly, De Wette has "Gewaltthat uber sie;" and Maurer likewise: "Jurare et mentiri et occidere et furari et adulterari! <span class="accented">Violenter agunt</span> et sanguines sanguines altingunt." The Massoretic accentuation favors (putting <span class="accented">athnach</span> at <span class="accented">naopt</span>) this construction; while the context, which speaks of bloodshed, is quite in keeping with acts of violence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 Hosea reproves for immorality, as well as idolatry. There was no truth, mercy, or knowledge of God in the land: it was full of murders, 2Ki 21:16. Therefore calamities were near, which would desolate the country. Our sins, as separate persons, as a family, as a neighbourhood, as a nation, cause the Lord to have a controversy with us; let us submit and humble ourselves before Him, that he may not go on to destroy.</body></html>
