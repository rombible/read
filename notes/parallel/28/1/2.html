Is it an historic occurrence, the only too real tragedy of the author's personal experience, employed for the purpose of illustration? (Comp. the domestic incident, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said to me, Take you a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:1-4</a>.) Or is this opening chapter a merely allegorical representation, designed to exhibit in vivid colours the terrible moral condition of Israel? (Comp. the symbolic actions described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/4-4.htm" title="Lie you also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it you shall bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1-3</a>.) Able writers have advocated each of these opposed theories; but in our opinion the balance of evidence inclines to the former view, which regards the events as historic. The further question arises, Was Gomer guilty before or after the marriage? The former supposition involves the harshness of conceiving such a marriage as the result of a Divine command; but the latter supposition admits of a satisfactory interpretation. The wickedness which <span class= "ital">after</span> marriage revealed itself to the prophet's agonised heart was transfigured to the inspired seer into an emblem of his nation's wrong to Jehovah. In the light of this great idea, the prophet's past came before him in changed aspect. As he reflected on the marvellous symbolic adaptation of this episode to the terrible spiritual needs of his fellow-countrymen, which he was called by God to supply, the Divine purpose which shaped his sorrowful career became interpreted to his glowing consciousness as a Divine command--"Go, take unto thyself a wife of whoredoms." He had suffered acutely, but the agony was part of God's arrangement, and the very love that was repeatedly outraged proves ultimately to have been suggested by a Divine monition.<p><span class= "bld">Children of whoredoms.--</span>Children of Hosea's marriage. The whole result of his family history was included in this divinely ordered plan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The beginning of the word of the Lord by</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Hosea</span>. These words may be rendered at once more literally and more exactly, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">beginning</span> (of that which) Jehovah spoke by Hosea." Thus Gesenius translates, understanding ashen, which is often omitted as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative, indicating relation, and as including the antecedent personal or demonstrative pronoun. When the pronoun thus supplied is in the genitive, the preceding noun is in the construct state, as here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller, without necessity, takes the noun in the adverbial sense; thus: "In the beginning Jehovah spake by Hosea." He also suggests the possibility of <span class="accented">dibber</span> being a noun of the same meaning as <span class="accented">dabar</span>, but of different formation; while in two manuscripts of De Rossi and one of Kennicott the regular form of the construct state of <span class="accented">davar</span> is expressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil takes the noun as an accusative of time, and accounts for its construct state by the substantival idea of the succeeding subordinated clause; thus: "<span class="accented">At</span> the commencement of ' Jehovah spake,' Jehovah said to him." But what is the beginning here mentioned? It cannot mean that Hoses was the first of the prophets by whom God made known his will to Israel, or the first of the minor prophets; for Jonah, as is rightly inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>, preceded him; Joel also is usually regarded as before him in point of time; neither can it denote his priority to Isaiah and <span class="accented">Amos</span>, who also prophesied in the days of Uzziah. The plain meaning is that which becomes obvious when we adopt the right rendering of Gesenius, as given above, that is, the beginning of the prophecies which Hoses was commissioned by Jehovah to make known. The peculiarity of the expression, "<span class="accented">in</span> Hosea," as the word literally means, deserves attention. Maurer compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-2.htm">Numbers 12:2, 6</a>, and 8, to prove that the expression signifies speaking to rather than in or <span class="accented">by</span>; he also cites other passages to the same purpose, But while the verb "to speak," followed by b5 and the verb constructed with <span class="accented">el</span>, may coincide in signification at a certain point, it does not thence follow that they are everywhere and always synonymous. Long ago Jerome drew attention to the distinction which this difference of construction suggests. "It is one thing," says that Father, "for the Lord to speak <span class="accented">in</span> Hosea, another to speak to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Hosea: when it is in Hosea he does not speak to Hosea himself, but <span class="accented">by</span> Hosea to others; but speaking <span class="accented">to</span> Hosea denotes communication to himself. So in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>) we find the corresponding Greek expression, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which the Revised Version rightly renders, "God having... spoken the ... in the prophets." The first verse is the general heading for the whole book; the first clause of the second verse is the special heading of the first section of the book, which extends to the end of the third chapter. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms.</span> Whether the transaction here enjoined is to be understood as a reality, or a vision, or an allegory, has been keenly debated. To enter fully into the discussion of this point would lead us too far from our purpose; nor could it minister to edification. Though high authorities have maintained it to be a real occurrence, we do not see our way to concur with their view. A canon of interpretation sanctioned by Augustine forbids the literal acceptation of this command, for, according to the canon referred to, if the language of Scripture taken literally would involve something incongruous or morally improper, the figurative sense must be preferred. Again, we can scarcely understand it of a vision; for there is no mention of or reference to anything of that kind in the passage, nor does the context countenance the notion of a vision. Keil regards it as such when he speaks of it as "an inward and spiritual intuition in which the word of God was addressed" to the prophet. We are, therefore, shut up to that interpretation which explains the whole as an allegorical or imaginary narrative, which is thus constructed in order to impart greater vividness to the prophet's declaration. The Chaldee paraphrase understands it in this sense. "Go," says the paraphrast, "declare a prophecy against the inhabitants of the idolatrous city, who persist in sin." Jerome also explains it allegorically, and urges against the literal sense that passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>, where the prophet is commanded by God to bear the iniquity of the house of Israel, and to lie upon his left side three hundred and ninety days - a thing impossible according to the literal understanding of the injunction; he accordingly concludes, in reference to the particulars here commanded, that "sacramenta indicaut futurorum." Calvin rightly understands it in the sense of a parabolic representation as follows: '" The Lord had bidden him (the prophet) to relate this parable, so to speak, or this similitude, that the people might see, as in a living portraiture, their turpitude and perfidiousness. It is, in short, an exhibition in which the thing itself is not only set forth in words, but is also placed, as it were, before their eyes in a visible form." Kimchi considers it to be a prophetic vision; while some of the older Hebrew interpreters viewed it in the light of an actual transaction. Kimchi's words are: "And the whole took place in the vision of prophecy, not that Hoses the prophet had taken to himself a wife of whoredoms; although it is found in the words of our rabbins that the meaning is according to the literal signification of the words." By "a wife of whoredoms" we understand a woman addicted to whoredoms, and thus likely to prove an unfaithful wife, as" a woman of quarrels" is a quarrelsome woman, "a man of bloods" is a bloody man, "a man of sorrows" a sorrowful man; while "children of whoredoms" are children who follow in the footsteps of their mother's lewdness, or children on whose birth their mother's licentiousness bad left a stigma so <span class="accented">that</span> their legitimacy is questionable. The construction of the verb "take," with both objects, is an example of the figure zeugma, by which one word does duty to two clauses, though it undergoes a modification of sense in its application to the second. The meaning here is clearly that the prophet should take a wife of the character indicated, and beget children by her, not <span class="accented">take</span> such a wife and such children already born to her. This view is favored by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sume tibi uxorem fornicationum et fac tibi filios fornicationum</span>; though Keil maintains that Hosea was to take children of prostitution as well as a wife who had lived by prostitution. <span class="cmt_word">For the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord.</span> This is more exactly rendered, <span class="accented">for the land hath utterly gone a-whoring from after</span> (that is, <span class="accented">from following</span>) <span class="accented">the Lord</span>. From this we learn the symbolic import of the command, in whatever way that command is interpreted, whether as a reality, or vision, or allegory, the prophet's marriage to an unfaithful wife sets forth Jehovah's marriage to an unfaithful nation. God often condescends - graciously condescends - to represent his relation to his people as a marriage covenant; while unfaithfulness on their part is spiritual adultery. The mother and the children may represent the country and its inhabitants, or the nation as a whole and its several members, or generally the people and their <span class="accented">posterity</span> in succeeding generations. The father of the Hebrew race had served other gods on the other side of the flood, that is, in Ur, in the land of the Chaldees, whence God had called Abraham. When taken into covenant relationship, how often had they fallen into the former sin of idolatry! The fearful consequences of their sin is graphically portrayed in the verses immediately following, symbolized in the names of the prophet's children. They are - national ruin, the loss of the Divine favor, and the forfeiture of their proud position as the chosen people of Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Israel was prosperous, yet then Hosea boldly tells them of their sins, and foretells their destruction. Men are not to be flattered in sinful ways because they prosper in the world; nor will it last long if they go on still in their trespasses. The prophet must show Israel their sin; show it to be exceedingly hateful. Their idolatry is the sin they are here charged with. Giving that glory to any creature which is due to God alone, is an injury and affront to God; such as for a wife to take a stranger, is to her husband. The Lord, doubtless, had good reasons for giving such a command to the prophet; it would form an affecting picture of the Lord's unmerited goodness and unwearied patience, and of the perverseness and ingratitude of Israel. We should be broken and wearied with half that perverseness from others, with which we try the patience and grieve the Spirit of our God. Let us also be ready to bear any cross the Lord appoints. The prophet must show the ruin of the people, in the names given to his children. He foretells the fall of the royal family in the name of his first child: call his name Jezreel, which signifies dispersion. He foretells God's abandoning the nation in the name of the second child; Lo-ruhamah, not beloved, or not having obtained mercy. God showed great mercy, but Israel abused his favours. Sin turns away the mercy of God, even from Israel, his own professing people. If pardoning mercy is denied, no other mercy can be expected. Though some, through unbelief, are broken off, yet God will have a church in this world till the end of time. Our salvation is owing to God's mercy, not to any merit of our own. That salvation is sure, of which he is the Author; and if he will work, none shall hinder.</body></html>
