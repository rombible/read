The prophet's growing despondency about his country's future is revealed in her name. The rest of the verse is best rendered--<span class= "ital">For I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel, that I should indeed forgive them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived again, and bare a daughter</span>. And God said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah. The first birth symbolized the blood-guiltiness and idolatry of Israel, and the consequent destruction. Two other births follow to confirm the certainty of the coming calamity, to develop it further, and exhibit the nation ever which it impended under new phases, as also to show the prospect of deliverance to be hopeless. The change of sex may indicate the totality of the nation, male and female, as Keil thinks; or rather the weak and defenseless condition of Israel after their bow was broken and their power crushed by the enemy. They are new ready to be led into captivity, like a female helpless and powerless and exposed to ell the insults of the conquerors. The birth of the daughter is thus explained by Kimchi: "After she had borne a so which is a proverbial reference to Jeroboam the son of Joash... she bore a daughter, who refers parabolically to Zechariah and to Shallum son of Jabesh, who reigned after him, who were weak as a female." The name given to the child is <span class="accented">Unpitied</span>, or Unfavored, if <span class="accented">ruchamah be</span> taken as a mutilated participle, the initial <span class="accented">mere</span> being dropped, though it is not found in close connection with a participle; or, <span class="accented">She-is-not-pitied</span>, if the word be a verb. In either case, the mercy which if exercised would save her from the miseries of captivity, is clean gone; and the love which, if it existed, would prompt that exercise of mercy, is no longer to be looked for. <span class="cmt_word">For I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away</span> (margin, <span class="accented">that I should altogether pardon them</span>). Aben Ezra quotes the correct meaning as follows: "Some say that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> is that I have up till now forgiven their iniquity; "and Kimchi: "Hitherto I have forgiven and pardoned them, because I have had mercy upon them; but I shall continue to do so no more." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">again</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>, to return or repeat. The construction of the first clause is peculiar. Rosenm&uuml;ller cites as parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a>; but more exact parallels are <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>, in both of which, and also in the text, Kimchi and Aben Ezra understand <span class="accented">asker</span> before the second verb. The last clause of the verse, however, presents a real difficulty, as we may infer from the variety of interpretations to which it has been subjected. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "But I will surely set myself in array against them." Jerome, confounding the verb with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span> translates, "But I will entirely forget them." Rashi: "I will <span class="accented">distribute to them a portion of their cup</span> and of their deeds," viz. as they have deserved by their deeds, Kimchi: "I will <span class="accented">raise up enemies against them</span>, who shall carry them into captivity and lay waste their land."Aben Ezra: "I will take them away;" he quotes for this meaning of the text <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>, and takes the prefix <span class="accented">le</span> as the Aramaic sign of the accusative, giving as a notable example of the same <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>, <span class="accented">haregu leabner</span> for <span class="accented">eth-abner</span>. The Syriac Version is similar. A more feasible rendering, if the meaning of "take away" be retained, is that of Hengstenberg and others, who translate it: "I will utterly take away from them, or with regard to them," viz. everything. We prefer the sense of "pardon," as given in the Chaldee; in the margin of the Authorized Version; by Ewald, Wunsche, and Delitzsch; and mentioned by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. Thus it will read: "I will no more favor them that I should verily forgive them." The flint verb literally means the pitiful yearning of parental love - the strong feeling of affection which the Greeks expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>. Paul's rendering of the word with the privative denotes absence of love; and Peter's the absence of mercy. Both notions are contained in the word, and their relation is well explained by Pussy, who says, It is <span class="accented">tender love</span> in him who pitieth; mercy as shown to him who needeth mercy." Now, the connection between such tenderness of love and forgiving mercy is natural and close. Many an instance of this had been experienced in the previous history of Israel; many a time God's compassion had been extended to his erring people, notwithstanding their manifold provocations; but that day is gone - the Divine long-suffering is exhausted. Once Israel is carried captive, there shall be no return; no mercy to restore them, as in the case of Judah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Israel was prosperous, yet then Hosea boldly tells them of their sins, and foretells their destruction. Men are not to be flattered in sinful ways because they prosper in the world; nor will it last long if they go on still in their trespasses. The prophet must show Israel their sin; show it to be exceedingly hateful. Their idolatry is the sin they are here charged with. Giving that glory to any creature which is due to God alone, is an injury and affront to God; such as for a wife to take a stranger, is to her husband. The Lord, doubtless, had good reasons for giving such a command to the prophet; it would form an affecting picture of the Lord's unmerited goodness and unwearied patience, and of the perverseness and ingratitude of Israel. We should be broken and wearied with half that perverseness from others, with which we try the patience and grieve the Spirit of our God. Let us also be ready to bear any cross the Lord appoints. The prophet must show the ruin of the people, in the names given to his children. He foretells the fall of the royal family in the name of his first child: call his name Jezreel, which signifies dispersion. He foretells God's abandoning the nation in the name of the second child; Lo-ruhamah, not beloved, or not having obtained mercy. God showed great mercy, but Israel abused his favours. Sin turns away the mercy of God, even from Israel, his own professing people. If pardoning mercy is denied, no other mercy can be expected. Though some, through unbelief, are broken off, yet God will have a church in this world till the end of time. Our salvation is owing to God's mercy, not to any merit of our own. That salvation is sure, of which he is the Author; and if he will work, none shall hinder.</body></html>
