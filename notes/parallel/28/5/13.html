(On "Jareb," see <span class= "ital">Excursus.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS A: ON JAREB (Hosea 5:13).</span><p>Schrader, in his "Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament," has the following note:--"King Combat, or Contention (Jareb), is not a proper name--none such being found in the Assyrian lists. In the prevailing uncertainty respecting Biblical chronology, it is hard to determine what Assyrian monarch is meant by this appellative. If we are to understand Salmanassar III. (781-772) as the king in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm" title="Therefore shall a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces on her children.">Hosea 10:14</a>, under the name Salman, the allusion here may be to <span class= "ital">Assur-dan-ilu</span> (771-754), who conducted a series of expeditions to the West." But when we turn to Schrader's comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm" title="Therefore shall a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces on her children.">Hosea 10:14</a>, we find that he abandons the theory that Salman is Salmanassar III. (see <span class= "ital">ad. Loc.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> On the other hand, Tiglath-pileser, whom Schrader and Sir H. Rawlinson identify with the Pul of Scripture, was a warrior of great prowess, to whom such a designation as "King Combat" from Hosea and his contemporaries would admirably apply. The verse might then be taken to refer to the events of the reign of Menahem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a>, see also <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> But this explanation, probable as it is, is complicated with questions of Biblical chronology. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to King Jareb</span>. Both kingdoms became conscious of their disease and decline; Ephraim felt its sickness or internal consumption, Judah its wound or external corruption (<span class="accented">mazor</span>, a festering wound, from <span class="accented">zur</span>, to squeeze out); they were both conscious of rottenness in their condition. That diseased condition was rather spiritual apostasy than political adversity, though these were connected as cause and effect. But, instead of applying to Jehovah, Ephraim had recourse to Assyria and its king for health and help, but in vain; for no earthly power could avert the Divine judgments. The punishment threatened in the twelfth verse prompts the efforts to obtain succor mentioned in this. The general sense of the verse is given by Kimchi as follows: "When Ephraim and Judah saw that the enemies were constantly invading and plundering them, they seek help from the King of Assyria; but turn not back to me, nor seek help from me, but from flesh and blood, which, however, cannot help them when it is not my pleasure." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some, as the Jewish interpreters, refer the first clause as a matter of course to Ephraim, but the second to Judah; thus, Jerome in like manner understands Ephraim's visit of that to Pul, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15</a>, and the message of Judah to Tiglath-pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a>.); but an interval of thirty years lay between the two events thus described as synchronous. Rashi explains the former clause of Hoshea's visit to Shalmaneser the King of Assyria, and the second of Ahaz's to Tiglath-pileser; Kimchi, again, refers the former to Menahem visiting Pul, and the second of Ahaz to Tiglath-pileser (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ephraim is the subject in both clauses, so that there is no need of a supposed reference to Judah in the second. Calvin correctly restricts them both to Ephraim, and accounts for the restriction as follows: "Why, then, does he name only Ephraim? Even because the beginning of this evil commenced in the kingdom of Israel; for they were the first who went to the King of Assur, that they might, by his help, resist their neighbors, the Syrians; the Jews afterwards followed their example. Since, then, the Israelites afforded a precedent to the Jews to send for aids of this kind, the prophet expressly confines his discourse to them." He admits, however, that the accusation had respect to both in common; or Ephraim may have applied on behalf of Judah as well as for herself. There is much diversity of opinion with regard to the word "Jareb." Some take it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for a proper name, either of an Assyrian king or of some place or city in the country of Assyria. as the LXX., Aben Ezra, and Kimchi; but the absence of the article is opposed to this, neither is <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>, "and Zechariah reigned as king" (<span class="accented">vayyimloch melech</span>), <span class="accented">a</span> proper parallel. Others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> more correctly explain as a qualifying epithet to "king," that is, "pleader," "striver," or "warrior," in ether words, a warlike or champion king, like the epithet of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> among the Greeks. The indefiniteness in this case gives the idea of majesty or might, as in Arabic; thus, "a champion king, and such a king!" <span class="cmt_word">Yet could he not</span> (<span class="accented">yet shall he not be able to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>heal you</span> (plural, and so Ephraim and Judah), <span class="cmt_word">nor cure you of your wound.</span> Whatever the distress was, whether arising from hostile invasion or domestic troubles, those degenerate kings had recourse to foreigners for aid. With the <span class="accented">profitlessness as</span> well as the sinfulness of such attempts they are here sharply rebuked. Thus Calvin: "<span class="accented">Here</span> God declares that whatever the Israelites might seek would be in vain. ' Ye think,' he <span class="accented">says</span>, ' that you can escape my hand by these remedies; but your folly will at length betray itself, for he will avail you nothing; that is, King Jareb will not heal you.'" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-15 The destruction of impenitent sinners is not mere talk, to frighten them, it is a sentence which will not be recalled. And it is a mercy that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from the wrath to come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart the commandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God are sometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as a worm; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgments of God consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe and thriving, but when they look into their state, shall find themselves wasting and decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent. Many a nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption. Gradually, God comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to prevent greater, if they will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judah found themselves in danger, they sought the protection of the Assyrians, but this only helped to make their wound the worse. They would be forced to apply to God. He will bring them home to himself, by afflictions. When men begin to complain more of their sins than of their afflictions, then there begins to be some hope of them; and when under the conviction of sin, and the corrections of the rod, we must seek the knowledge of God. Those who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.</body></html>
