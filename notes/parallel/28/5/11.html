Interpreters differ as to the rare word <span class= "ital">tsav,</span> translated "commandment." It only occurs in one other place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm" title="For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:">Isaiah 28:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm" title="But the word of the LORD was to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.">Isaiah 28:13</a>). Ewald regards it as meaning "wooden post," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> their idol, but this has no basis in Old Testament usage, though etymologically ingenious. The majority of Jewish and modern commentators take it as meaning the evil ordinance of Jeroboam, who demanded the reverence of his subjects for the calf-symbol of Jehovah. The LXX. had another text (<span class= "ital">shav</span> instead of <span class= "ital">tsav</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> which they render "vanities," and are followed by the Targum and Syriac version. This is worthy of attention.<p><span class= "bld">Willingly</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "waywardly."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment</span>. The expression <span class="accented">retsuts mishpat</span> is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some explained, "crushed by the judgment," that is, of God, according to which <span class="accented">mishpat</span> would be the genitive of the agent as <span class="accented">mukkeh Elohim</span>. But "crushed of judgment" or in judgment is justly preferred by others, the genitive taking the place of the accusative. Again, though the combination of '<span class="accented">ashuq</span> with <span class="accented">rutsuts</span> is frequent, occurring as early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, the latter is the stronger term. The oppression is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> not that which their own kings and princes practiced upon their subjects, according to Aben Ezra, "Their kings oppressed and cheated them;" nor the injustice practiced by the people of Ephraim among themselves, as implied by the LXX., "Ephraim altogether prevailed against his adversary, he trod judgment underfoot." The reference <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is rather to Ephraim being oppressed and crushed in judgment by the heathen nations around; thus Rashi explains, "Oppressed is Ephraim ever by the hand of the heathen - chastised with chastisements;" so also Kimchi, "By the hand of the heathen who oppressed and crushed them through hard judgments." The construction is asyndetous, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>, "The rain is over, is gone." <span class="cmt_word">Because he willingly walked after the commandment.</span> This clause assigns the reason of Ephraim's oppression. They evinced ready willing-hood in following <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the commandments of men instead of the commandments of God. <span class="accented">Tsav</span> is thus understood by Aben Ezra, and in like manner Ewald explains it to mean an arbitrary or self-imposed precept. The LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, vanity, translating, "for he began to go after vanities (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" which the Chaldee and Syriac fellow. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is rather the commandment of Jeroboam about the worship of the calves which lay at the root of the nation's sin. It is welt explained by Kimchi: "Although the word 'Jeroboam' is wanting, so that he makes no mention of it after <span class="accented">tsar</span>, such is the scriptural usage in certain places, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to omit a word where the sense is plain. For it was a well-known fact that in that generation they walked not after the commandment, but after that of Jeroboam; therefore he has abbreviated the word to indicate the worthlessness, and used <span class="accented">tsav</span> instead of <span class="accented">mitsvah</span>." Perhaps it may have the concrete sense of the object of idolatrous worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-15 The destruction of impenitent sinners is not mere talk, to frighten them, it is a sentence which will not be recalled. And it is a mercy that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from the wrath to come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart the commandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God are sometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as a worm; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgments of God consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe and thriving, but when they look into their state, shall find themselves wasting and decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent. Many a nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption. Gradually, God comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to prevent greater, if they will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judah found themselves in danger, they sought the protection of the Assyrians, but this only helped to make their wound the worse. They would be forced to apply to God. He will bring them home to himself, by afflictions. When men begin to complain more of their sins than of their afflictions, then there begins to be some hope of them; and when under the conviction of sin, and the corrections of the rod, we must seek the knowledge of God. Those who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.</body></html>
