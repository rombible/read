Clear reference to the Mosaic institute. Ye shall go back to Egypt, says the prophet, and there learn again the bitter lessons of the past--either the positive return to Egypt or the disastrous hankering after Egyptian alliances.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the sacrifice of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but the Lord accepteth them not.</span> The mention of altars naturally suggests that of sacrifices, and, as a matter of fact, with the multiplication of those altars riley multiplied their sacrifices, so that the latter kept pace with the former, and a due proportionateness maintained between them. And yet, numerous as those sacrifices were, they were not real sacrifices; they were no more and no better than slaying so many animals and feasting on their flesh; the spirit of devotion was absent, therefore God did not accept them. <span class="cmt_word">Now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</span> The turning-point was now reached, their iniquity was full, and the time of punishment had arrived. God had delivered their fathers out of the bondage of Egypt; now he will send their posterity into a bondage similar to or even worse than that of Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples</span> (or, <span class="accented">palaces</span>). Here Israel's sin, with the consequent suffering, is traced to its source. The origin of all was their forgetfulness of God and false confidence in man - them-selves and others or both. <span class="cmt_word">And Judah hath multiplied fenced cities.</span> Israel forgot his Maker, and built shrines on high places, "consecrating," as Jerome says, "whole hills and mountains and shady trees to Baal and Ashtaroth and other idols." Judah also, though aware that Israel had renounced the love of Jehovah and had been punished for their sins, did not return to God, but trusted in fenced cities. <span class="cmt_word">But I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof</span>. To the word for "city" the masculine suffix is attached; while with "palaces" the feminine suffix is employed. With the proper names of peoples either gender is used: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the masculine with reference to the people or population, and the feminine in relation to the country; or the reference may be to Israel and Judah, the masculine referring to their respective peoples, and feminine to their lands; though <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Aben Ezra refers the feminine suffix of "palaces" to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, city, which is feminine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, foundations, instead of palaces <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:11-14 It is a great sin to corrupt the worship of God, and will be charged as sin on all who do it, how plausible soever their excuses may seem to be. The Lord had caused his law to be written for them, but they cared not to know, and would not obey it. Man seems by the temples he builds to be mindful of his Maker, yet really he has forgotten him, because he has cast off all his fear; but none ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. So long as men despise the truths and precepts of God's word, and the ordinances of his worship, all the observances and offerings, however costly, of their own devising, will be unto them for sin; for those services only are acceptable to God, which are done according to his word, and through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
