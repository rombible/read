The meaning of (b) is plain, the import being that the idol-worship had led to the rejection and so the withdrawal of Jehovah; while the sense of (a) conveys the idea that the golden calf which the country represented by its capital and the government had established at Bethel as the symbol of their worship, so far from protecting its worshippers, would fall itself into the hands of the Assyrian invader. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to "Cast off [as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>] thy calf, O Samaria;" which is an exhortation to Samaria, and not only Samaria, but the entire country, with the inhabitants of the capital at its head, to cast aside the calf-worship by which they had incurred the wrath of the Almighty. Jerome, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5bb;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (Pual), renders, "Cast off is thy calf." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Some modern scholars translate, "He has cast off thy calf," and refer it to the enemy, and rather in the sense of carrying off the golden image as a spoil; or to Jehovah; thus De Wette has, "[Jehova] verwirft deiu Calb, Samarien," which is not in keeping with the first person in the next clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Others take the verb intransitively, and give it the meaning of "smelling bodily," "emitting intolerable stench." "being loathsome or disgusting;" thus Keil has, "Thy calf disgusts, O Samaria." So Wunsche: "Anekolt deiu Calb." Israel loathed or felt disgust at pure worship and what was really good; now Jehovah in turn is disgusted with their golden calf and hateful idolatry. No wonder it is added, <span class="accented">Mine anger is waxed hot</span> (has burnt or blazed out) <span class="accented">against them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the calf and Samaria, nor the calves, but their stupid, sinful worshippers. <span class="cmt_word">How long will it be ere they attain to innocence?</span> Or it may be translated, <span class="accented">How long will it be ere they shall be able to endure</span> (bear) <span class="accented">innocence</span> (guiltlessness)? The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span>, has frequently to be supplemented by another verb, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, "A proud heart will not I suffer;" so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>. The speaker here turns, as it were, from unwilling auditors to others more ready to lend ancar, and asks, "How long are they incapable of purity of life instead of the abominations of idolatry? How great the madness that, while I allow space and place for repentance, they are unwilling to return to soundness of mind! " The Authorized Version rendering is supported by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. The former explains: "It is as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> were written double, ' Thee as thy calf cast off - thee Samaria, as if it has rejected thee, for the city shall be laid and its inhabitants shall go into captivity;'" and Kimchi says, "<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> is transitive, and has the meaning of ' remove,' as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>. He says, 'O Samaria, thy calf has removed thee,' that is, on account of it thou art removed out of thy land." The last clause is also well explained by Kimchi, though in a different sense from that given above, thus: "How long are they unable to purify themselves from this guilt (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. idolatry)?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-10 They promised themselves plenty, peace, and victory, by worshipping idols, but their expectations came to nothing. What they sow has no stalk, no blade, or, if it have, the bud shall yield no fruit, there was nothing in them. The works of darkness are unfruitful; nay, the end of those things is death. The hopes of sinners will deceive them, and their gains will be snares. In times of danger, especially in the day of judgment, all carnal devices will fail. They take a course by themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they will be the easier and surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's colt, than in seeking for that succour and that satisfaction in the creature, which are to be had in God only. Though men may sorrow a little, yet if it is not after a godly sort, they will be brought to sorrow everlastingly.</body></html>
