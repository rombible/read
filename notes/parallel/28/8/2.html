Thus the Chaldee paraphrase has: "As often as calamity comes upon them they pray and say before me, Now we acknowledge that we have no God beside thee; deliver us, because we are thy people Israel." As to the construction, either "Israel" is in apposition to <span class="accented">anachnu</span>, the subject of the verb, or there is a transposition. Thus Rashi: "We must transpose the words, and explain, ' To me, cries Israel, My God, we know thee; '" so also Kimchi and Aben Ezra. The former says, "' Israel ' which comes after, should be before, after <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, and many inversions of this kind occur in Scripture, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>." The word "Israel" is omitted by the LXX. and Syriac, and in many manuscripts of Kennicott and De Rossi. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 When Israel was hard pressed, they would claim protection from God, but this would be disregarded. What stead will it stand in to say, My God, I know thee, if we cannot say, My God, I love thee, serve thee, and cleave to thee only?</body></html>
