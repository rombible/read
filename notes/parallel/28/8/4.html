Their conduct was not guided by Divine direction, nor in obedience to the Divine will, nor with the Divine sanction. This state of things began with Israel's revolt from the house of David, and rebellion against the son of Solomon their legitimate sovereign, and was repeated in subsequent usurpations. Perhaps we may go further back, even to the appointment of the first king of the yet undivided kingdom, when "the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." Usurpations such as those of Zimri, Omri, and Shallum at least are comprehended in the appointments referred to - appointments on making which the people did not inquire of the Lord, nor act under his guidance, nor seek his sanction. Some go so far as to include all the kings of Israel that succeeded Jeroboam. Thus Cyril says, "He denies the kingdom of Israel and his successors on the throne of Israel." Aben Ezra also extends the statement to the kings of the northern kingdom from the days of Jeroboam: "They inquired not of God with respect to the making of Jeroboam king, although it is written, ' Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose.'" A seeming contradiction here exists between the statement of the prophet here and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-37.htm">1 Kings 11:37</a>, where God promises by the Prophet Ahijah, "I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel," and the fact of Jehu's anointing being ordered by the Prophet Elisha, who sent one of the children of the prophets for that purpose with the words, "Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel." The plotting of Jeroboam, and the conspiracy of Jehu against Joram, and the conspiracies of other usurpers, were things which God could not approve; and so we must distinguish between the permission and approval of Jehovah; in his government he permits many things which from his nature we know he does not and cannot approve. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> is usually and properly rendered, "they have made princes;" but Aben Ezra and Rashi translate it as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> equivalent to "they have removed;" while the Massora reckon <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> in the number of those words which are written with <span class="accented">shin</span> but are read and explained with <span class="accented">samech</span>. Some manuscripts also of Kennicett and De Rossi have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>. Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they (literally, <span class="accented">it</span>) may be cut off. This is a second proof of Israel's renunciation of Jehovah. They used their gold in making the idolatrous calves, and their silver in supporting their idolatrous worship; or they made the idol-calves, some of silver, and others of gold. The consequence rather than the purpose is the destruction of it, namely, the gold and silver; or the ruin of the kingdom or of each member of it; or the cutting off of their name, according to Kimchi. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in Greek, is generally relic, denoting "purpose;" nor is it <span class="accented">ecbatic</span> here, denoting "result," though, according to the Hebrew mode of thought, design and consequence often coincide. Its meaning here is well explained by Keil, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> describes the consequence of this conduct, which, though not designed, was nevertheless inevitable, as if it had been distinctly intended." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 When Israel was hard pressed, they would claim protection from God, but this would be disregarded. What stead will it stand in to say, My God, I know thee, if we cannot say, My God, I love thee, serve thee, and cleave to thee only?</body></html>
