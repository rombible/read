Much depends on the reference of the word "them." We prefer to regard it as referring to Ephraim rather than to the nations (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Assyria and Egypt). Render, <span class= "ital">I will gather them</span> (<span class= "ital">Israel</span>)<span class= "ital"> together, so that in a short time they may delay</span> (this translation approved by Ewald, Wnsche, and Simson) <span class= "ital">to render the tribute burden due to the king of princes</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Assyrian monarch). "Gather them together," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in restraint, so that they cannot roam so wildly, seeking help (Ewald). This accords with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-8.htm" title="For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.">Hosea 2:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>. Such non-payment of tribute actually occurred a few years later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2Kings 17:4</a>). Others render it: I will gather these nations (of the East) round about her to look scornfully on her ruin, and they shall sorrow a little (used ironically) at the imposition of the king of the princes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them.</span> Instead of "have hired," "sue" would make the sense more obvious. But who are they of whom it is here said, "I will gather them"? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The nations, among whom Ephraim has been suing for endearments from paramours, shall be gathered together to effect the hurt or ruin of Ephraim; while for this explanation <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-37.htm">Ezekiel 16:37</a>, is cited as parallel: "Behold, therefore, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> others maintain that the persons gathered are the Ephraimites whom the Lord will gather, that is to say, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> will bring them all together among the nations, leading them thither; and to this exposition <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a> is thought to furnish a parallel, at least as far as the meaning of the verb "<span class="accented">to</span> gather" is concerned: "<span class="accented">Egypt</span> shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Or the Ephraimites shall be gathered together to be led away in chains and dispersed among the nations; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> or shall be gathered for death and to perish by sword and famine; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> to be gathered together unto Samaria and other fortified cities, in order to be taken to. gather and carried by their enemies away into captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Rashi understands the gathering together of Israel, but in the sense of a promise . "Though they have sued for endearments among the nations, I will gather them out of the nations among which they have been dispersed, as the same verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5e6;</span>, is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54.htm">Isaiah 54</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>, <span class="accented">viz</span>. 'I will not delay their deliverance."' This exposition is not in harmony with the context, from which we expect a threat of punishment rather than a promise of reward. Both Kimchi and Aben Ezra favor exposition <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "What benefit is it to them, asks the prophet, that they sue among the nations? For soon I will gather the nations against them to carry them into captivity." Thus Kimchi and somewhat similarly Aben Ezra. Whether we take the verb as pointed with daghesh in the <span class="accented">tav</span>, and so from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5df;</span>, to give, that is, gifts to lovers, or without daghesh, and from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;</span>, to hire or bargain, makes little difference in the general sense of the clause. And they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. This fixes with more definiteness the meaning of the foregoing member of the verse. According to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (Qeri) Hiph. from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>, "a little" would require to be taken Ironically; it is better, therefore, to render it "in a little time." The burden is not that of taxation or even deportation, but of oppression in exile. The oppressor is the monarch of Assyria, who <span class="accented">asks</span> boastingly. "Are not my princes altogether kings?" Another <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> translation is, "They will begin to diminish on account of the burden of the king of princes.' According to this the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> is future of Hiph. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, to begin, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> is either an infinitive for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5d8;</span>, or rather a verbal adjective: and the sense is that they begin to be or become fewer in consequence of the <span class="accented">Assyrian's</span> oppression. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> taking the verb from the same root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span> cognate with Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, loose, set free, Gesenius translates, "<span class="accented">And</span> they (the hostile nations) shall presently force them from the burden (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the unpleasant dominion)of the king." The Septuagint <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>, and a copula between, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>." and princes;" and render, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">And</span> they shall cease a little to anoint a king and princes." Our choice must lie between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in interpreting this difficult clause; there is a modification of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> worth mentioning; it is: "They shall in a little while sorrow for the burden which they pay (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the tribute which they pay) kings and princes," viz. all of them, the two concluding words being thus in apposition to the subject of the verb. On the whole, we prefer there rendering of the clause in the Authorized Version, as both grammatical and supplying a sense consistent with the context. The prophet foretells that Israel would ere long feel painfully the sorrowful consequences of their going to Assyria and suing there for help. Oppressed by a yearly tribute to the Assyrian king, they would smart under the yoke, and long to be free. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-10 They promised themselves plenty, peace, and victory, by worshipping idols, but their expectations came to nothing. What they sow has no stalk, no blade, or, if it have, the bud shall yield no fruit, there was nothing in them. The works of darkness are unfruitful; nay, the end of those things is death. The hopes of sinners will deceive them, and their gains will be snares. In times of danger, especially in the day of judgment, all carnal devices will fail. They take a course by themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they will be the easier and surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's colt, than in seeking for that succour and that satisfaction in the creature, which are to be had in God only. Though men may sorrow a little, yet if it is not after a godly sort, they will be brought to sorrow everlastingly.</body></html>
