The prophet here vindicates the justness of Jehovah's complaint and the folly of Israel's conduct. The first clause points out the orion of this idolatry - this god of gold was out of Israel, it proceeded from them and was invented by their kings. The second clause shows that it was of human manufacture; while the natural inference follows in the third clause to the effect that, having its origin with man and being made by man, it could not be God. Or if the rendering, "Thy calf disgusts," be adopted, the <span class="accented">ki</span> introduces the explanation of the disgust which that abomination caused. This idol was of home manufacture, not imported from abroad, as Baal and Ashtaroth from the Sidoniaus, Chemosh from the Moabites, and Moloch from the Ammonites. The Israelites themselves and their king Jeroboam made for the northern kingdom what had been learnt in Egypt. Thus Israel's god was a creature of Israel's own devising. How stupid and how absurd! Israel's god man-made, how enormous and abominable the iniquity! <span class="cmt_word">But the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span> It shall become splinters; the <span class="accented">hapaz legomenon</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is derived from an Arabic root, <span class="accented">shaba</span>, to cut; and thus, as the calf at Sinai was burnt and pulverized, the calf of Samaria shall be broken into splinters and destroyed. The whole verse is well explained by Kimchi: "Now ye will see if the calf is able to deliver its worshippers; it cannot even deliver itself, for it shall become splinters, as if he said that the enemies shall break it up and carry it away for the worth of the gold, not for any utility that is in it while it is still in the form of a calf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (broken pieces, shivers), fragments." The Septuagintal rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, is probably due to the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>, "turning away." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-10 They promised themselves plenty, peace, and victory, by worshipping idols, but their expectations came to nothing. What they sow has no stalk, no blade, or, if it have, the bud shall yield no fruit, there was nothing in them. The works of darkness are unfruitful; nay, the end of those things is death. The hopes of sinners will deceive them, and their gains will be snares. In times of danger, especially in the day of judgment, all carnal devices will fail. They take a course by themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they will be the easier and surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's colt, than in seeking for that succour and that satisfaction in the creature, which are to be had in God only. Though men may sorrow a little, yet if it is not after a godly sort, they will be brought to sorrow everlastingly.</body></html>
