The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> trumpet is at once to be employed for the purpose. The rendering of both the Targum and Syriac <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> expresses the same idea, though under a different form; the former has, "Cry with thy throat, as if it were a trumpet;" and the latter, "Let thy mouth be as a trumpet." According to this view, the Prophet Hoses expresses here very briefly what Isaiah has done more fully in the words, "Cry aloud [Hebrew, 'with the throat'] spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. here deviates considerably from the Maseoretic Hebrew text, translating <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span>, of the meaning of which Jerome acknowledges his ignorance, though he attempts to explain it. Cyril connects the words with the concluding part of the preceding chapter, thus: "This their setting at naught (of me) in the land of Egypt shall come into their own bosom. As the land, as the eagle against the house of the Lord;" while his explanation is as follows: "Since, though I preserved them and instructed them, and gave them victory over their enemies (for I strengthened them), they have impiously set me at naught, worshipping demons for gods, and have trusted to the land of the Egyptians, and have fancied that their help shall be sufficient for their prosperity, therefore their attempt shall return unto their own besom, and they shall find no good reward of their temerity; but they shall receive, as it were, into their bosom the deserved punishment. For he shall come, he shall come who shall lay them waste - the King of Assyria, with an innumerable multitude of warriors, and he shall come to them as the whole land and region and country, that one might think that the whole region of the Persians and Medes had wholly migrated and had come into Samaria. This is the meaning of the whole land (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span>). He shall likewise come as an eagle into the house of the Lord." (He shall come) <span class="cmt_word">as an eagle against the house of the Lord.</span> These words cannot mean, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as Hitzig thinks, the rapidity with which the prophet is directed to convey his tidings of alarm, as if it were, "Fly [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> imperfect being supplied], thou prophet, as an eagle;" nor yet, with others, the loudness of the alarm he was to sound. The meaning abruptly though vividly expressed refers <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the approaching invasion of the enemy, though there is no need to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, It is the substance of the prophet's alarm. As an eagle the enemy (as is evident flora ver. 3) shall come against the house of the Lord. The enemy was, in all probability, the Assyrian, in whose symbolism the eagle bulks largely; while the griffin vulture, scenting from afar, and coming down with rapid and terrific swoop upon its prey, is an appropriate image of the sudden and impetuous character of his invasion. The house of the Lord is neither the temple at Jerusalem, for the prophecy relates to the northern kingdom; nor the temple at Samaria, which could not be called <span class="accented">Beta Yehovah</span>, but <span class="accented">Bethbamoth</span>; nor the land of Israel, which could not with any propriety be called a house; but the people of Israel, which, owing to God's covenant relation to that people, is called his house, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house." The figure seems an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, "The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth;" while it has a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>, "For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together." <span class="cmt_word">Because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my Law.</span> These words exhibit the cause of Israel's being exposed to the sudden hostile attack which the prophet was commissioned to proclaim. The provocations of Israel consisted in violating the covenant which God had been pleased to make with them, and in proving unfaithful to that Law, obedience to which was the condition of the covenant. The explanation of the whole verse thus given is confirmed by the Hebrew commentators; thus Rashi says, "The Shechinah (or Divine Majesty)says to the prophet, 'Let the voice of thy palate be heard and sound the trumpet and say, The enemies fly hither as the eagle flieth and come unto the house of the Lord.'" Abeu Ezra more concisely conveys the same sense: "It is the words of Jehovah to the prophet, ' Set the cornet to thy palate, for the enemy flieth as the eagle against the house of the Lord.'" Kimchi differs in two respects from his brethren, understanding the address to be not that of Jehovah to the prophet, but of the prophet to the people; and the house of the Lord to include the whole laud of Israel and temple at Jerusalem: "The cornet to thy palate, as he said above, 'Sound the trumpet in Gibeah.' Many a time the prophet speaks to the people in the singular and many a time in the plural. He says, 'Put the trumpet to thy mouth, for behold! the enemy flies hither like the eagle over the house of Jehovah; 'he means to say,' Over the whole land and also over the house of Jehovah, in order to destroy it.' And he joins the trumpet to the palate (and yet man sets the trumpet to the mouth) because the voice passes over the way of the palate after it comes out of the throat." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 When Israel was hard pressed, they would claim protection from God, but this would be disregarded. What stead will it stand in to say, My God, I know thee, if we cannot say, My God, I love thee, serve thee, and cleave to thee only?</body></html>
