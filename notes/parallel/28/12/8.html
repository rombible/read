Such a coarse pursuit of wealth, and such glorying in the innocence of the entire process by which it has been obtained, has its parallel in the moral position of the Laodicean Church, rebuked by our Lord (Revelation 3).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance.</span> Ephraim in this verse boasts of his riches, though procured by fraud and violence, while he maintains at the same time that he has not sinned thereby so as to expose himself to punishment or deserve severe reprehension. The particle - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>- has two principal meanings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "surely" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "only." In the former sense the clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> may allude to the injunction contained in ver. 6 to wait on God, and may signify, "No doubt I have become rich, yet not through Divine help, but by my own exertions;" in the latter sense it may signify, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "I have only become rich; I have done nothing else; I have done nothing amiss" Aben Ezra regards <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> as introducing the apodosis, and explains it nearly in the sense of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (1)</span>, thus: "The sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;</span> is, 'God has not given me the wealth, <span class="accented">but</span> I by myself [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my own unaided efforts] have become rich, for I am not as the Canaanite,' that is, the merchant, as 'There shall be no more the Canaanite' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>) ;" he then proceeds to show the connection, "And the meaning [according to the context] is, 'Why does he say, Keep mercy and judgment, and be not an oppressor like the Canaanite [nor am I]? yet all is my own honest earning; none of the sons of men shall find that I have sinned.'" The interpretation of Kimchi is similar, but somewhat simpler, thus: "The words, 'I am become rich,' are the opposite of 'Wait on thy God continually.' But he (Ephraim) does not wait on God the blessed, and he does not acknowledge that he gave him strength to acquire wealth, but says, 'My own power and the strength of my hands have made for me this wealth,' and he forgetteth God the blessed, who gave him power to work, as it is written in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>), 'And thou forget the Lord thy God.' This is what he (the prophet) means by 'I have become rich;' he means to say, 'I have become rich from myself,'" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by my own labor. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> denotes both physical or bodily strength, and also, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, riches, Latin <span class="accented">opes, prob</span>ably as procured thereby. The flourishing state of the kingdom during the reigns of Joash and Jeroboam II. may have induced their overweening self-confidence and their amazing forgetfulness of God, and at the same time this surprising ignorance of their real condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f55;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I have found refreshment for myself," and Jerome, "Inveni mihi idolum," as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;</span> had been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In all my labors they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin</span>; margin, <span class="accented">all my labors suffice me not:</span> he shall bare <span class="accented">punishment of iniquity in whom is sin</span>. Here two modes of construction are possible and each has had its advocates; thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the <span class="accented">subject</span> of the verb, as in the LXX., which is, "None of his labors shall be found available for him on account of the sins he has committed." This is the rendering followed and interpreted by Cyril and Theodoret. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The words in question, instead of being taken as the subject to the verb, may be employed <span class="accented">absolutely</span> or with the ellipsis of a preposition, as in the Authorized Version; thus: "As to my labors, or the fruits of my labors," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>, is used in both senses. The meaning of the passage then is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, besides the sins of fraud and oppression, Ephraim did not shrink through shame to vindicate his conduct and to maintain that. in all the riches he had acquired with such labor, no one could show that those riches had been unjustly acquired by him, or that there was sin contracted in their acquisition. Thus Kimchi: "He (the prophet) mentions another vice, saying that he (Ephraim) oppresses, and asserts that, in all he has labored for and gathered together, they shall not be able to find <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> any riches of iniquity and sin. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> is the same as iniquity <span class="accented">and</span> sin, and thus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>) 'it is good and comely' (<span class="accented">asher</span> here also for <span class="accented">ray</span>). Or the explanation of it is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> They shall not find with me iniquity. nor any matter in which there is sin pertaining to me. And <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is less than <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;</span> iniquity, for sin comes sometimes by reason of error. Or the explanation of 'iniquity which were sin' is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Iniquity in which there was sin to me; as if he said, with regard to which I had sinned; for if riches came into my hand through iniquity and robbery, it was not with my knowledge; he means: so that I sinned in relation to it, and took it by iniquity with my knowledge; and in this way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-16.htm">Leviticus 22:16</a>) 'they lade themselves with the iniquity of trespass; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;</span> being in construct state, that is to say, iniquity with regard to which they trespassed." <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> signifies "belonging to me;" while <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d0;</span> is read, not as a noun, but as a verb in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Chaldee, which is explained by Rashi, gives an explanation identical, though only partially so, with the marginal rendering of the Authorized Version, namely, "It were good for thee if thou consideredst with thyself: all my riches do not suffice me, in order to expiate the iniquity which I have committed." This, and the marginal reading - both where they coincide and where they diverge - we must unhesitatingly reject as far-fetched, artificial, and having no real basis in the text. To their other sins Israel added this protestation of innocence, which was the solemn protestation of a falsehood. The clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> may admit another sense; thus: If in ray gains by labor iniquity should be found, that indeed would be sin; but such is not the case. Thus, like the Pharisees of a later age, did they justify themselves before men; but God knew their hollow-hearted hypocrisy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-14 Ephraim became a merchant: the word also signifies a Canaanite. They carried on trade upon Canaanitish principles, covetously and with fraud and deceit. Thus they became rich, and falsely supposed that Providence favoured them. But shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. Let them remember, not only what a mighty prince Jacob was with God, but what a servant he was to Laban. The benefits we have had from the word of God, make our sin and folly the worse, if we put any slight upon that word. We had better follow the hardest labour in poverty, than grow rich by sin. We may form a judgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with that of ancient believers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises the message of God, will perish. May we all hear his word with humble, obedient faith.</body></html>
