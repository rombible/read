He (Jehovah) says, 'What could I do to you and I did not do it, so that ye should not forget me? And what did I do with your fathers? I spoke constantly with the prophets to admonish you from me, and I multiplied visions to you many days.'" The Authorized Version <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> employs "by" as the equivalent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> here. The pronoun <span class="accented">v'anoki</span> is emphatic, viz. "I even I," as though he said, "I and not another;" while the preterit proves Jehovah to have continued his visions to the very moment at which the prophet speaks. To the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> use similitudes, some supply a verbal noun of corporate sense, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This, however, is unnecessary, as a verb often includes its cognate noun, of which we have several similar ellipses, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, "They bare <span class="accented">children</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> understood] to them;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, "They shall set themselves in array [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> understood] against her." The LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> has <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was represented; "and Jerome renders it <span class="accented">assimilatus sum</span>. The three modes of Divine communication here referred to are prediction, vision, and similitude. The word for <span class="accented">vision</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, is used here as a collective; it differs from the dream in being higher degree of Divine revelation, also the senses of the receiver are awake and active, while in the dream they are inoperative and passive. Of the <span class="accented">similitude</span>, again, we have examples in Isaiah's parable of a vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>.), and in Ezekiel's similitude of a wretched infant, to represent the natural state of Jerusalem. Aben Ezra remarks, I have established emblems and comparisons that ye might understand me;" and Kimchi, "I have given emblems and parables by means of the prophets, as Isaiah says, 'My well-beloved hath a vineyard;' and Ezekiel, 'Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan.' And the explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> is that by their hand he sends them emblems and similitudes as (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>) 'which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses'" Thus God, as Rosenm&uuml;ller observes, "left no means of admonishing them untried." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 11</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity.</span> In reference to hypotheticals, Driver remarks, "With an <span class="accented">imperfect</span> in protasis.

The first part of this clause has been variously rendered. Some take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> affirmatively, in the sense <span class="accented">of certainly, assuredly</span>; others translate it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> interrogatively, as in the Authorized Version, though even thus it would be more accurately rendered: <span class="accented">Is Gilead iniquity of</span> Pusey, following the common version, explains it as follows: 'The prophet asks the question in order to answer it more peremptorily. He raises the doubt in order to crush it the more impressively.' Is there iniquity in Gilead? 'Alas I there was nothing else. <span class="accented">Surely they are vanity</span>; or, strictly, <span class="accented">they have become merely vanity</span>." There does not appear, however, sufficient reason for departing from the ordinary meaning of the word, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> namely, <span class="accented">if</span> thus, <span class="accented">If Gilead i, iniquity</span> (worthlessness), <span class="accented">surely they have become vanity</span>. The clause thus rendered may denote one of two things - either - (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) moral worthlessness followed by physical nothingness, that is, moral decay followed by physical - sin succeeded by suffering; or (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) progress in moral corruption. To the former exposition corresponds the comment of Kimchi, as follows: "'If Gilead began to work vanity (nothingness),' for they began to do wickedness first, and they have been first carried into captivity. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> can connect itself with what precedes, so that its meaning is about Gilead which he has mentioned, and the sense would be repeated in different words. Or its sense shall be in connection with Gilgal. And although zakeph is on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, all the accents of the inter. prefers do not follow after the accents of the points." Similarly Rashi: "If disaster and oppression come upon them (the Gileadites) they have caused it to themselves, for certainly they are worthlessness, and sacrifies bullocks to idols in Gilgal. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> is a prophetic perfect implying the certainty of the prediction, as though already an accomplished fact." The exposition of Aben Ezra favors (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>); thus: "If the Gileadites, before I sent prophets to them, were worthlessness, surely they have become vanity, that is, instead of being morally better, they have become worse." To this exposition we find a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>, "They have walked after vanity, and are become vain." <span class="cmt_word">They sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>. The inhabitanta of Gilgal on the west were no better than the Gileadites on the east of Jordan; the whole kingdom, in fact, was overrun with idolatry. The sin of the people of Gilgal did not consist in the animals offered, but in the unlawfulness of the place of sacrifice. The punishment of both Gilgal and Gilead is denounced in the following part of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</span> Gilead signified" heap of witnesses," and Gilgal "heaping heap. The latter was mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a> and Hosea 9:15 as a notable center of idol-worship ("all their wickedness is in Gilgal") and retained, as we learn from the present passage, its notoriety for unlawful sacrifices, sacrifices customarily and continually offered (viz. iterative sense of Piel); the former was signalized in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-8.htm">Hosea 6:8</a> as "a city of them that work iniquity," and "polluted with blood." The altars in both places are to be turned into stone-heaps; this is expressed by a play on words so frequent in Hebrew; at Gilead as well as Gilgal they are to become <span class="accented">gallim</span>, or heaps of stones, such as husbandmen gather off ploughed and leave in useless heaps for the greater convenience of removal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (related to toll, a hill, that which is thrown up) is a furrow as formed by casting up or tearing into. The ruinous heaps of the altars implied, not only their destruction, but the desolation of the country. The altars would become dilapidated heaps, and the country depopulated. The Hebrew interpreters, however, connect with the heap-like altars the idea of number and conspicuousness: this they make prominent as indicating the gross idolatry of the people. Thus Rabbi: "Their altars are numerous as heaps in the furrows of the field. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;</span> is the furrow of the plougher, called <span class="accented">telem</span>;" Aben Ezra: "<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> is by way of figure, because they were numerous and conspicuous." Pococke combines with the idea of number that of ruinous heaps - "rude heaps of stones, in his sight; and such they should become, no one stone being left in order upon another." Kimchi's comment on the verse is the following: "The children of Gilgal were neighbors to the land of Gilead, only the Jordan was between them; they learnt also their ways (doings), and began to serve idols like them, and to practice iniquity and vanity, and sacrificed oxen to strange gods in the place where they had raised an altar to Jehovah the blessed, and where they had set up the tabernacle at the first after they had passed over Jordan: there also they sacrificed oxen to their idols. Not enough that they made an altar in Gilgal to idols, but they also built outside the city altars many and conspicuous, like heaps of stones on the furrows of the field." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-14 Ephraim became a merchant: the word also signifies a Canaanite. They carried on trade upon Canaanitish principles, covetously and with fraud and deceit. Thus they became rich, and falsely supposed that Providence favoured them. But shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. Let them remember, not only what a mighty prince Jacob was with God, but what a servant he was to Laban. The benefits we have had from the word of God, make our sin and folly the worse, if we put any slight upon that word. We had better follow the hardest labour in poverty, than grow rich by sin. We may form a judgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with that of ancient believers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises the message of God, will perish. May we all hear his word with humble, obedient faith.</body></html>
