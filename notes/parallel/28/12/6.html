The evidence of their repentance is twofold: one aspect is manward, consisting of mercy and judgment; the other is Godward, being a constant waiting upon God. The literal rendering brings out the meaning more clearly; it is, "And thou, in [or, 'by'] thy God thou shalt return." If we render the preposition by "in," we may understand it to imply entire dependence on God, or close and cordial fellowship with God; if we take it to mean "by," it signifies the power or help of God; while the return is moral and spiritual, with perhaps material and literal restoration implied A parallel for b<span class="accented">e</span> in the signification of "by" occurs in the first chapter of this book at the seventh verse: "I will save them by (<span class="accented">be</span>) the Lord their God;" also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>, "O people saved by (<span class="accented">be</span>) the Lord." We prefer the former sense as more simple and suitable; it is concisely and correctly explained by Keil as follows: "'<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> is a pregnant expression, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, 'So turn as to enter into vital fellowship with God; ' that is, to be truly converted.... The next two clauses are to be taken as explanatory of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>. The conversion is to show itself i, the perception of love and right towards their brethren, and in constant trust in God." The difference between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> is that the latter signifies "to return <span class="accented">to</span>," and the former "to return into," and thus expresses inward union with him. The general sense of the clause is thus expressed by Aben Ezra: "If thou wouldst return to God, he would be thy help to bring thee back to him;" and by Kimchi as follows: "But thou who art the seed of Jacob, if thou art willing, canst return unto thy God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou canst rest in him, as 'In returning and rest shall ye be saved' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>)." The second point of the verse has an instructive parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" In regard to the waiting upon God, of which the last clause speaks, Aben Ezra has the pithy remark, "Depend not upon thy riches nor thy strength, for the strength thou hadst from him, also the riches." Kimchi comments on the same more fully, as follows: "On this condition thou canst rest and not be afraid of the enemy, if thou wilt observe to do mercy and judgment: for his conditions are as he said, 'I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.' And although he does not mention righteousness here, yet he has said in another place, 'Keep ye judgment, and to justice [literally, 'righteousness'].' And he says here, 'And wait upon thy God continually;' now it is righteousness and equity that thou waitest on thy God continually. And even when thou shalt have great possession and riches and wealth, thou shalt say to thyself, ' It is all from him; thou shall remember him continually and wait on him, as he says in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>), ' Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; not like Ephraim, who says, 'I am become rich, I have found me out substance.'" The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>, equivalent to "draw near <span class="accented">to</span>," having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 Ephraim feeds himself with vain hopes of help from man, when he is at enmity with God. The Jews vainly thought to secure the Egyptians by a present of the produce of their country. Judah is contended with also. God sees the sin of his own people, and will reckon with them for it. They are put in mind of what Jacob did, and what God did for him. When his faith upon the Divine promise prevailed above his fears, then by his strength he had power with God. He is Jehovah, the same that was, and is, and is to come. What was a revelation of God to one, is his memorial to many, to all generations. Then let those who have gone from God, be turned to him. Turn thou to the Lord, by repentance and faith, as thy God. Let those that are converted to him, walk with him in all holy conversation and godliness. Let us wrestle with Him for promised blessings, determined not to give over till we prevail; and let us seek Him in his ordinances.</body></html>
