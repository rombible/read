The example is more fully described and dwelt on in this verse for the purpose of more powerfully stimulating the Israelites of the prophet's day to imitate it. From this verse we learn the following facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the nature of the conflict as of a spiritual kind; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the visible embodiment of the invisible deity, so that the angel is not an entire identification with God in the preceding verse, but the organ of Divine manifestation; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the weapons used, or the means employed, namely, weeping and supplication, in a word, the instrumentality of prayer; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the true way of prevailing with God, which is real humility and sin-core supplication, not stiff, necked and defiant resistance to the Divine will and word, like that of Israel at the period in question. This verse "is," according to Aben Ezra, "<span class="accented">an</span> explanation how he put forth prowess with God." Kimchi regards it as "the repetition of the same thought for the put. pose of intensifying, for it was a great wonder for a man to wrestle with an angel." <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> commences a new clause; while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the punctuation of it as a participle, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;</span>, and the connection of it with "prevailed," leaves the following clause isolated without any improvement of the sense. The rendering in this latter case would be "prevailed weeping," a somewhat awkward expression. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> there is an exposition adopted by the Hebrew expositors and advocated by Hitzig, which appears to us to do violence to the true signification of the passage. Thus Rashi: "And the angel besought him, ' Let me now go. The end of the Holy and Blessed One is that he may reveal himself to thee in Bethel, and there shalt thou find him.'" Similarly Aben Ezra: "He (the angel) almost wept and supplicated him to let him go. And the signification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>, is: 'before the light strengthened, that Jacob might not be alarmed.'" Also Kimchi: "This is not mentioned in the Thorah; and the explanation is as if the angel wept and supplicated Jacob to let him go, as he said, 'Let me go, for' the day breaketh.'" Such exposition introduces into the text an intolerable anthropopathism. Jerome long before had given the correct explanation thus: "<span class="accented">He</span> wept and asked him, when he said, 'I will not let thee go, unless thou shalt have blessed me!' For the wrestling was that which he engaged in with the angel, holding him by prayers that he might bless him, not by the strength of work. If any one weeps and exercises penitence, and supplicates the Lord, he shall find him in the grief of his heart, and when he has invoked him, he shall hear him answering." <span class="cmt_word">He found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us.</span> The prophet here records the result of Jacob's faithful wrestling. Them in Bethel, the very place where years after idolatry and immorality found a home, God had manifested himself to the patriarch. The fruit of Jacob's victory was that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he found God at Bethel; not that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> God found him, as some explain it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The historical basis of the prophet's statement is not <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>, which narrates the appearance of God to the patriarch as he fled into Mesopotamia, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>, when the new name of Israel, "prince with God," was confirmed to him, and the promise of all the families of the earth being blessed through his seed renewed. Of the two visions at Bethel the second is the one here referred to, as it comes after that at Penuel, the scene of the patriarch's wrestling with the angel; while the accompanying circumstances keep us to the right understanding of the expression, "He found him in Bethel," which we are considering. Jacob on that memorable occasion prepared himself and household for seeking God by putting away the strange gods that were among them, by ceremonial purifications, and putting on change of garments. Thus, seeking with holy purpose and prepared heart, he found the Lord at Bethel, and enjoyed heavenly fellowship with him there. Aben Ezra favors <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> making Jehovah, not Jacob, the subject; thus: "As he was returning to his father, the angel found him there; and because the angel appeared to him twice in Bethel, behold the place is the gate of heaven; therefore I and Amos have prophesied about Jeroboam at Bethel, which is the place of his kingdom." Kimchi approves of the exposition of the angel finding Jacob, but mentions a modification of that of Jacob finding the angel; thus: "The angel found him in Bethel and also blessed him there; and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, equivalent to 'found him,' is the future instead of the past. But my lord my father, of blessed memory, explains it according to its literal import, that the angel said to him (when wrestling with him) that he would find him in Bethel The blessed God announced to him the good tidings that he would there manifest himself to him and call his name Israel." The last clause of this verse states the additional fact that God spoke <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> through the patriarch to his posterity. "Let it be observed," says Lackemacher, as quoted by Keil, "that God is said to have talked at Bethel, not with Jacob only, but with all his posterity. That is to say, the things which are here said to have been done by Jacob, and to have happened to him, had not regard to himself only, but to all the race that sprang from him, and were signs of the good fortune which they either would or certainly might enjoy." Though the suffix of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, in the Massoretic text is well attested, yet, instead of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the third person, Ewald reads it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> as the first plural, and consequently so renders the word that the clause implies, not a narrative of the past, but a prophecy of the future; thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "He will find at Bethel, and there he will speak with us." The. Septuagint, again, with other Greek versions, as also the Syriac and Arabic, read in the last part of the clause <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>, equivalent "to him," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "us," which identifies the patriarch with his posterity. The translation by which a relative is understood before <span class="accented">immanu, equiva</span>lent to "Them he spoke to Jacob the things that are with <span class="accented">us</span>," or "happened us," or "pertained to us," is neither necessary nor in accordance with good taste. Kimchi understands the verb in the present tense that is, God speaks <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">with us</span> - Hosea and the other prophets, to reprove the idolatry rampant in Bethel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> rather with the  prophet and the people descended from the patriarch. On the words, "there he spake with us," Kimchi comments as follows: "These are the words of the prophet. He says, ' There in Bethel he (Jehovah) speaks with me and with Amos to reprove Israel for the worship of the calf in Bethel,' as Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a>) says, 'Seek ye me, and ye shall live: but seek not Bethel.' But my lord my father, of blessed memory, explained 'And there he will speak with us' as the words of the angel. He (the angel) says to him (Jacob), 'The blessed God will find us in Bethel, and there he will speak <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> with us, with me and with thee, in order to confirm to thee my blessing, and to call thy name Israel, saying, For as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.'" But others, as Saadia Gaon, explain the word, not in the sense of "with us," but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> "on account of us," or "about us." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 Ephraim feeds himself with vain hopes of help from man, when he is at enmity with God. The Jews vainly thought to secure the Egyptians by a present of the produce of their country. Judah is contended with also. God sees the sin of his own people, and will reckon with them for it. They are put in mind of what Jacob did, and what God did for him. When his faith upon the Divine promise prevailed above his fears, then by his strength he had power with God. He is Jehovah, the same that was, and is, and is to come. What was a revelation of God to one, is his memorial to many, to all generations. Then let those who have gone from God, be turned to him. Turn thou to the Lord, by repentance and faith, as thy God. Let those that are converted to him, walk with him in all holy conversation and godliness. Let us wrestle with Him for promised blessings, determined not to give over till we prevail; and let us seek Him in his ordinances.</body></html>
