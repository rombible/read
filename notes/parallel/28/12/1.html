On the latter passage Wetzstein remarks:--"This wind is more frequent in winter and early spring, when, if it continues long, the tender vegetation is parched up, and a year of famine follows. Both man and beast feel sickly while it prevails." Hence, that which is unpleasant and revolting in life is compared by Orientals to the east wind. The idea expressed by the east wind here is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-2.htm" title="Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?">Job 15:2</a>, combining the notions of destructiveness and emptiness. The covenant with Assyria refers to the events of the reign of Hoshea. Covenants with Assyria, and presents to Egypt were to Hosea curses in disguise. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm" title="Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.">Hosea 7:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind.</span> "Wind" is employed figuratively to denote what is empty and vain, of no real worth or practical benefit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To feed on wind is to take pleasure in or draw sustenance from what can really afford neither; while following after the east wind is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to pursue vain hopes and ideals which are unattainable. According to this view, the prominent idea of the east wind is its fleetness, which passed into a proverb; thus Horace says, "Agents nimbos Oeior Euro." To outrun the swift and stormy east wind would represent an undertaking at once impracticable and hopeless. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the blasting influence of the east wind that is referred to, so that it is a figurative representation, not so much of what is vain and hopeless, as of what is pernicious and destructive. Thus their course was not only idle, but injurious; not only delusive, but destructive; not only fruitless, but fatal. Their career, which is thus represented, included their idolatry and foreign alliances Kimchi explains this clause as follows: "In his service of the calves he is like him who opens his mouth to the wind and feeds on it, though he cannot support life thereby." And followeth after the east wind; ' he repeats the sense in different words, and mentions the east wind because it is the strongest and most injurious of winds to the sons of men. So with them: it is not enough that the idolatry of the calves does not profit them, but it actually injures them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to "But Ephraim is an evil spirit; he has chased the east wind." <span class="cmt_word">He daily</span> (rather, <span class="accented">all the day</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>increaseth lies and desolation.</span> Some understood these words <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as descriptive of Ephraim's attitude towards Jehovah; and thus what is figuratively set forth in the first clause is here represented literally. Thus Kimchi says, "He does not turn back from his wickedness, but all the days he multiplies lying which is the worship of the calves, and so increases the desolation and destruction that shall come as a punishment for their service. And with all this he does not perceive nor return from the worship of the calves to the worship of the blessed God." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> we prefer understanding the second clause of Ephraim's conduct towards his neighbor or fellow-man. Titus, Hitzig, who shows that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> cannot refer to their conduct towards Jehovah, nor could their lies and desolation continue the whole day if referred to his service. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;</span>, "<span class="accented">violence and</span> <span class="accented">robbery</span>," or "spoil," are also jointed in a similar manner in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>, to characterize men's conduct towards their neighbors. In the passage before us, if we refer the words, "lies and desolation," as we think they ought to be referred, to Ephraim's conduct towards men, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span> may be distinguished thus: the former designates low lying and fraudulent dealing; while the latter expresses that brutal violence by which dishonest men unscrupulously take possession of their neighbors' property. <span class="cmt_word">And they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt</span>. This fondness for foreign alliances is specified as a positive proof of their apostasy from, and want of confidence in, Jehovah. This is well explained by Kimchi in the following comment: "But what doeth Ephraim? When oppression of the enemy comes upon him, they make a covenant with Assyria for their assistance, and likewise with Egypt - one time with this, another time with that." The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, "to cut a covenant," has its parallel in the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and Latin <span class="accented">foedus fetire</span>, as also in the Arabic, doubtless from the circumstance of slaying the victims in its ratification. The conduct here censured is Ephraim's faithlessness to the then static covenant rather than their treacherous maneuvering in "playing off" Egypt against Assyria, and Assyria against Egypt alternately. The land of Israel abounded in oil-olive and honey, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a> and elsewhere. The object of sending it to Egypt was as a present to the Egyptians to secure their interest and help against Assyria. It is thus properly explained both by Rash! and Kimchi. The former says, "And their oil they bring to Egypt to give it to them as a present that they may help them;" the latter likewise, "They bring their oil to the Egyptians for a present, for oil came to Egypt and to other lands out of the land of Israel. The land of Israel was rich in olive oil." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 Ephraim feeds himself with vain hopes of help from man, when he is at enmity with God. The Jews vainly thought to secure the Egyptians by a present of the produce of their country. Judah is contended with also. God sees the sin of his own people, and will reckon with them for it. They are put in mind of what Jacob did, and what God did for him. When his faith upon the Divine promise prevailed above his fears, then by his strength he had power with God. He is Jehovah, the same that was, and is, and is to come. What was a revelation of God to one, is his memorial to many, to all generations. Then let those who have gone from God, be turned to him. Turn thou to the Lord, by repentance and faith, as thy God. Let those that are converted to him, walk with him in all holy conversation and godliness. Let us wrestle with Him for promised blessings, determined not to give over till we prevail; and let us seek Him in his ordinances.</body></html>
