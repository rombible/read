The rendering "he is a merchant" originates from the fact that Canaan (rendered "merchant") is often used predominantly of Ph?nicia, and Canaanites of Ph?nicians, the great trading race (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-11.htm" title="He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD has given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof.">Isaiah 23:11</a>; Job 40:30). Translate: <span class= "ital">As for Canaan, in his hand are false balances. He loves cheating.</span> The descendants of Canaan (the son of Ham, the abhorred son of Noah) became in their whole career a curse and a bye-word in every religious and ethical sense. The princes of Tyre, the merchandise of Ph?nicia, were, perhaps, then in the prophet's mind. (Comp. Ezekiel 27)<p>Moreover, the prophet hints that Ephraim had imbibed Ph?nicia's love of gain and habits of unscrupulous trade. The literature of this period contains frequent references to these tendencies in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm" title="Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm" title="Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?">Micah 6:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-14</span> contain a fresh description of Israel's apostasy. To this the prophet is led by the preceding train of thought. When he called to mind the earnestness of the patriarch to obtain the blessing, the sincerity of his repentance, and the evidences of conversion, consisting in mercy and judgment and constant waiting on God, he looks around on Israel, and finding those virtues conspicuous by their absence., he repeats the story of their degeneracy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is a merchant</span> (margin, <span class="accented">Canaan</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress</span>. This verse is more exactly rendered, <span class="accented">Canaan is he, in his hand are the balances of deceit: he loveth to oppress</span>. How the sons have degenerated from the sire! No longer do we see Jacob wrestling in prayer with the angel of the covenant, and knighted in the field with the name of Israel, or "prince with God;" but a fraudulent merchant <span class="accented">Kenaan</span>, seeking to aggrandize himself by cheating and oppression. His conduct is the opposite of what God requires; instead of the mercy and judgment and trust in God enjoined in the preceding verse, we have the Canaanitish (Phoenician) trader, with his false scales in his hand and the love of oppression in his heart. The word Kenaan sometimes denotes <span class="accented">Canaan</span>, the son of Ham, and ancestor of the Canaanitish nation; sometimes the <span class="accented">land of Canaan</span>, or lowlands (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, bow the knee, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">genu</span>, knee; then "to be low" or "depressed") as opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, or" highlands" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, to be high); sometimes <span class="accented">Phoenicia</span>, the northern part of Canaan; also, from the Canaanites or Phoenicians having been famous as merchants, a <span class="accented">man of Canaan</span>, or any <span class="accented">merchant</span>, so <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40.htm">Job 40</a>:30 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>, just as <span class="accented">Kasdi Chaldaean</span> is applied to an astrologer. At the time of Hosea, the Phoenicians were the great merchants who had the commerce of the world in their hand. Canaan is thus a figurative designation of Ephraim in their degenerate condition as indicated by the false balances and love of oppression. The verse is well explained by Theodoret: "And thou, Ephraim, imitating <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">wickedness of Canaan</span>, hast an unjust balance of mind: thou despisest justice, thou greedily desirest unjust power, thou art high-minded in rich, S, and dost arrogate to thyself very much in prescribing and determining the conditions thereof." Rashi more briefly remarks, "Ye depend upon your wealth because ye are merchants and defraud; and of your riches ye say, 'Yet I have become rich, and shall not serve the Holy One;'" while Kimchi marks the contrast between Israel as he ought to be and Israel as he actually is, thus: "But thou art not so (i.e. practicing love and righteousness), but thou art like the Canaanite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">the merchant</span>, in whose hand is the deceitful balance." The character of the Phoenician trader is thus given in the 'Odyssey' - "A false Phoenician of insidious mind, Vers'd in vile arts, and foe to humankind." But, in addition to secret fraud, open violence is here charged against Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-14 Ephraim became a merchant: the word also signifies a Canaanite. They carried on trade upon Canaanitish principles, covetously and with fraud and deceit. Thus they became rich, and falsely supposed that Providence favoured them. But shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. Let them remember, not only what a mighty prince Jacob was with God, but what a servant he was to Laban. The benefits we have had from the word of God, make our sin and folly the worse, if we put any slight upon that word. We had better follow the hardest labour in poverty, than grow rich by sin. We may form a judgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with that of ancient believers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises the message of God, will perish. May we all hear his word with humble, obedient faith.</body></html>
