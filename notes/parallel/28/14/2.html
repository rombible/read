(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-17.htm" title="The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.">Psalm 51:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take with you words, and turn to the Lord.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some render this clause. "Take with you [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. forget not, neglect not, but receive with obedient spirit] my words." This rendering is obviously erroneous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The correct translation is that of the Authorized Version, and the words referred to are such as express prayer for pardon and confession of sin - the audible sound of the heart's desires. There is an allusion, perhaps, to the requirement of the Law: "None shall appear before me empty." Not outward sacrifices, but words of confession, were the offering to be presented. Thus Cyril eloquently explains it: "Ye shall propitiate the Deity, not by making offerings of riches, not by dedicating gold, not by honoring him with silver vessels, not gladdening him by sacrifices of oxen, not by slaughtering of birds; but ye shall give him discourses and wish to praise the Lord of the universe, appeasing him." To the same purport is the exposition of Aben Ezra: "He desires not from you, when ye go to seek his favor, treasures or burnt offerings, only words with which ye are to confess;" so also Kimchi: "He does not require of you on your return to him silver or gold or offering, which the Israelites lavished at great expense on their idols, but good works with which ye are to confess your iniquities." <span class="cmt_word">Say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously.</span> On turning to the Lord with their whole heart, not with their lips only, they are furnished with a form of sound words which God by his prophet puts into their mouth. Elsewhere a formula is prescribed, thus: "Publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy people, the remnant of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a>); compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-35.htm">1 Chronicles 16:35</a>. The position of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> before the verb creates a difficulty and causes diversity of rendering; for example, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> besides the ordinary rendering, which takes <span class="accented">kol</span> as holding its peculiar position by an hypallage, there is a modification of it: "All take away of iniquity." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some supply <span class="accented">mem</span>, and translate accordingly: "From all take away iniquity." Kimchi explains it as a transposition: "All iniquity forgive," and compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>; or, understanding <span class="accented">le</span>, "Forgive to every one iniquity." The object of the separation may be for greater emphasis. In like manner, the following clause is also subject to diversity of translation and interpretation. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the rendering of the Authorized Version, which appears to supply <span class="accented">le</span> before <span class="accented">tov</span>: "Receive <span class="accented">us</span> for good," viz. <span class="accented">in bonam partem</span>, or graciously; or, "receive <span class="accented">our prayer</span> graciously." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Another rendering or exposition is: "Take what is good (of thine own to bestow it on us);" thus in the sixty-eighth psalm at the nineteenth verse God is said to receive gifts among men, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for distribution among men, and hence the apostle, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>, substitutes <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>, and thus expresses the sense. The literal sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is the correct sense, namely, "and receive good:" "And receive good," says Jerome, "for unless thou hadst borne away our evil things we could not possibly have any good thing to offer thee, according to that which is written, 'Cease from evil and do good.'" Thus also the words are translated and interpreted by Pusey: "When then Israel and, in him, the penitent soul, is taught to <span class="accented">say, receive good</span>, it can mean only the good which thou thyself hast given; as David says, ' Of thine own we have given thee;" while he adds in a note on these words, "No one would have doubted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d8;</span> means, 'receive good,' as just before, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> means 'take words,' but for the seeming difficulty - What good had they?" <span class="cmt_word">So will we</span> <span class="cmt_word">render the calves of our lips</span>. This is more accurately rendered, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "So will we render young bullocks, even our lips." The word <span class="accented">shillem, to</span> render, or repay, is almost technical in its application to thank offer-tugs or sacrifices in fulfillment of a vow; the best animals for thank offerings were parm, or young oxen; but the lips, that is, the utterances of the lips, consisting of prayers or praises, or both, are to take the place of the animal sacrifices offered in thanksgiving. Thus the psalmist says, "I will praise the Name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Septuagint, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, renders by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> which the inspired author of Hebrews alludes, "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks [margin, 'confessing'] to his Name;" or perhaps the reference in Hebrews is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, "I create the fruit of the lips." Further, as words of confession in ver. 2 take the place of sacrifices of sin offerings, so here words of thanksgiving replace sacrifices of thanksgiving. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hosea/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-3 Israel is exhorted to return unto Jehovah, from their sins and idols, by faith in his mercy, and grace through the promised Redeemer, and by diligently attending on his worship and service. Take away iniquity; lift it off as a burden we are ready to sink under, or as the stumbling-block we have often fallen over. Take it all away by a free and full forgiveness, for we cannot strike any of it off. Receive our prayer graciously. They do not say what good they seek, but refer it to God. It is not good of the world's showing, but good of God's giving. They were to consider their sins, their wants, and the remedy; and they were to take, not sacrifices, but words stating the desires of their hearts, and with them to address the Lord. The whole forms a clear description of the nature and tendency of a sinner's conversion to God through Jesus Christ. As we draw near to God by the prayer of faith, we should first beseech him to teach us what to ask. We must be earnest with him to take away all iniquity.</body></html>
