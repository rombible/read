In the preliminary creation record (7-27) it is simply stated that God created man, male and female; there is a complete absence of details as to the Divine <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> in the execution of these, his last and greatest works. It is one object, among others, of the second portion of the history to supply those details. With regard to man (Adam), an account of his formation, at once minute and exhaustive, has been given in the preceding verses (7-17); now, with like attention to antecedent and concomitant circumstances and events, the sacred penman adds a description of the time, reason, manner, and result of the formation of woman. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God said, It is not good for man to be alone.</span> While the animals were produced either in swarms (as the fishes) or in pairs (as the birds and beasts), man was created as an individual; his partner, by a subsequent operation of creative power, being produced from himself. With the wild phantasies and gross speculations of some theosophists, as to whether, prior to the creation of Eve, Adam was androgynic (Bohme), or simply <span class="accented">vir</span> in <span class="accented">potentia</span>, out of which state he passed the moment the woman stood by his side (Ziegler), a devout exegesis is not required to intermeddle. Neither is it needful to wonder how God should pronounce that to be not good which he had previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>) affirmed was good. The Divine judgment of which the preceding chapter speaks was expressed at the completion of man's creation; this, while that creation was in progress. For the new-made man to have been left without a partner would, in the estimation of Jehovah Elohim, have been for him a condition of being which, if not necessarily bad in itself, yet, considering his intellectual and social nature, "would eventually have passed over from the negative not good, or a manifest want, into the positive not good, or a hurtful impropriety"' (Lange). "It was not good for man to be alone; not, as certain foolish Rabbis conceited, lest he should imagine himself to be the lord of the world, or as though no man could live without a woman, which is contrary to Scripture; but in respect of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> mutual society and comfort, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the propagation of the race, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the increase and generation of the Church of God, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the promised seed of the woman (Willet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Accordingly, Jehovah Elohim, for whom (seeing that his nature is to dispense happiness to his creatures) no more than for Adam would it have been good that man, being what he <span class="accented">was</span>, should remain alone, said, <span class="cmt_word">I will provide a help meet for him</span>; literally, an helper, as over against him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> corresponding to him, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; ver. 20, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, LXX. The expression indicates that the forthcoming helper was to be of similar nature to the man himself, corresponding by way of supplement to the incompleteness of his lonely being, and in every way adapted to be his co-partner and companion. All that Adam's nature demanded for its completion, physically, intellectually, socially, was to be included in this <span class="accented">altera ego</span> who was soon to stand by his side. Thus in man s need, and woman's power to satisfy that need, is laid the foundation for the Divine institution of marriage, which was afterwards prescribed not for the first pair alone, but for all their posterity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Power over the creatures was given to man, and as a proof of this he named them all. It also shows his insight into the works of God. But though he was lord of the creatures, yet nothing in this world was a help meet for man. From God are all our helpers. If we rest in God, he will work all for good. God caused deep sleep to fall on Adam; while he knows no sin, God will take care that he shall feel no pain. God, as her Father, brought the woman to the man, as his second self, and a help meet for him. That wife, who is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a help meet for a man. See what need there is, both of prudence and prayer in the choice of this relation, which is so near and so lasting. That had need to be well done, which is to be done for life. Our first parents needed no clothes for covering against cold or heat, for neither could hurt them: they needed none for ornament. Thus easy, thus happy, was man in his state of innocency. How good was God to him! How many favours did he load him with! How easy were the laws given to him! Yet man, being in honour, understood not his own interest, but soon became as the beasts that perish.</body></html>
