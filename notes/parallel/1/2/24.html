Adam names this new product of creative power, as he had named others, but he knew nothing about young men leaving their father's house for the wife's sake. Moreover, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-5.htm" title="And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall join to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?">Matthew 19:5</a>, our Lord quotes these words as spoken by God, and the simplest interpretation of this declaration is that the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God to give this solemn sanction to marriage, founded upon Adam's words. The great and primary object of this part of the narrative is to set forth marriage as a Divine ordinance. The narrator describes Adam's want, pictures him as examining all animal life, and studying the habits of all creatures so carefully as to be able to give them names, but as returning from his search unsatisfied. At last one is solemnly brought to him who is his counterpart, and he calls her <span class= "ital">Ishah, </span>his feminine self, and pronounces her to be his very bone and flesh. Upon this, "He who at the beginning made them male and female "pronounced the Divine marriage law that man and wife are <span class= "ital">one flesh.</span><p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife.</span> There is nothing in the use of such terms as father and mother, or in the fact that the sentiment is prophetic, to prevent the words from being regarded as a continuation of Adam's speech, although, on the other hand, the statement of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5</a>) does not preclude the possibility of Moses being their author; but whether uttered by the first husband (Delitzsch, Macdonald) or by the historian (Calvin, Murphy), they must be viewed as an inspired declaration of the law of marriage. <span class="accented">Its basis</span> (fundamental reason and predisposing cause) they affirm to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the original relationship of man and woman, on the platform of creation; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the marriage union effected between the first pair. Its <span class="accented">nature</span> they explain to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a forsaking (on the part of the woman as well as the man) of father and mother - not filially, in respect of duty, but locally, in respect of habitation, and comparatively, in respect of affection; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a cleaving unto his wife, in a <span class="accented">conjugium corporis atque animce</span>. <span class="accented">Its result</span> is stated in the words which follow: <span class="cmt_word">and they shall be one flesh</span> (literally, into one flesh; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5</a>, LXX.). The language points to a unity of persons, and not simply to a conjunction of bodies, or a community of interests, or even a reciprocity of affections. Malachi (Malachi 2:15) and Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5</a>) explain this verse as teaching the indissoluble character of marriage and condemning the practice of polygamy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Power over the creatures was given to man, and as a proof of this he named them all. It also shows his insight into the works of God. But though he was lord of the creatures, yet nothing in this world was a help meet for man. From God are all our helpers. If we rest in God, he will work all for good. God caused deep sleep to fall on Adam; while he knows no sin, God will take care that he shall feel no pain. God, as her Father, brought the woman to the man, as his second self, and a help meet for him. That wife, who is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a help meet for a man. See what need there is, both of prudence and prayer in the choice of this relation, which is so near and so lasting. That had need to be well done, which is to be done for life. Our first parents needed no clothes for covering against cold or heat, for neither could hurt them: they needed none for ornament. Thus easy, thus happy, was man in his state of innocency. How good was God to him! How many favours did he load him with! How easy were the laws given to him! Yet man, being in honour, understood not his own interest, but soon became as the beasts that perish.</body></html>
