The laws given in these six days still continue their activity; they are still maintained, and there may even be with them progress and development. There is also something special on this seventh day; for in it the work of redemption was willed by the Father, wrought by the Son, and applied by the Holy Ghost. But there is no creative activity, as when vegetable or animal life began, or when a free agent first walked erect upon a world given him to subdue.<p>The substitution, in the LXX. and Syriac, of the <span class= "ital">sixth </span>for the seventh day, as that on which God ended His work, was probably made in order to avoid even the appearance of Elohim having put the finishing touches to creation on the Sabbath.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And on the seventh day God</span> (Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">ended his work which he had made.</span> To avert the possibility of imagining that any portion of the seventh day was consumed in working, which the English version seems to favor, the LXX., the Samaritan, and Syriac versions insert the <span class="accented">sixth</span> day in the text instead of the seventh. Calvin, Drusius, Le Clerc, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and Kalisch translate had <span class="accented">finished</span>. Others understand the sense to be <span class="accented">declared</span> the work to be finished, while Baumgarten and Delitzsch regard the resting as included in the completion of the work, and Von Bohlen thinks "the language is not quite precise." But <span class="accented">calah</span> followed by <span class="accented">rain</span> signifies to cease from prosecuting any work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-13.htm">1 Samuel 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-23.htm">Ezekiel 43:23</a>), and this was, negatively, the aspect of that sabbatic rest into which the Creator entered. <span class="cmt_word">And he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</span> <span class="accented">Shavath</span>, the primary idea of which is to sit still, depicts Elohim as desisting from his creative labors, and assuming a posture of quiescent repose. The expression is a pure anthropomorphism. "He who fainteth not, neither is weary" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>), can be conceived of neither as resting nor as needing rest through either exhaustion or fatigue. Cessation from previous occupation is all that is implied in the figure, and is quite compatible with continuous activity in other directions. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a> represents the Father as working from that period onward in the preservation and redemption of that world which by his preceding labors he had created and made. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-3 After six days, God ceased from all works of creation. In miracles, he has overruled nature, but never changed its settled course, or added to it. God did not rest as one weary, but as one well pleased. Notice the beginning of the kingdom of grace, in the sanctification, or keeping holy, of the sabbath day. The solemn observing of one day in seven as a day of holy rest and holy work, to God's honour, is the duty of all to whom God has made known his holy sabbaths. At this time none of the human race were in being but our first parents. For them the sabbath was appointed; and clearly for all succeeding generations also. The Christian sabbath, which we observe, is a seventh day, and in it we celebrate the rest of God the Son, and the finishing the work of our redemption.</body></html>
