For the great object of this hymn of creation is to give the sanction of the Creator to the Sabbath. Hence the ascribing of rest to Him who wearies not, and hence also the description of the several stages of creation as days. Labour is, no doubt, ennobled by creation being described as work done by God; but the higher purpose of this Scripture was that for which appeal is made to it in the Fourth Commandment, namely, to ennoble man's weekly rest. Among the Accadians, Mr. Sayce says (<span class= "ital">Chald. Genesis. </span>p. 89), the Sabbath was observed--so ancient is its institution--but it was connected with the sun, moon, and five planets, whence even now the days of the week take their titles, though the names of Scandinavian deities have been substituted in this country for some of their old Latin appellations. Here every idolatrous tendency is guarded against, and the Sabbath is the institution of the One Almighty God.<p><span class= "bld">The host of them.</span>--The word translated <span class= "ital">host </span>does not refer to military arrangement, but to numbers gathered in crowds. This crowded throng of heaven sometimes means the angels, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19</a>; oftener the stars. Here it is the host both of heaven and earth, and signifies the multitudes of living creatures which people the land, and seas, and air.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished.</span> Literally, and finished were the heavens and the earth, the emphatic position being occupied by the verb. With the creation of man upon the sixth day the Divine Artificer's labors were brought to a termination, and his work to a completion. The two ideas of cessation and perfection are embraced in the import of <span class="accented">calais</span>. Not simply had Elohim paused in his activity, but the Divine idea of his universe had been realized. The finished world was a cosmos, arranged, ornamented, and filled with organized, sentient, and rational beings, with plants, animals, and man; and now the resplendent fabric shone before him a magnificent success - "lo! very good." This appears to be by no means obscurely hinted at in the appended clause, <span class="cmt_word">and all the host of them</span>, which suggests the picture of a military armament arranged in marching order. <span class="accented">Tsebaam</span>, derived from <span class="accented">tsaba</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> go forth as a soldier (Gesenius), to join together for service (Furst), and applied to the angels (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm">2 Chronicles 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a>) and to the celestial bodies (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>), here includes, by Zeugma, the material heavens and earth with the angelic and human races (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>). If the primary signification of the root be splendor, glory, like <span class="accented">tsavah</span>, to some forth or shine out as a star (T. Lewis), then will the LXX. and the Vulgate be correct in translating <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="accented">omnis ornatus eorum</span>, the conception being that when the heavens and the earth were completed they were a brilliant army. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-3 After six days, God ceased from all works of creation. In miracles, he has overruled nature, but never changed its settled course, or added to it. God did not rest as one weary, but as one well pleased. Notice the beginning of the kingdom of grace, in the sanctification, or keeping holy, of the sabbath day. The solemn observing of one day in seven as a day of holy rest and holy work, to God's honour, is the duty of all to whom God has made known his holy sabbaths. At this time none of the human race were in being but our first parents. For them the sabbath was appointed; and clearly for all succeeding generations also. The Christian sabbath, which we observe, is a seventh day, and in it we celebrate the rest of God the Son, and the finishing the work of our redemption.</body></html>
