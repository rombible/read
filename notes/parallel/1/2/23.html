It means, therefore, <span class= "ital">this time, </span>or colloquially, <span class= "ital">at last. </span>Adam had long studied the natural world, and while, with their confidence as yet unmarred by human cruelty, they came to his call, grew tame, and joined his company, he found none that answered to his wants, and replied to him with articulate speech. At last, on waking from his trance, he found one standing by him in whom he recognised a second self, and he welcomed her joyfully, and exclaimed, "This <span class= "ital">at last </span>is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:" that is, she is man's counterpart, not merely in feeling and sense--his flesh--but in his solid qualities. In several of the Semitic dialects <span class= "ital">bone </span>is used for <span class= "ital">self. </span>Thus, in the <span class= "ital">Jerusalem Lectionary </span>(ed. Miniscalchi, Verona, 1861) we read: "I will manifest my bone unto him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>), that is, myself; and again, "I have power to lay it down of my bone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>), that is, of myself. So, too, in Hebrew, "In the selfsame day" is "in the bone of this day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm" title="In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;">Genesis 7:13</a>). Thus <span class= "ital">bone of my bones </span>means "my very own self," while <span class= "ital">flesh of my flesh </span>adds the more tender and gentle qualities.<p><span class= "bld">She shall be called Woman (Ishah), because she was taken out of Man (Ish).</span>--Adam, who knew that he was an Ish (see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>at end of this book), called the woman a "female Ish." The words of our Version, <span class= "ital">man </span>and <span class= "ital">woman </span>(perhaps womb-man), represent with sufficient accuracy the relation of the words in the original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Adam said.</span> Either as being possessed, while in a sinless state, of a power of intuitive perception which has been lost through the fall, or as speaking under Divine inspiration (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This now.</span> Literally, this tread, step, or stroke, meaning either this time, looking back to the previous review of the animal creation, as if he wished to say, At last one has come who is suitable to be my partner (Calvin); or, less probably, looking forward to the ordinary mode of woman's production, this time she is supernaturally formed (Bush). "The thrice repeated <span class="accented">this is</span> characteristic. It vividly points to the woman on whom, in joyful astonishment, the man's eye now rests with the full power of first love" (Delitzsch). Instinctively he recognizes her relation to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh</span>. The language is expressive at once of woman's derivation from man (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-8.htm">1 Corinthians 11:8, 12</a>) and likeness to man. The first of these implies her subordination or subjection to man, or man's headship over woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>), which Adam immediately proceeds to assert by assigning to her a name; the second is embodied in the name which she receives. <span class="cmt_word">She</span> (literally, to this) <span class="cmt_word">shall be called Woman</span> (<span class="accented">isha</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> maness, from <span class="accented">ish</span>, man. Cf. Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (Symmachus), from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>; Latin, <span class="accented">virago</span>, <span class="accented">virae</span> (old Latin), from <span class="accented">vir</span>; English, woman (womb-man, Anglo-Saxon), from man; German, <span class="accented">manninn</span>, from <span class="accented">mann</span>; Sanscrit, <span class="accented">hart</span>, from <span class="accented">nara</span>; Ethiopic, <span class="accented">beesith</span>, from <span class="accented">beesi</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>because she</span> (this) <span class="cmt_word">was taken from Man</span>. <span class="accented">Ish</span>, the name given by Adam to himself in contradistinction to his spouse, is interpreted as significant of man's authority (Gesenius), or of his social nature (Meier); but its exact etymology is involved in obscurity. Its relation to <span class="accented">Adham</span> is the same as that of <span class="accented">vir</span> to homo and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Power over the creatures was given to man, and as a proof of this he named them all. It also shows his insight into the works of God. But though he was lord of the creatures, yet nothing in this world was a help meet for man. From God are all our helpers. If we rest in God, he will work all for good. God caused deep sleep to fall on Adam; while he knows no sin, God will take care that he shall feel no pain. God, as her Father, brought the woman to the man, as his second self, and a help meet for him. That wife, who is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a help meet for a man. See what need there is, both of prudence and prayer in the choice of this relation, which is so near and so lasting. That had need to be well done, which is to be done for life. Our first parents needed no clothes for covering against cold or heat, for neither could hurt them: they needed none for ornament. Thus easy, thus happy, was man in his state of innocency. How good was God to him! How many favours did he load him with! How easy were the laws given to him! Yet man, being in honour, understood not his own interest, but soon became as the beasts that perish.</body></html>
