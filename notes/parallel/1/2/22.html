Thus woman is no casual or hasty production of nature, but is the finished result of labour and skill. Finally, she is brought with special honour to the man as the Creator's last and most perfect work. Every step and stage in this description is intended for the ennoblement of marriage. Woman is not made from the adamah, but from the adam. She is something that he once had, but has lost; and while for Adam there is simply the closing of the cavity caused by her withdrawal, she is moulded and re-fashioned, and built up into man's counterpart. She brings back more than the man parted with, and the Creator Himself leads her by the hand to her husband. The anthropomorphic language of these early chapters is part of that condescension to human weakness which makes it the rule everywhere for inspiration to use popular language. He who made heaven and earth by the fiat of His will must not be understood as having literally moulded the side taken from Adam as a sculptor would the plastic clay; nor did He assume human form that He might place her at man's side. Much of this may indeed have been represented to Adam's mind in the trance into which he had fallen; but the whole narrative has a nobler meaning, and the practical result of its teaching was that neither woman nor marriage ever sank into that utter degradation among the Jews which elsewhere aided so greatly in corrupting morals and men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made</span> <span class="cmt_word">he</span> (literally, builded into; <span class="accented">aedificavit</span>, Vulgate; <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.) <span class="cmt_word">a woman</span>. The peculiar phraseology employed to describe the formation of Adam s partner has been understood as referring to the physical configuration of woman s body, which is broadest towards the middle (Lyra); to the incompleteness of Adam's being, which was like an unfinished building until Eve was formed (Calvin); to the part of the female in building up the family (Delitzsch, Macdonald), to the building up of the Church, of which she was designed to be a type (Bonar); - yet it may be doubted if there is not as much truth in the remark that "by the many words used in the generation of mankind, as <span class="accented">creating</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), <span class="accented">making</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>), forming and <span class="accented">inspiring</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), and now <span class="accented">building</span>, Moses would set forth this wondrous workmanship for which the Psalmist so laudeth God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a> (Ainsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And brought her unto the man.</span> I.e. led, conducted, and presented her to Adam. "The word implies the solemn bestowment of her in the bonds of the marriage covenant, which is hence called the covenant of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>); implying that he is the Author of this sacred institution" (Bush). On awaking from his slumber Adam at once recognized the Divine intention, and joyfully welcomed his bride. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Power over the creatures was given to man, and as a proof of this he named them all. It also shows his insight into the works of God. But though he was lord of the creatures, yet nothing in this world was a help meet for man. From God are all our helpers. If we rest in God, he will work all for good. God caused deep sleep to fall on Adam; while he knows no sin, God will take care that he shall feel no pain. God, as her Father, brought the woman to the man, as his second self, and a help meet for him. That wife, who is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a help meet for a man. See what need there is, both of prudence and prayer in the choice of this relation, which is so near and so lasting. That had need to be well done, which is to be done for life. Our first parents needed no clothes for covering against cold or heat, for neither could hurt them: they needed none for ornament. Thus easy, thus happy, was man in his state of innocency. How good was God to him! How many favours did he load him with! How easy were the laws given to him! Yet man, being in honour, understood not his own interest, but soon became as the beasts that perish.</body></html>
