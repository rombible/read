Neither derivation has much authority for it in the Hebrew language, and we must wait for the true explanation till the cuneiform inscriptions have been more thoroughly examined. As two of the four rivers of Paradise rise in Armenia, so we must probably seek the other two there; but the conjectures of commentators have thus far suggested no probable identification of this stream.<p><span class= "bld">Compasseth.</span>--This word, without strictly meaning <span class= "ital">to go round, </span>gives the idea of a devious course (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.">1Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-3.htm" title="The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw you him whom my soul loves?">Song of Solomon 3:3</a>), as if the river had now reached a level plain.<p><span class= "bld">Havilah </span>may mean <span class= "ital">sandy land </span>(Deutsch), or <span class= "ital">circuit region. </span>There seems to have been more than one country of this name; but the most probable is that in South-Western Arabia, afterwards colonised by the Joktanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm" title="And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.">Genesis 10:29</a>), which this river skirted rather than traversed. But we know of no such river, rising in Armenia or elsewhere, which answers to this description now. Besides gold of great purity, pronounced emphatically "good," this land produced" bdellium," a scented gum, to which manna is compared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm" title="And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium.">Numbers 11:7</a>), though the meaning even there is uncertain.<p>Instead of <span class= "ital">bedolach, </span>bdellium, the Syriac reads <span class= "ital">berulche, </span>that is, the same word in the plural, but with <span class= "ital">d </span>instead of r. These two letters being very similar, not merely in the square Hebrew alphabet now in use, but in the original Samaritan characters, are constantly interchanged in manuscripts; and as <span class= "ital">berulche </span>means <span class= "ital">pearls, </span>the sense agrees better with the other productions of Havilah, gold and onyx stones. As <span class= "ital">bedolach </span>is a quadriliteral, while Hebrew words have only three root letters, we must look to the Accadi an language for its true signification, if this be really the right reading.<p><span class= "bld">The onyx stone.</span>--Though there is considerable authority for this translation, yet probably the LXX., supported by most ancient authorities, are right in regarding this gem as the beryl of a light green colour (leek-stone, LXX.). The root signifies something <span class= "ital">pale, </span>while the onyx has its name from its markings resembling those of the human nail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The name of the first</span> (river is) <span class="cmt_word">Pishon</span>, or "the full-flowing." This is the first of those marks by which the river, when discovered, must be identified. It was palpably a broad-bosomed stream. A second is derived from the region through which it flows. <span class="cmt_word">That is it which compasseth</span> (not necessarily surrounding, but skirting in a circular or circuitous fashion - <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-8.htm">Judges 11:8</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the whole land of Havilah</span>. Havilah itself is described by three of its productions. <span class="cmt_word">Where there is gold</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> it is a gold-producing country. <span class="cmt_word">And the gold of that land is good.</span> Of the purest quality and largest quantity. <span class="cmt_word">There also is bdellium.</span> Literally <span class="accented">bedo-lach</span>, which the manna was declared to resemble (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>). The LXX., supposing it to be a precious stone, translate it by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> the present passage, and by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a> - a view supported by the Jewish Rabbis and Gesenius. The majority of modern interpreters espouse the opinion of Josephus, that it was an odorous and costly gum indigenous to India, Arabia, Babylonia, and Bactriana. The third production <span class="cmt_word">is the onyx</span> (<span class="accented">shoham</span>, from a root signifying to be pale or delicate in color, like the finger-nails), variously conjectured to be the beryl, onyx, sardonyx, sardius, or emerald. From this description it appears that Havilah must be sought for among the gold-producing countries of Asia. Now among the sons of Joktan or primitive Arabs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>) - "whose dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest, unto Sephar, a mount of the east" - are Ophir and Havilah, whence Gesenius concludes that India, including Arabia, is meant. Other countries have their advocates, such as Arabia Felix, Susiana, Colchis, etc.; and other rivers, such as the Ganges (Josephus, Eusebius), the Phasis (Reland, Jahn, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Winer), the Indus (Schulthess, Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-14 The place fixed upon for Adam to dwell in, was not a palace, but a garden. The better we take up with plain things, and the less we seek things to gratify pride and luxury, the nearer we approach to innocency. Nature is content with a little, and that which is most natural; grace with less; but lust craves every thing, and is content with nothing. No delights can be satisfying to the soul, but those which God himself has provided and appointed for it. Eden signifies delight and pleasure. Wherever it was, it had all desirable conveniences, without any inconvenience, though no other house or garden on earth ever was so. It was adorned with every tree pleasant to the sight, and enriched with every tree that yielded fruit grateful to the taste and good for food. God, as a tender Father, desired not only Adam's profit, but his pleasure; for there is pleasure with innocency, nay there is true pleasure only in innocency. When Providence puts us in a place of plenty and pleasure, we ought to serve God with gladness of heart in the good things he gives us. Eden had two trees peculiar to itself. 1. There was the tree of life in the midst of the garden. Of this man might eat and live. Christ is now to us the Tree of life, Re 2:7; 22:2; and the Bread of life, Joh 6:48,51. 2. There was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, so called because there was a positive revelation of the will of God about this tree, so that by it man might know moral good and evil. What is good? It is good not to eat of this tree. What is evil? It is evil to eat of this tree. In these two trees God set before Adam good and evil, the blessing and the curse.</body></html>
