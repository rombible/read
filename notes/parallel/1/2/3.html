Literally, declared it holy, or set it apart for holy purposes. As afterwards Mount Sinai was sanctified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-23.htm">Exodus 19:23</a>), or, for the time being, invested with a sacred character as the residence of God; and Aaron and his sons were sanctified, or consecrated to the priestly office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>); and the year of Jubilee was sanctified, or devoted to the purposes of religion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), so here was the seventh day sanctified, or instituted in the interests of holiness, and as such proclaimed to be a holy day. <span class="cmt_word">Because that in it he had</span> <span class="cmt_word">rested from all his work which God had created and made</span>.

Calvin, Ainsworth, Bush, <span class="accented">et alii</span> take the second verb <span class="accented">emphatice</span>, as intensifying the action of the first, and conveying the idea of a perfect creation. Kalisch, Alford, and others explain the second as <span class="accented">epexegetic</span> of the first, as in the similar phrases, "spoke, saying, literally, spoke to speak" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-10.htm">Exodus 6:10</a>), and "<span class="accented">labor</span>ed to do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>). Onkelos, the Vulgate (<span class="accented">quod Dens creavit ut faceret</span>), Calvin, Tayler Lewis, etc. understand the infinitive in a <span class="accented">relic</span> sense, as expressive of the purpose for which the heavens and the earth were at first created, viz., that by the six days' work they might be fashioned into a cosmos. It has been observed that the usual concluding formula is not appended to the record of the seventh day, and the reason has perhaps been declared by Augustine: "Dies autem septimus sine vespera eat, nee habet occasum, quia sanctificasti eum ad permansionem sempiternam" ('Confess.,' 13:36). But now what was this seventh day which received Elohim's benediction? On the principle of interpretation applied to the creative days, this must be regarded as a period of indefinite duration, compounding to the human era of both Scripture and geology. But other Scriptures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-12.htm">Deuteronomy 5:12</a>, etc.) show that the Hebrews were enjoined by God to observe a seventh day rest in imitation of himself. There are also indications that sabbatic observance was not unknown to the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27, 28</a>), to the antediluvians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6-12</a>), and to Cain and Abel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>). Profane history likewise vouches for the veracity of the statement of Josephus, that "there is not any city of the Grecians, nor any of the barbarians, nor any nation whatsoever, whither our custom of resting on the seventh day hath not come" ('Contra Apionem,' 2:40). The ancient Persians, Indians, and Germans esteemed the number seven as sacred. By the Greeks and Phoenicians a sacred character was ascribed to the seventh day. The Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and other nations of antiquity were acquainted with the hebdomadal division of time. Travelers have detected traces of it among the African and American aborigines. To account for its existence among nations so widely apart, both chronologically and geographically, recourse has been had to some violent hypotheses; as, e.g., to the number of the primary planets known to the ancients (Humboldt), the division of a lunar month into four nearly equal periods of seven days (Ideler, Baden Powell, etc.), Jewish example (Josephus). Its true genesis, however, must be sought for in the primitive observance of a seventh day rest in accordance with Divine appointment. Precisely as we reason that the early and widespread prevalence of sacrifice can only be explained by an authoritative revelation to the first parents of the human family of such a mode of worship, so do we conclude that a seventh day sabbath must have been prescribed to man in Eden. The question then arises, Is this sabbath also referred to in the Mosaic record of the seventh day? The popular Belief is that the institution of the weekly sabbath alone is the subject spoken of in the opening verses of the present chapter; and the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> may at first sight appear to warrant this conclusion. A more careful consideration of the phraseology employed by Moses, how ever, shows that in the mind of the Hebrew lawgiver there existed a distinction between God's seventh day and man's sabbath, and that, instead of identifying the two, he meant to teach that the first was the reason of the second; as thus - "In six days God made.... and rested on the seventh day; where fore God blessed the (weekly) sabbath day, and hallowed it." Here it is commonly assumed that the words are exactly parallel to those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, and that the sabbath in Exodus corresponds to the seventh day of Genesis. But this is open to debate. The seventh day which God blessed in Eden was the first day of human life, and not the seventh day; and it is certain that God did not rest from his labors on man's seventh day, but on man's first. We feel inclined then to hold with Luther that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> Moses says nothing about man's day, and that the seventh day which received the Divine benediction was God's own great aeonian period of sabbatic rest. At the same time, for the reasons above specified, believing that a weekly sabbath was pre scribed to man from the beginning, we have no difficulty in assenting to the words of Tayler Lewis: "'And God blessed the seventh day.' Which seventh day, the greater or the less, the Divine or the human, the aeonian or the astronomical? Both, is the easy answer; both, as commencing at the same time, so far as the one connects with astronomical time; both, as the greater including the less; both, as being (the one as represented, the other as typically representing) the same essence and idea." It does not appear necessary to refute the idea that the weekly sabbath had no existence till the giving of the law, and that it is only here proleptically referred to by Moses. In addition to the above-mentioned historical testimonies to the antiquity of the Sabbath, the Fifth Tablet in the Chaldean Creation Series, after referring to the fourth day's work, proceeds: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"On the seventh day he appointed a holy day,<br />And to cease from all business he commanded.<br />Then arose the sun in the horizon of heaven in (glory)."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>thus apparently affirming that, in the opinion of the early Babylonians, the institution of the sabbath was coeval with the creation. (<span class="accented">Vid</span>. 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 117.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-3 After six days, God ceased from all works of creation. In miracles, he has overruled nature, but never changed its settled course, or added to it. God did not rest as one weary, but as one well pleased. Notice the beginning of the kingdom of grace, in the sanctification, or keeping holy, of the sabbath day. The solemn observing of one day in seven as a day of holy rest and holy work, to God's honour, is the duty of all to whom God has made known his holy sabbaths. At this time none of the human race were in being but our first parents. For them the sabbath was appointed; and clearly for all succeeding generations also. The Christian sabbath, which we observe, is a seventh day, and in it we celebrate the rest of God the Son, and the finishing the work of our redemption.</body></html>
