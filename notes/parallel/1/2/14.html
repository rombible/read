The word Hiddekel is startling as being a quadriliteral, but the Samaritan Codex reads <span class= "ital">the Dehel, </span>that is, it has the article instead of the Hebrew Kheth. Mr. Sayce accepts the uncertain reading Hiddekel, and says (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>p. 84) that <span class= "ital">Hid </span>is the Accadian name for river. <span class= "ital">Dekel, </span>Tigris, is said to mean an arrow. The Samaritan reading is probably right.<p><span class= "bld">Euphrates.</span>--No description is given of this as being the largest and best known of Asiatic rivers. Hence, probably, the Pison and Gihon were but small streams. <span class= "ital">Euphrates </span>is the Greek manner of pronouncing the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Phrath, </span>the first syllable being simply a help in sounding the double consonant. In Accadian it is called <span class= "ital">Purrat, </span>and means "the curving water," being so named from its shape.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the third river is the, Hiddekel</span>, or "the darting," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, a sharp and swift arrow, referring to its rapidity. It is unanimously agreed that this must be identified with the Tigris; in the present language of the Persians designated <span class="accented">tir</span>, which signifies an arrow. It is styled in Aramaic <span class="accented">diglath</span> or <span class="accented">diglah</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>That is it which goeth towards the east of Assyria</span>. Its identity is thus placed beyond a question. <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth river is Euphrates</span>, or "the sweet,' from an unused root, <span class="accented">parath</span>, signifying to be sweet, referring to the sweet and pleasant taste of its waters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>). Further description of this great water was unnecessary, being universally known to the Hebrews as "the great river" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>), and "the river" <span class="accented">par excellence</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>). The river still bears its early name. In the cuneiform inscriptions deciphered by Rawlinson it is called "Ufrata." Recurring now to the site of Eden, it must be admitted that, notwithstanding this description, the whole question is involved in uncertainty. The two solutions of the problem that have the greatest claim on our attention are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that which places Eden near the head of the Persian Gulf, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that which looks for it in Armenia. The latter is favored by the close proximity to that region of the sources of both the Euphrates and the Tigris; but, on the other hand, it is hampered by the difficulty of discovering other two rivers that will correspond with the Gihon and the Pison, and the almost certainty that Cush and Havilah are to be sought for in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf. The former (Calvin, Kalisch, T. Lewis) is supported by this last consideration, that Cush and Havilah are not remote from the locality, though it too has its encumbrances. It seems to reverse the idea of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, which according to Le Clerc indicates the direction of the stream. Then its advocates, no more than the supporters of the alternate theory, are agreed upon the Gihon and the Pison: Calvin finding them in the two principal mouths of the Euphrates and the Tigris, which Sir Charles Lyell declares to be of comparatively recent formation; Kalisch identifying them with the Indus and the Nile; and Taylor Lewis regarding them as the two sides of the Persian Gulf. Sir H. Rawlinson, from a study of the Assyrian texts, has pointed out the coincidence of the Babylonian region of Karduniyas or Garduniyas with the Eden of the Bible; and the late George Smith finds in its four rivers, Euphrates, Tigris, Surappi, and Ukui, its known fertility, and its name, Gandunu, so similar to Ganeden (the garden of Eden), "considerations all tending towards the view that it is the paradise of Genesis" ('Chald. Genesis,' pp. 3-305). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-14 The place fixed upon for Adam to dwell in, was not a palace, but a garden. The better we take up with plain things, and the less we seek things to gratify pride and luxury, the nearer we approach to innocency. Nature is content with a little, and that which is most natural; grace with less; but lust craves every thing, and is content with nothing. No delights can be satisfying to the soul, but those which God himself has provided and appointed for it. Eden signifies delight and pleasure. Wherever it was, it had all desirable conveniences, without any inconvenience, though no other house or garden on earth ever was so. It was adorned with every tree pleasant to the sight, and enriched with every tree that yielded fruit grateful to the taste and good for food. God, as a tender Father, desired not only Adam's profit, but his pleasure; for there is pleasure with innocency, nay there is true pleasure only in innocency. When Providence puts us in a place of plenty and pleasure, we ought to serve God with gladness of heart in the good things he gives us. Eden had two trees peculiar to itself. 1. There was the tree of life in the midst of the garden. Of this man might eat and live. Christ is now to us the Tree of life, Re 2:7; 22:2; and the Bread of life, Joh 6:48,51. 2. There was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, so called because there was a positive revelation of the will of God about this tree, so that by it man might know moral good and evil. What is good? It is good not to eat of this tree. What is evil? It is evil to eat of this tree. In these two trees God set before Adam good and evil, the blessing and the curse.</body></html>
