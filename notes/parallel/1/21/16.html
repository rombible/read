Day after day the mother, with her child, had wandered in the wilderness, using the water in the skin sparingly, ever hoping to come to some spring, but with too little knowledge of the locality to guide her steps wisely. At last the water is spent, and the young life withers first, and the mother knows that soon they both must die. They had made their last effort, and with that hopelessness which travellers have so often described as stealing over the lost wanderer in the desert, they yield themselves to their doom. The boy is entirely passive; but not so the mother. A softer nature would have remained with him to soothe him, but the agony of the wild Egyptian will grant her no rest. She casts his fainting body almost angrily under a shrub, and withdraws to a bowshot distance, because she cannot bear to see him die. She there gives way not to tears only, but to unrestrained outcries of grief. But it is not her loud lamentation, but the mute prayer of Ishmael that is heard, and an angel of God comes to her relief.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she went, and sat her down</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>, the pronoun being added to the verb, as an ethical dative, to indicate that the action was of special importance to her, meaning, "she, for herself, or for her part, sat down" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrews Synt. ,' &sect; 315, a.; and Glass, 'Phil Tract.,' 1. 3. tr. 2. c. 6; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>) - over against him a good way off. The hiph. inf. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, to go far away, to recede from any one, is here used adverbially, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a> (Gesenius, Furst, Kalisch), though by others it is understood as explaining the action of the previous verbs, and as equivalent to a gerund in <span class="accented">do</span>, or a participle, <span class="accented">elon</span>-<span class="accented">gando se</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller), or simply" removing to a distance" (Ewald; <span class="accented">vide</span> 'Hebrews Synt., &sect; 280 a.). <span class="cmt_word">As it were a bowshot</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">as those who draw the bow, i.e.</span> as far off as archers are accustomed to place the target (Keil). The sense is correctly given by the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For she said, Let me not see</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> look upon with anguish (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">the death of the child</span> - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept</span>. The verbs, being feminine, indicate that it is Hagar's grief which is here described, and that the rendering, "and the child lifted up his voice and wept" (LXX.), is incorrect; although the next verse may suggest that Ishmael, like his mother, was also dissolved in tears. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:14-21 If Hagar and Ishmael had behaved well in Abraham's family, they might have continued there; but they were justly punished. By abusing privileges, we forfeit them. Those who know not when they are well off, will be made to know the worth of mercies by the want of them. They were brought to distress in the wilderness. It is not said that the provisions were spent, or that Abraham sent them away without money. But the water was spent; and having lost their way, in that hot climate Ishmael was soon overcome with fatigue and thirst. God's readiness to help us when we are in trouble, must not slacken, but quicken our endeavours to help ourselves. The promise concerning her son is repeated, as a reason why Hagar should bestir herself to help him. It should engage our care and pains about children and young people, to consider that we know not what great use God has designed them for, and may make of them. The angel directs her to a present supply. Many who have reason to be comforted, go mourning from day to day, because they do not see the reason they have for comfort. There is a well of water near them in the covenant of grace, but they are not aware of it, till the same God that opened their eyes to see their wound, opens them to see their remedy. Paran was a wild place, fit for a wild man; such as Ishmael. Those who are born after the flesh, take up with the wilderness of this world, while the children of the promise aim at the heavenly Canaan, and cannot be at rest till they are there. Yet God was with the lad; his outward welfare was owing to this.</body></html>
