What exactly Ishmael was doing is not said, but we may dismiss all those interpretations which charge him with abominable wickedness; for had he been guilty of any such criminal conduct, the sending him away would not have been so "very grievous in Abraham's sight" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm" title="And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.">Genesis 21:11</a>). On the other hand, we may feel sure that Sarah was not without good reason for her conduct; for St. Paul bears witness that Ishmael persecuted Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-29.htm" title="But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.">Galatians 4:29</a>). The LXX. and Vulg. translate <span class= "ital">playing, sporting, </span>and Gesenius thinks that he was "dancing gracefully; "but if this were all, Sarah's jealousy would have been most unjust. When, however, we consider that Ishmael had been for fourteen years the heir, and that he now fell back into an inferior position, we cannot be surprised if at this banquet in his rival's honour he gave way to spiteful feelings, and by word and gesture derided and ridiculed him. Hagar too had probably never regarded Sarah with much affection since her forced return, and now that her son was disinherited, her bitterness would grow more intense. These jealousies are the inevitable results of polygamy; and wherever it exists, the father's life is made wretched by the intrigues of the women for their children.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Sarah saw</span> - at the feast already mentioned (Knobel, Keil); probably also on different occasions since the birth of Isaac - <span class="cmt_word">the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">ludentem cum Isaaco filio sue</span> (Vulgate), playing like a child (Aben Ezra, Knobel, Tuch, Ilgen), playing and dancing gracefully (Gesenius); but the stronger sense of the word, implying mockery, scoffing, irritating and deriding laughter (Kimchi, Vatablus, Grotius, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy), besides being admissible (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>), seems involved in the Piel form of the participle <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> (Kurtz), and is demanded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>. That Ishmael ridiculed the banquet on the occasion of Isaac's weaning (Malvenda), quarreled with him about the heirship (Fagins, Piseator), and perhaps made sport of him as a father of nations (Hengstenberg), though plausible conjectures, are not stated in the text. Ainsworth dates from this event the 400 years of Israel's oppression (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 15:13). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:9-13 Let us not overlook the manner in which this family matter instructs us not to rest in outward privileges, or in our own doings. And let us seek the blessings of the new covenant by faith in its Divine Surety. Ishmael's conduct was persecution, being done in profane contempt of the covenant and promise, and with malice against Isaac. God takes notice of what children say and do in their play; and will reckon with them, if they say or do amiss, though their parents do not. Mocking is a great sin, and very provoking to God. And the children of promise must expect to be mocked. Abraham was grieved that Ishmael should misbehave, and Sarah demand so severe a punishment. But God showed him that Isaac must be the father of the promised Seed; therefore, send Ishmael away, lest he corrupt the manners, or try to take the rights of Isaac. The covenant seed of Abraham must be a people by themselves, not mingled with those who were out of covenant: Sarah little thought of this; but God turned aright what she said.</body></html>
