The narrative, therefore, does not represent Ishmael as a small child, and the idea has probably arisen from the supposition that Abraham placed Ishmael, as well as the supply of food, on Hagar's shoulder.<span class= "bld"><p>She departed, and wandered.</span>--Her dismissal had come upon Hagar suddenly, and so she had no plan or purpose, but went hither and thither till the water in the skin was spent.<p><span class= "bld">The wilderness of Beer-sheba.</span>--As yet this region had no name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm" title="Why he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them.">Genesis 21:31</a>). It lay about twenty Roman miles or more below Hebron, and was the most southerly part of Palestine, while beyond it lay the vast desert of Et-Tih, of which the wilderness of Beer-sheba formed a part. Gerar, which place Abraham had now evidently left, was situated upon the western side of Beer-sheba, but at no great distance from it. (Seo <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm" title="And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do:">Genesis 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-26.htm" title="Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.">Genesis 26:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham rose up early in the morning</span>, - hastening to put in force the Divine instructions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8</a>, Abraham; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-8.htm">Genesis 20:8</a>, Abimelech; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>, Jacob) - <span class="cmt_word">and took bread, and a bottle of water,</span> - the bottle, from a root signifying to enclose (Furst); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), was composed of skin, the material of which the earliest carrying vessels were constructed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-19.htm">Judges 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>). "The monuments of Egypt, the sculptures of Mesopotamia, and the relics of Herculaneum and Pompeii afford ample opportunities to learn the shape and use of every variety of bottles, often surprising us both by their elegance and costliness" (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder</span>, - the usual place for carrying such vessels among Oriental women. According to Herodotus (2. 35), Egyptian women carried burdens on their shoulders, Egyptian men upon their heads - <span class="cmt_word">and the child</span>, - not placing the child, now a youth of over seventeen years, upon her shoulder (LXX., Schumann, Bohlen); <span class="cmt_word">but giving him, along with the bottle</span> (Havernick, Kalisch, A Lapide, Ainsworth), or, as well as the bread (Keil, Murphy), to Hagar, not to be carried as a burden, but led as a companion - <span class="cmt_word">and sent her away</span> - divorced her by the command of God (A Lapide); but as Hagar was never recognized by God as Abraham's wife, her sending away was not a case of divorce (Wordsworth) - and she departed (from Beersheba, whither Abraham had by this time removed, and where, in all probability, Isaac had been born), and wandered - i.e. lost her way (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-15.htm">Genesis 37:15</a>) - in the wilderness (the uncultivated waste between Palestine and Egypt) of Beersheba - introduced here by anticipation, unless the incident in Vers. 22-33 had previously taken place (<span class="accented">vide</span> on Ver. 31). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 21:15-21 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:14-21 If Hagar and Ishmael had behaved well in Abraham's family, they might have continued there; but they were justly punished. By abusing privileges, we forfeit them. Those who know not when they are well off, will be made to know the worth of mercies by the want of them. They were brought to distress in the wilderness. It is not said that the provisions were spent, or that Abraham sent them away without money. But the water was spent; and having lost their way, in that hot climate Ishmael was soon overcome with fatigue and thirst. God's readiness to help us when we are in trouble, must not slacken, but quicken our endeavours to help ourselves. The promise concerning her son is repeated, as a reason why Hagar should bestir herself to help him. It should engage our care and pains about children and young people, to consider that we know not what great use God has designed them for, and may make of them. The angel directs her to a present supply. Many who have reason to be comforted, go mourning from day to day, because they do not see the reason they have for comfort. There is a well of water near them in the covenant of grace, but they are not aware of it, till the same God that opened their eyes to see their wound, opens them to see their remedy. Paran was a wild place, fit for a wild man; such as Ishmael. Those who are born after the flesh, take up with the wilderness of this world, while the children of the promise aim at the heavenly Canaan, and cannot be at rest till they are there. Yet God was with the lad; his outward welfare was owing to this.</body></html>
