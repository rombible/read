The mirage in the desert so wearies the traveller, that at last he turns in despair from what may be more truthful signs. But after her outburst of grief, Hagar would grow more calm, and, encouraged by the angel's voice, she renews her search, and finds. As Abravanel notices, the well already existed, and was not created for Hagar's use; for God, it is said, opened her eyes, that is, enabled her to see something that indicated the existence of water: trees probably rising round the spring, or some vegetable upgrowth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God opened her eyes</span>. Not necessarily by miraculous operation; perhaps simply by providentially guiding her search for water, after the administered consolation had revived her spirit and roused her energies. And she saw a well of water, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, as distinguished from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, a pit or cistern, meant a fountain or spring of living water (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-11.htm">Genesis 24:11, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-19.htm">Genesis 26:19, 20, 21</a>). It had not been previously observed by Hagar, either because of her mental agitation (<span class="accented">dolors quasi caeca</span>. Rosenm&uuml;ller), or because, as was customary, the mouth of the well was covered - <span class="cmt_word">and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink</span> - which was certainly the first of the youth s necessities, being needful to the preservation of his life and the reviving of his spirits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:14-21 If Hagar and Ishmael had behaved well in Abraham's family, they might have continued there; but they were justly punished. By abusing privileges, we forfeit them. Those who know not when they are well off, will be made to know the worth of mercies by the want of them. They were brought to distress in the wilderness. It is not said that the provisions were spent, or that Abraham sent them away without money. But the water was spent; and having lost their way, in that hot climate Ishmael was soon overcome with fatigue and thirst. God's readiness to help us when we are in trouble, must not slacken, but quicken our endeavours to help ourselves. The promise concerning her son is repeated, as a reason why Hagar should bestir herself to help him. It should engage our care and pains about children and young people, to consider that we know not what great use God has designed them for, and may make of them. The angel directs her to a present supply. Many who have reason to be comforted, go mourning from day to day, because they do not see the reason they have for comfort. There is a well of water near them in the covenant of grace, but they are not aware of it, till the same God that opened their eyes to see their wound, opens them to see their remedy. Paran was a wild place, fit for a wild man; such as Ishmael. Those who are born after the flesh, take up with the wilderness of this world, while the children of the promise aim at the heavenly Canaan, and cannot be at rest till they are there. Yet God was with the lad; his outward welfare was owing to this.</body></html>
