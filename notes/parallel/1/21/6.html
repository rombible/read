Joy was uppermost in her mind, but women do not laugh for joy at the birth of a child. Doubtless she called to mind the feelings with which she listened to the announcement of her bearing a son, made by those whom she then regarded as mere passing wayfarers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>), but whom she had now long known to be the messengers of God. And still the event seemed to her marvellous and astonishing, so that "all that hear," she said, "will laugh with me"--Heb., <span class= "ital">for me, </span>or <span class= "ital">over me</span>--not "will ridicule me," but will be merry at the thought of an old woman of ninety having a son. Deeper feelings would come afterwards, and the acknowledgment that that which was contrary to nature was wrought by Him whom nature must obey; but surprise is uppermost in the little poem in which Sarah gives utterance to her first feelings:--<p>Who would have said unto Abraham<p>Sarah suckleth sons?<p>For I have borne a son to his old age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Sarah said,</span> - the spiritual elevation of her soul being indicated by the poetical form of her speech. Differing from Mary s magnificat in having been uttered after, and not before, the birth of the promised seed, the anthem of Sarah was obviously designed as a prelude to that loftier song of the Virgin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46</a>). It consists of two sentences, the first containing two, and the second three lines - <span class="cmt_word">God hath made me to laugh.</span> Or, retaining the order of the Hebrew, <span class="accented">To laugh hath made me Elohim</span>; the emphatic position of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;</span>, containing an allusion to the name Isaac, probably indicating that Sarah's laughter was of a different character now from what it had previously been (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>); and her ascription of it to Elohim intimating that him whom she formerly mistook for a traveler she now recognized to be Divine ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">So that</span> <span class="cmt_word">all that hear me will laugh with me.</span> Not, will laugh at me, <span class="accented">deridebit me</span> (Peele), a sense the words will bear (Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'), though in the instances adduced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-22.htm">Job 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-7.htm">Job 39:7, 18, 22</a>) <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> rather conveys the idea of despising difficulties (Kalisch); but, will laugh with me, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">congaudebit mihi</span> (LXX., Vulgate, Targums, Calvin, Dathe, Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 Few under the Old Testament were brought into the world with such expectations as Isaac. He was in this a type of Christ, that Seed which the holy God so long promised, and holy men so long expected. He was born according to the promise, at the set time of which God had spoken. God's promised mercies will certainly come at the time which He sets, and that is the best time. Isaac means laughter, and there was good reason for the name, ch. 17:17; 18:13. When the Sun of comfort is risen upon the soul, it is good to remember how welcome the dawning of the day was. When Sarah received the promise, she laughed with distrust and doubt. When God gives us the mercies we began to despair of, we ought to remember with sorrow and shame our sinful distrust of his power and promise, when we were in pursuit of them. This mercy filled Sarah with joy and wonder. God's favours to his covenant people are such as surpass their own and others' thoughts and expectations: who could imagine that he should do so much for those that deserve so little, nay, for those that deserve so ill? Who would have said that God should send his Son to die for us, his Spirit to make us holy, his angels to attend us? Who would have said that such great sins should be pardoned, such mean services accepted, and such worthless worms taken into covenant? A short account of Isaac's infancy is given. God's blessing upon the nursing of children, and the preservation of them through the perils of the infant age, are to be acknowledged as signal instances of the care and tenderness of the Divine providence. See Ps 22:9,10; Ho 11:1,2.</body></html>
