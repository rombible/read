The phrases "thy brethren" and "thy mother's sons" include all nations sprung from Abraham, and all possible offshoots from Isaac's own descendants.<p><span class= "bld">Cursed . . . and blessed.</span>--This is a special portion of the blessing given to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>); but Isaac stops short with this, and does not bestow the greater privilege that "in him should all families of the earth be blessed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm" title="And I will make your seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to your seed all these countries; and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;">Genesis 26:4</a>). The reason for this may be that it was a blessing which God must grant, and not man; or he may have had misgivings that it was more than Esau was worthy to receive; or, finally, his whole conduct being wrong, he could see and value only the earthly and lower prerogatives of the birthright. Subsequently he bestows the Abrahamic blessing upon Jacob in general terms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-4.htm" title="And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you; that you may inherit the land wherein you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.">Genesis 28:4</a>); but this, its highest privilege, is confirmed to Jacob by Jehovah Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm" title="And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let people serve thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and will serve thee</span>, <span class="accented">peoples</span>; at once a prayer and a prophecy; fulfilled in the political subjection of the Moabites, Ammonites, Syrians, Philistines, and Edomites by David; the thought being repeated in the next clause), <span class="cmt_word">and nations bow down to thee</span> (in expression of their homage): <span class="cmt_word">be lord over thy brethren</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">be a lord</span> (from the idea of power; found only here and in ver. 37) <span class="accented">to thy brethren</span>. Imminence among his kindred as well as dominion in the world is thus promised - <span class="cmt_word">and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee</span> (a repetition of the preceding thought, with perhaps a hint of his desire to humble Jacob, the favorite of Rebekah): <span class="cmt_word">cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee</span> - framed on the model of the Abrahamic benediction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>); but not so full as that, either because Isaac felt that after all Esau was not to be the progenitor of the holy seed (Murphy), or because, not being actuated by proper feelings towards Jehovah and his promises, the patriarch could not rise to that height of spiritual benediction to which he afterwards attained - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3, 4</a> (Keil), or because the prerogative of pronouncing the Abrahamic blessing in all its fullness Jehovah may have reserved to himself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a> ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 27:30-40 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:18-29 Jacob, with some difficulty, gained his point, and got the blessing. This blessing is in very general terms. No mention is made of the distinguishing mercies in the covenant with Abraham. This might be owing to Isaac having Esau in his mind, though it was Jacob who was before him. He could not be ignorant how Esau had despised the best things. Moreover, his attachment to Esau, so as to disregard the mind of God, must have greatly weakened his own faith in these things. It might therefore be expected, that leanness would attend his blessing, agreeing with the state of his mind.</body></html>
