He was now formally acknowledged as the heir of the birthright and of the promises made to Abraham, and must therefore conform to the principle laid down in his own father's case, and marry into the family of Nahor. "She sends, therefore, and calls him" to her tent, and takes secret counsel with him; and Jacob consents to take this distant journey. Thus the separation of mother and son, and long and painful travel, are the immediate result of their scheming.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah</span>: - not likely by revelation (Augustine), but by some one to whom he had made known his secret purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-11.htm">Proverbs 29:11</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and she sent and called Jacob her younger son</span> (to advise him of his danger, being apprehensive lest the passionate soul of the enraged hunter should find it difficult to delay till Isaac's death), <span class="cmt_word">and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">behold thy brother Esau taking vengeance upon thee</span> (the hithpael of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> meaning properly to comfort oneself, hence to satisfy one's feeling of revenge) by <span class="accented">killing thee</span>.

Thus he went in the way of Cain, who slew his brother, because he gained that acceptance with God of which he had rendered himself unworthy. Esau aimed to prevent Jacob or his seed from having the dominion, by taking away his life. Men may fret at God's counsels, but cannot change them. To prevent mischief, Rebekah warned Jacob of his danger, and advised him to withdraw for his safety. We must not presume too far upon the wisdom and resolution, even of the most hopeful and promising children; but care must be taken to keep them out of the way of evil. When reading this chapter, we should not fail to observe, that we must not follow even the best of men further than they act according to the law of God. We must not do evil that good may come. And though God overruled the bad actions recorded in this chapter, to fulfil his purposes, yet we see his judgment of them, in the painful consequences to all the parties concerned. It was the peculiar privilege and advantage of Jacob to convey these spiritual blessings to all nations. The Christ, the Saviour of the world, was to be born of some one family; and Jacob's was preferred to Esau's, out of the good pleasure of Almighty God, who is certainly the best judge of what is fit, and has an undoubted right to dispense his favours as he sees proper, Ro 9:12-15.</body></html>
