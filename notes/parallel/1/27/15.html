Evidently the clothing was something special, and such as was peculiar to Esau: for ordinary raiment, however handsome, would not have been kept in the mother's tent, but in that of Esau or of one of his wives.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau</span>, - literally, the <span class="accented">robes of Esau her son the elder - the desirable</span>, i.e. the handsome ones. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> was an outer garment worn by the Oriental (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12, 13, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>), - <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span>, LXX., - and was often made of beautiful and costly materials (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-10.htm">1 Kings 22:10</a>). That the clothes mentioned as belonging to Esau were sacerdotal robes possessed by him as heir of the patriarchal priesthood (Jewish Rabbis), though regarded by many as a probable conjecture (Ainsworth, Bush, Candlish, Clarke, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis), is devoid of proof, and may be pronounced unlikely, since the firstborn did not serve in the priesthood while his father lived (Willet, Alford). They were probably festive garments of the princely hunter (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">which were with her in the house,</span> - not because Esau saw that his wives were displeasing to his parents (Mercerus, Willet), or because they were sacred garments (Ainsworth, Poole), but probably because Esau, though married, had not yet quitted the patriarchal household (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and put them upon Jacob her younger son.</span> The verb, being in the hiphil, conveys the sense of causing Jacob to clothe himself, which entirely removes the impression that Jacob was a purely involuntary agent in this deceitful and deeply dishonorable affair. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:6-17 Rebekah knew that the blessing was intended for Jacob, and expected he would have it. But she wronged Isaac by putting a cheat on him; she wronged Jacob by tempting him to wickedness. She put a stumbling-block in Esau's way, and gave him a pretext for hatred to Jacob and to religion. All were to be blamed. It was one of those crooked measures often adopted to further the Divine promises; as if the end would justify, or excuse wrong means. Thus many have acted wrong, under the idea of being useful in promoting the cause of Christ. The answer to all such things is that which God addressed to Abraham, I am God Almighty; walk before me and be thou perfect. And it was a very rash speech of Rebekah, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Christ has borne the curse of the law for all who take upon them the yoke of the command, the command of the gospel. But it is too daring for any creature to say, Upon me be thy curse.</body></html>
