Its right meaning is "one who follows close upon another's heels." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm" title="And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them.">Genesis 25:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And he</span> (Esau) <span class="cmt_word">said, Is he not rightly named Jacob?</span> - literally, is <span class="accented">it that</span> one has called ha name Jacob? <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;</span> being employed when the reason is unknown (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald, 'Hebrews Syut., &sect; 324). On the meaning of Jacob cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a> - <span class="cmt_word">for</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">he hath supplanted me</span> (a paronomasia on the word Jacob) <span class="cmt_word">these two times -</span> or, already twice; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> being used adverbially in the sense of now (Gesenius, 'Grammar,' &sect; 122). The precise import of Esau's exclamation has been rendered, "Has he not been justly (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">juste</span>, Vulgate; rightly, A.V.) named Supplanter from supplanting?" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). "Is it because he was named Jacob that he hath now twice supplanted me?" (Ainsworth, Bush). "Has he received the name Jacob from the fact that he has twice outwitted me?" (Keil). "Shall he get the advantage of me because he was thus inadvertently named Jacob?" (Lange). "Has in truth his name been called Jacob?" (Kalisch). All agree in bringing out that Esau designed to indicate a correspondence between Jacob's name and Jacob's practice. <span class="cmt_word">He took away my birthright</span>; - this was scarcely correct, since Esau voluntarily sold it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-33.htm">Genesis 25:33</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing</span>. Neither was this exactly accurate, since the blessing did not originally belong to Esau, however he may have imagined that it did. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</span> The question indicates that Esau had no proper conception of the spiritual character of the blessing which his brother had obtained. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:30-40 When Esau understood that Jacob had got the blessing, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry. The day is coming, when those that now make light of the blessings of the covenant, and sell their title to spiritual blessings for that which is of no value, will, in vain, ask urgently for them. Isaac, when made sensible of the deceit practised on him, trembled exceedingly. Those who follow the choice of their own affections, rather than the Divine will, get themselves into perplexity. But he soon recovers, and confirms the blessing he had given to Jacob, saying, I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed. Those who part with their wisdom and grace, their faith and a good conscience, for the honours, wealth, or pleasures of this world, however they feign a zeal for the blessing, have judged themselves unworthy of it, and their doom shall be accordingly. A common blessing was bestowed upon Esau. This he desired. Faint desires of happiness, without right choice of the end, and right use of the means, deceive many unto their own ruin. Multitudes go to hell with their mouths full of good wishes. The great difference is, that there is nothing in Esau's blessing which points at Christ; and without that, the fatness of the earth, and the plunder of the field, will stand in little stead. Thus Isaac, by faith, blessed both his sons, according as their lot should be.</body></html>
