Plainly, he felt that he had endeavoured to do what was wrong, and was afraid lest he should still be found resisting God's will.<p><span class= "bld">Thy dwelling shall be the fatness.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">thy dwelling shall be of the fat places of the earth. </span>(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm" title="Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:">Genesis 27:28</a>.) But most modern expositors consider that the preposition should not be translated "of," but <span class= "ital">from, </span>that is:--<p>"Behold thy dwelling shall be away from the fat places of the earth,<p>And away from the dew of heaven from above,<p>And by (Heb., upon--depending upon) thy sword thou shalt live," &c.<p>By this rendering the parts of the blessing agree together. Those who have fertile lands live by agriculture, but the inhabitants of sterile regions must look to more adventurous enterprises for a living. So the Swiss, like the Greeks of old, long served as mercenaries in the armies of other states. Idumaea, though not destitute of fruitful tracts, and even famous for its orchards, was, as a whole, sterile and unproductive, and the people were restless and unquiet. Moreover, Isaac had already given the corn-land and vineyards to Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-37.htm" title="And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?">Genesis 27:37</a>), and had no second gift of them in his power. It is no answer to this to say that as the same preposition is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm" title="Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:">Genesis 27:28</a>, it cannot have a contrary sense in the two blessings. It there follows a verb of giving, and necessarily has a partitive signification. Here there is nothing absolutely to settle its meaning, and we are left to the general sense. Possibly, Isaac may have purposely used an ambiguous word; but the meaning as a whole is clear. Esau was to inhabit a land which by its barrenness would force him to a life of adventure, military service, and freebooting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaac his father</span> (moved by the tearful earnestness of Esau) <span class="cmt_word">answered and said unto him</span>, - still speaking under inspiration, though it is doubtful whether what he spoke was a real, or only an apparent, blessing - (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">infra</span>) <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">from</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>) <span class="accented">the fatnesses</span> (or fat places) <span class="accented">of the earth</span>, <span class="accented">and from the dew of area</span>; a substantial repetition of the temporal blessing bestowed on Jacob (ver. 28), with certain important variations, such as the omission of plenty of corn and wine at the close, and of the name of Elohim at the commencement, of the benediction (Vulgate, Luther, Calvin, Ainsworth, Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'); though, by assigning to the preposition a privative rather than a partitive sense, it is readily transformed into "a modified curse" - behold, <span class="accented">away from the fatnesses o/the earth</span>, etc., <span class="accented">shall thy dwelling be</span>, meaning that, in contrast to the land of Canaan, the descendants of Esau should be located in a sterile region (Tuch, Knobel, Kurtz, Delitzseh, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy). In support of this latter rendering it is urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is grammatically admissible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it corresponds with the present aspect of Idumaea, which is "on the whole a dreary and unproductive land;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it agrees with the preceding statement that every blessing had already been bestowed upon Jacob; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it explains the play upon the words "fatness" and "dew," which are here chosen to describe a state of matter exactly the opposite to that which was declared to be the lot of Jacob. On the other hand, it is felt to be somewhat arbitrary to assign to the preposition a partitive sense in ver. 28 and a privative in ver. 39. Though called in later times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>) a waste and desolate region, it may not have been originally so, or only in comparison with Canaan; while according to modern travelers the glens and mountain terraces of Edom, covered with rich soil, only want an industrious population to convert the entire region into "one of the wealthiest, as it is one of the most picturesque, countries in the world." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:30-40 When Esau understood that Jacob had got the blessing, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry. The day is coming, when those that now make light of the blessings of the covenant, and sell their title to spiritual blessings for that which is of no value, will, in vain, ask urgently for them. Isaac, when made sensible of the deceit practised on him, trembled exceedingly. Those who follow the choice of their own affections, rather than the Divine will, get themselves into perplexity. But he soon recovers, and confirms the blessing he had given to Jacob, saying, I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed. Those who part with their wisdom and grace, their faith and a good conscience, for the honours, wealth, or pleasures of this world, however they feign a zeal for the blessing, have judged themselves unworthy of it, and their doom shall be accordingly. A common blessing was bestowed upon Esau. This he desired. Faint desires of happiness, without right choice of the end, and right use of the means, deceive many unto their own ruin. Multitudes go to hell with their mouths full of good wishes. The great difference is, that there is nothing in Esau's blessing which points at Christ; and without that, the fatness of the earth, and the plunder of the field, will stand in little stead. Thus Isaac, by faith, blessed both his sons, according as their lot should be.</body></html>
