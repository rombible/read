but he recovered, and lived for more than half a century. Perhaps on this account another translation has been suggested, namely, "Days of mourning for my father are at hand: for I will slay Jacob." But there is no support for this in the Hebrew, and it represents Esau as utterly inhuman; whereas, with all his faults, he had a warm, loving heart. Genesis 28 ought to have begun here, as the break at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-46.htm" title="And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?">Genesis 27:46</a> is very injurious to the meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Esau hated Jacob</span> - a proof that he was not penitent, however disappointed and remorseful (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12, 15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him</span>: - notwithstanding the fact that he too had received an appropriate benediction; a display of envy as well as wrath, another proof of his ungracious character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-21.htm">Galatians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-5.htm">James 4:5</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and Esau said in his heart,</span> - i.e. secretly resolved, though afterwards he must have communicated his intention (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 42) - <span class="cmt_word">The days of mourning for my father are at hand.</span> The LXX. interpret as a wish on the part of Esau that Isaac might speedily die, in order that the fratricidal act he contemplated might not pain the old man's heart; another rendering (Kalisch) understands him to say that days of grief were in store for his father, as he meant to slay his brother; but the ordinary translation seems preferable (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), that Esan only deferred the execution of his unholy purpose because of the near approach, as he imagined, of his father's death. Isaac, however, lived upwards of forty years after this. <span class="cmt_word">Then will I slay my brother Jacob</span>. That which reconciled Isaac and Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9</a>), the death of a father, is here mentioned as the event which would decisively and finally part Esau and Jacob. Esau's murderous intention Calvin regards as a clear proof of the non-reality of his repentance for his sin, the insincerity of his sorrow for his father, and the intense malignity of his hate against his brother. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:41-46 Esau bore malice to Jacob on account of the blessing he had obtained. Thus he went in the way of Cain, who slew his brother, because he gained that acceptance with God of which he had rendered himself unworthy. Esau aimed to prevent Jacob or his seed from having the dominion, by taking away his life. Men may fret at God's counsels, but cannot change them. To prevent mischief, Rebekah warned Jacob of his danger, and advised him to withdraw for his safety. We must not presume too far upon the wisdom and resolution, even of the most hopeful and promising children; but care must be taken to keep them out of the way of evil. When reading this chapter, we should not fail to observe, that we must not follow even the best of men further than they act according to the law of God. We must not do evil that good may come. And though God overruled the bad actions recorded in this chapter, to fulfil his purposes, yet we see his judgment of them, in the painful consequences to all the parties concerned. It was the peculiar privilege and advantage of Jacob to convey these spiritual blessings to all nations. The Christ, the Saviour of the world, was to be born of some one family; and Jacob's was preferred to Esau's, out of the good pleasure of Almighty God, who is certainly the best judge of what is fit, and has an undoubted right to dispense his favours as he sees proper, Ro 9:12-15.</body></html>
