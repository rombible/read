In the previous five verses we had the general results of Rebekah's guile: we have now the special consequence of Jacob's departure for Haran. Upon Rebekah's communication to Isaac follows his decision in the next chapter. In the Hebrew there is no break from the beginning of Genesis 27 to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-9.htm" title="Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loves:">Genesis 27:9</a> of Genesis 28.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rebekah said to Isaac</span> (perhaps already discerning in the contemplated flight to Haran the prospect of a suitable matrimonial alliance for the heir of the promise, and secretly desiring to suggest such a thought to her aged husband), <span class="cmt_word">I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth:</span> - referring doubtless to Esau's wives (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-35.htm">Genesis 26:35</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?</span> Literally, <span class="accented">for what to me life</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. what happiness can I have in living? It is impossible to exonerate Rebekah altogether from a charge of duplicity even in this. Unquestionably Esau s wives may have vexed her, and her faith may have perceived that Jacob's wife must be sought for amongst their own kindred; but her secret reason for sending Jacob to Haran was not to seek a wife, as she seems to have desired Isaac to believe, but to elude the fury of his incensed brother. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:41-46 Esau bore malice to Jacob on account of the blessing he had obtained. Thus he went in the way of Cain, who slew his brother, because he gained that acceptance with God of which he had rendered himself unworthy. Esau aimed to prevent Jacob or his seed from having the dominion, by taking away his life. Men may fret at God's counsels, but cannot change them. To prevent mischief, Rebekah warned Jacob of his danger, and advised him to withdraw for his safety. We must not presume too far upon the wisdom and resolution, even of the most hopeful and promising children; but care must be taken to keep them out of the way of evil. When reading this chapter, we should not fail to observe, that we must not follow even the best of men further than they act according to the law of God. We must not do evil that good may come. And though God overruled the bad actions recorded in this chapter, to fulfil his purposes, yet we see his judgment of them, in the painful consequences to all the parties concerned. It was the peculiar privilege and advantage of Jacob to convey these spiritual blessings to all nations. The Christ, the Saviour of the world, was to be born of some one family; and Jacob's was preferred to Esau's, out of the good pleasure of Almighty God, who is certainly the best judge of what is fit, and has an undoubted right to dispense his favours as he sees proper, Ro 9:12-15.</body></html>
