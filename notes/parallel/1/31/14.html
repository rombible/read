Kalisch obviously regards it as preposterous that Rachel and Leah should have expected anything, since "married daughters in the East never had any such claim where there were sons." But Laban had not treated Jacob's wives even as daughters. <span class="cmt_word">Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us</span> (however much they loved Jacob they could not but resent the mercenary meanness of Laban, by which they, the free-born daughters of a chieftain, had been sold as common serfs), <span class="cmt_word">and hath quits devoured also our money</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and hath eaten up</span>, <span class="accented">yes</span>, <span class="accented">even eating up</span>, <span class="accented">our money</span>, the inf. abs., <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, after the finite verb, expressing the continuance (Keil) and intensity (Kalisch) of the action (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald, 'Hebrews Synt.,' &sect; 280). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is by some interpreters rendered but (Jarchi), so that (Keil), indeed (Kalisch), though there is no sufficient reason for departing from the usual meaning "for" (Rosenm&uuml;ller) - <span class="cmt_word">all the riches which God hath taken from our father,</span> - thus Rachel and Leah also recognize the hand of God (Elohim) in Jacob's unusual prosperity - <span class="cmt_word">that is ours, and our children's</span> (Rachel and Leah mean to say that what Jacob had acquired by his six years of service with their father was no more than would have naturally belonged to him had they obtained their portions at the first): <span class="cmt_word">now then, Whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do</span>. It is clear that, equally with himself, they were prepared for breaking off connection with their father Laban. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-21 The affairs of these families are related very minutely, while (what are called) the great events of states and kingdoms at that period, are not mentioned. The Bible teaches people the common duties of life, how to serve God, how to enjoy the blessings he bestows, and to do good in the various stations and duties of life. Selfish men consider themselves robbed of all that goes past them, and covetousness will even swallow up natural affection. Men's overvaluing worldly wealth is that error which is the root of covetousness, envy, and all evil. The men of the world stand in each other's way, and every one seems to be taking away from the rest; hence discontent, envy, and discord. But there are possessions that will suffice for all; happy they who seek them in the first place. In all our removals we should have respect to the command and promise of God. If He be with us, we need not fear. The perils which surround us are so many, that nothing else can really encourage our hearts. To remember favoured seasons of communion with God, is very refreshing when in difficulties; and we should often recollect our vows, that we fail not to fulfil them.</body></html>
