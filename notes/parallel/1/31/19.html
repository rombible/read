Why let the young men find favor in your eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray you, whatever comes to your hand to your servants, and to your son David.">1Samuel 25:8</a> ). Laban's flocks, apparently, were also at some distance from Haran, and his sons and men-servants would all be with him, busily occupied in the work. Apparently, too, Laban's wealth was not seriously diminished, though it had not of late increased; and his repeated change of the hire proves that he was quite able to take care of himself. But why was not Jacob present, as he had chief charge of Laban's flocks? Possibly, he was expected there, and was missed; but, more probably, as the result of the growing estrangement between them, caused by the too rapid increase of Jacob's riches, Laban and his sons had gradually taken the management of their flocks into their own hands.<p><span class= "bld">Images.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">teraphim, </span>called Laban's gods in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm" title="And now, though you would needs be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?">Genesis 31:30</a>, and we find that their worship continued throughout the Old Testament history. Micah sets up teraphim, as well as a molten and a graven image, and an ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-17.htm" title="And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.">Judges 18:17</a>). Though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.">1Samuel 15:23</a>, where the Authorised Version has <span class= "ital">idolatry, </span>teraphim are spoken of in strong terms of condemnation, yet Michal possessed them, and placed them in David's bed. We gather from this that they had a head shaped like that of a man, but, probably, a dwarf trunk, as she seems to have put more than one in the bed to represent David's body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.">1Samuel 19:13</a>). So, too, here Rachel hides them under the camel's furniture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-34.htm" title="Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.">Genesis 31:34</a>), which proves that they, in this case, were of no great size. In the history of the thorough reformation carried out by King Josiah we find the mention of teraphim among the things put away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm" title="Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.">2Kings 23:24</a>). We learn, nevertheless, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm" title="For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.">Zechariah 10:2</a>, that they were still used for divination; and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a> that both pillars and teraphim had long been objects of ordinary superstition among the ten tribes. As Nebuchadnezzar divines by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a>) they were possibly of Chaldean origin; and, probably, were not so much worshipped as used for consultation. Women seem to have been most given to their service, and probably regarded them as charms, and told fortunes by them; and here Rachel stole them upon the supposition that they would bring prosperity to her and her husband.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban went</span> - or, Now Laban had gone, probably to the other station, which was three days journey from Jacob's flocks (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-22.htm">Genesis 31:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to shear his sheep</span>.

Whether Jacob's absence from the festivities is to be explained by the dissension existing between him and Laban, which either caused him to be uninvited or led him to decline the invitation (Kurtz), or by the supposition that he had first gone and subsequently left the banquet (Lange), the fact that Laban was so engaged afforded Jacob the opportunity he desired for making his escape. <span class="cmt_word">And Rachel had stolen</span> (or, "<span class="accented">and</span> Rachel <span class="accented">stole</span>," availing herself likewise of the opportunity presented by her father's absence) <span class="cmt_word">the images that were her father's.</span> The teraphim, from an unused root, <span class="accented">taraph</span>, signifying to live comfortably, like the Sanscrit <span class="accented">trip</span>, Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, Arabic tarafa (Gesenius, Furst, <span class="accented">sub voces</span>), appear to have been small human figures (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-34.htm">Genesis 31:34</a>), though the image in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a> must have been nearly life-size, or at least a full-sized bust, sometimes made of silver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4</a>), though commonly constructed of wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13-16</a>); they were worshipped as gods (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">vide</span>, Vulgate, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm">Genesis 31:30</a>), consulted for oracles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>), and believed to be the custodians and promoters of human happiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-24.htm">Judges 18:24</a>). Probably derived from the Aramaeans (Furst, Kurtz), or the Chaldeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>, Kalisch, Wordsworth), the worship of teraphim was subsequently denounced as idolatrous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-24.htm">2 Kings 13:24</a>). Cf. with Rachel's act that ascribed to AEneas: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Effigies sacrae divum, Phrygiique Penates,<br />Quos mecum a Troja, mediisque ex ignibus urbis,"<br />Extuleram"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Virg., 'AEn.,' 3. 148-150</span>). Rachel's motive for abstracting her father's teraphim has been variously ascribed to a desire to prevent her father from discovering, by inquiring at his gods, the direction of their flight (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller), to protect herself, in case, of being overtaken, by an appeal to her father s gods (Josephus), to draw her father from the practice of idolatry (Bazil, Gregory, Nazisnzen, Theodoret), to obtain children for herself through their assistance (Lengerke, Gerlach), to preserve a memorial of her ancestors, whose pictures these teraphim were (Lightfoot); but was probably due to avarice, if the images were made of precious metals (Pererius), or to a taint of superstition which still adhered to her otherwise religious nature (Chrysostom, Calvin, 'Speaker's Commentary ), causing her to look to these idols for protection (Kalisch, Murphy) or consultation (Wordsworth) on her journey. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-21 The affairs of these families are related very minutely, while (what are called) the great events of states and kingdoms at that period, are not mentioned. The Bible teaches people the common duties of life, how to serve God, how to enjoy the blessings he bestows, and to do good in the various stations and duties of life. Selfish men consider themselves robbed of all that goes past them, and covetousness will even swallow up natural affection. Men's overvaluing worldly wealth is that error which is the root of covetousness, envy, and all evil. The men of the world stand in each other's way, and every one seems to be taking away from the rest; hence discontent, envy, and discord. But there are possessions that will suffice for all; happy they who seek them in the first place. In all our removals we should have respect to the command and promise of God. If He be with us, we need not fear. The perils which surround us are so many, that nothing else can really encourage our hearts. To remember favoured seasons of communion with God, is very refreshing when in difficulties; and we should often recollect our vows, that we fail not to fulfil them.</body></html>
