<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and with harp</span>!

It is perhaps judging Laban too severely to pronounce this complete hypocrisy and cant (Alford, Bush, Candlish, Gerlach), but equally wide of the truth is it to see in Laban's conduct nothing but generosity of feeling (Kalisch); probably there was a mixture of both paternal affection and crafty dissimulation (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</span> The charge of folly in Old Testament Scriptures commonly carries with it an imputation of wrong-doing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-10.htm">2 Samuel 14:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It is in the power of my hand</span> - so the phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-32.htm">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>) is rendered by competent authorities (Gesenius, Furst, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Murphy, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), with which agree laxly, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX.), and <span class="accented">valet manus men</span> (Vulgate), though the translation "My hand is for God," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my hand serves me as God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>), is by some preferred (Keil, Knobel, Jacobus) - <span class="cmt_word">to do you hurt: but the God of your father</span> - the use of this expression can be rightly regarded neither as a proof of Elohistic authorship (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Davidson) nor as a sign of Laban's spiritual degeneracy (Hengstenberg, Wordsworth), since it is practically equivalent to Jehovah (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>), but is probably to be viewed as a play upon the sound and sense of the preceding clause, as thus: - "It is in the El of my hand to do you evil, but the Elohim of your father spake to me." Another instance of this play upon the sound and sense is to be found in vers. 19, 20 - "Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's; and Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Syrian" (cf. Quarry on Genesis, p. 498) - <span class="cmt_word">spake unto me yester night, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob</span> - literally, <span class="accented">guard or keep thee for thyself</span> (the pleon, pron. being added <span class="accented">ut supra</span>, ver. 24) <span class="accented">from speaking with Jacob - <span class="cmt_word"></span>either good or bad</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone</span> (literally, <span class="accented">going thou didst go -</span> thou hast indeed gone), <span class="cmt_word">because thou sore longedst after thy father's house</span> (literally, <span class="accented">because desiring thou didst desire</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">to be pale</span> (whence <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, silver, so called from its pale color), expresses the idea of pining away and languishing through strong inward longing), <span class="cmt_word">yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?</span> Laban had probably gone to consult his teraphim and so discovered their loss. Augustine calls attention to this as the first Scripture reference to heathen gods, and Calvin probably supplies the right explanation of the sense in which they were so styled by Laban, <span class="accented">non quia deitatem illie putaret esse inclusam</span>, <span class="accented">sed quia in honorem deorum imagines illas colebat</span>; <span class="accented">vel potius quod Deo sacra facturus</span>, <span class="accented">vertebat se ad illas imagines</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>). "This complaint of Laban, that his "gods were stolen, show-eth the vanity of such idolatry" (Ainsworth). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-31.htm">Judges 6:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-24.htm">Judges 16:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5, 11, 15</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:22-35 God can put a bridle in the mouth of wicked men, to restrain their malice, though he do not change their hearts. Though they have no love to God's people, they will pretend to it, and try to make a merit of necessity. Foolish Laban! to call those things his gods which could be stolen! Enemies may steal our goods, but not our God. Here Laban lays to Jacob's charge things that he knew not. Those who commit their cause to God, are not forbidden to plead it themselves with meekness and fear. When we read of Rachel's stealing her father's images, what a scene of iniquity opens! The family of Nahor, who left the idolatrous Chaldees; is this family itself become idolatrous? It is even so. The truth seems to be, that they were like some in after-times, who sware by the Lord and by Malcham, Zep 1:5; and like others in our times, who wish to serve both God and mammon. Great numbers will acknowledge the true God in words, but their hearts and houses are the abodes of spiritual idolatry. When a man gives himself up to covetousness, like Laban, the world is his god; and he has only to reside among gross idolaters in order to become one, or at least a favourer of their abominations.</body></html>
