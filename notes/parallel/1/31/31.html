Accordingly, the import of his words has been mollified by regarding them simply as a prediction, "he will not live," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he will die before his time (Jonathan), a prediction which, the Rabbins note, was fulfilled in Rachel (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16, 18</a>); or by connecting them with clause following, "he will not live before our brethren," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. let him be henceforth cut off from the society of his kinsmen (LXX., Bush).

Though they have no love to God's people, they will pretend to it, and try to make a merit of necessity. Foolish Laban! to call those things his gods which could be stolen! Enemies may steal our goods, but not our God. Here Laban lays to Jacob's charge things that he knew not. Those who commit their cause to God, are not forbidden to plead it themselves with meekness and fear. When we read of Rachel's stealing her father's images, what a scene of iniquity opens! The family of Nahor, who left the idolatrous Chaldees; is this family itself become idolatrous? It is even so. The truth seems to be, that they were like some in after-times, who sware by the Lord and by Malcham, Zep 1:5; and like others in our times, who wish to serve both God and mammon. Great numbers will acknowledge the true God in words, but their hearts and houses are the abodes of spiritual idolatry. When a man gives himself up to covetousness, like Laban, the world is his god; and he has only to reside among gross idolaters in order to become one, or at least a favourer of their abominations.</body></html>
