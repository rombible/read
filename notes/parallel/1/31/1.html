In saying that Jacob had taken "all that was their father's" they were guilty of exaggeration; for Laban was still rich, and probably, upon the whole, was a gainer by the presence of one so highly gifted as Jacob. Their word "glory" suggests that, enriched by cattle and commerce, Jacob had now become a person of great importance in the eyes of the people of Haran.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - Jacob had now served twenty years with Laban, and must accordingly have been in his ninety-seventh or seventy-seventh year (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">heard the words of Laban's sons</span>, - who were not at this time only small youths about fourteen years of ago (Delitzsch), since they were capable of being entrusted with their father's flocks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">saying</span> (probably in a conversation which had been over. heard by Jacob), <span class="cmt_word">Jacob hath taken away</span> (by fraud is what they meant, an opinion in which Kalisch agrees; but it is not quite certain that Jacob was guilty of dishonesty in acting as he did) <span class="cmt_word">all that was our father's</span>; - this was a manifest exaggeration; <span class="accented">sed hoe morbo laborant sordidi et nimium tenaces</span>, <span class="accented">ut sibi ereptum esse putent quicquid non ingurgitant</span> (Calvin) - <span class="cmt_word">and of that which was our father's hath he gotten</span> (literally, made, in the sense of acquiring, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>) <span class="cmt_word">all this glory</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, to be heavy, hence to be great in the sense of honored, and also to be abundant) signifies either glory, splendor, renown, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-21.htm">Job 14:21</a>; or, what seems the preferable meaning here, wealth, riches, <span class="accented">facultates</span> (Vulgate), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10</a>.

The Bible teaches people the common duties of life, how to serve God, how to enjoy the blessings he bestows, and to do good in the various stations and duties of life. Selfish men consider themselves robbed of all that goes past them, and covetousness will even swallow up natural affection. Men's overvaluing worldly wealth is that error which is the root of covetousness, envy, and all evil. The men of the world stand in each other's way, and every one seems to be taking away from the rest; hence discontent, envy, and discord. But there are possessions that will suffice for all; happy they who seek them in the first place. In all our removals we should have respect to the command and promise of God. If He be with us, we need not fear. The perils which surround us are so many, that nothing else can really encourage our hearts. To remember favoured seasons of communion with God, is very refreshing when in difficulties; and we should often recollect our vows, that we fail not to fulfil them.</body></html>
