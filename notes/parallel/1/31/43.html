Why should he wish to injure Jacob, and send him away empty? All that he had was still Laban's in the best of senses; for were not Rachel and Leah his daughters? And were not their children his grandsons? How was it possible that he could wish to rob them? He proposes, therefore, that they should make a covenant, by which Jacob should bind himself to deal kindly with his daughters, and to take no other wife; while he promises for himself that he would do Jacob no wrong. Jacob therefore sets up a large stone, as a pillar and memorial; and Laban subsequently does the same; while, probably between the two hills on which they had severally encamped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-25.htm" title="Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brothers pitched in the mount of Gilead.">Genesis 31:25</a>), they collect a large mass of other stones, on which they feast together, in token of friendship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-30.htm" title="And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.">Genesis 26:30</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43, 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban answered and said unto Jacob</span>, - neither receiving Jacob's torrent of invective with affected meekness (Candlish), nor proving himself to be completely reformed by the angry recriminations of his "callous and hardened son-in-law (Kalisch); but perhaps simply owning the truth of Jacob's wants, and recognizing that he had no just ground of complaint (Calvin), as well as touched in his paternal affections by the sight of his daughters, from whom he felt that he was about to part for ever. <span class="cmt_word">These daughters</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the daughters</span> (there) - <span class="cmt_word">are my daughters, and these</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">children are my children, and these</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">cattle are my cattle; and all that thou seest is mine</span>.

He is not willing to own himself in fault, as he ought to have done. But he proposes a covenant of friendship between them, to which Jacob readily agrees. A heap of stones was raised, to keep up the memory of the event, writing being then not known or little used. A sacrifice of peace offerings was offered. Peace with God puts true comfort into our peace with our friends. They did eat bread together, partaking of the feast upon the sacrifice. In ancient times covenants of friendship were ratified by the parties eating and drinking together. God is judge between contending parties, and he will judge righteously; whoever do wrong, it is at their peril. They gave a new name to the place, The heap of witness. After this angry parley, they part friends. God is often better to us than our fears, and overrules the spirits of men in our favour, beyond what we could have expected; for it is not in vain to trust in him.</body></html>
