The stony character of the regon may have suggested the designation. <span class="cmt_word">And Mizpah</span>; - watchtower from Tsaphah, to watch. Mizpah afterwards became the site of a town in the district of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11, 19, 34</a>); which received its name, as the historian intimates, from the pile of witness erected by Laban and his kinsmen, and was later celebrated as the residence of Jephthah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>) and the seat of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>). Ewald supposes that the mound (Galeed) and the watch tower (Mispah) were different objects, and that the meaning of the (so-called) legend is that, while the former (the mountain) was riled up by Jacob and his people, the latter (now the city and fortress of Mizpah on one of the heights of Gilead) was constructed by Laban and his followers (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'History of Israel,' vol. 1. p. 347); but the "<span class="accented">grotesqusnesa"</span> of this interpretation of the Hebrew story is its best refutation - <span class="cmt_word">for he</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Laban) <span class="cmt_word">said, The Lord</span> - Jehovah; a proof that vers. 49, 50 are a Jehovistic interpolation (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Kalisch); an indication of their being a subsequent insertion, though not warranting the inference that the entire history is a complication (Keil); a sign that henceforth Laban regarded Jehovah as the representative of his rights (Lange); but probably only a token that Laban, recognizing Jehovah as the only name that would bind the conscience of Jacob (Hengstenberg, Quarry), had for the moment adopted Jacob's theology ('Speaker's Commentary'), but only in self-defense (Wordsworth) - <span class="cmt_word">watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another</span> - literally, <span class="accented">a man from his companion</span>. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters (Laban's concern for his daughters, though hitherto not conspicuous, may, in the hour of parting from them, have been real: his language shows that he was not quite at ease as to Jacob's integrity. Perhaps the remembrance that he had been the cause of Jacob's taking two wives made him anxious to secure that Jacob should not improve upon his evil instructions), <span class="cmt_word">no man is with us</span>; - either then they stood apart from Laban's clan followers (Inglis); or his meaning was that when widely separated there would be no one to judge betwixt them, or perhaps even to observe them (Rosenm&uuml;ller), <span class="cmt_word">but</span> - see, God (Elohim in contrast to man) <span class="cmt_word">is witness betwixt me and thee.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers 51-53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban said to Jacob,</span> - according to Ewald the last narrator has transposed the names of Laban and Jacob (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'History of Israel,' vol. 1. p. 346) - <span class="cmt_word">Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast</span> (same word as in ver. 45. The Arabic version and Samaritan text read <span class="accented">yaritha</span>, thou hast erected, instead of <span class="accented">yarithi</span>, I have erected or cast up) <span class="cmt_word">betwixt me and thee; this heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that</span> (literally, if, here = <span class="accented">that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar</span> (Laban bound himself never to pass over the heap which he had erected as his witness; whereas Jacob was required to swear that he would never cross the pillar and the pile, both of which were witnesses for him) <span class="cmt_word">unto me, for harm</span>. The emphatic word closes the sentence. <span class="cmt_word">The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge</span> - the verb is plural, either because Laban regarded the Elohim of Nahor as different from the Elohim of Abraham (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary'), or because, though acknowledging only one Elohim, he viewed him as maintaining several and distinct relations to the persons named (cf. Quarry, p. 499) - <span class="cmt_word">betwixt us.</span> Laban here invokes his own hereditary Elohim, the Elohim of Abraham's father, to guard his rights and interests under the newly-formed covenant; while Jacob in his adjuration appeals to the Elohim of Abraham's son. <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">supra</span>, <span class="accented">ver</span>. 42). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:43-55 Laban could neither justify himself nor condemn Jacob, therefore desires to hear no more of that matter. He is not willing to own himself in fault, as he ought to have done. But he proposes a covenant of friendship between them, to which Jacob readily agrees. A heap of stones was raised, to keep up the memory of the event, writing being then not known or little used. A sacrifice of peace offerings was offered. Peace with God puts true comfort into our peace with our friends. They did eat bread together, partaking of the feast upon the sacrifice. In ancient times covenants of friendship were ratified by the parties eating and drinking together. God is judge between contending parties, and he will judge righteously; whoever do wrong, it is at their peril. They gave a new name to the place, The heap of witness. After this angry parley, they part friends. God is often better to us than our fears, and overrules the spirits of men in our favour, beyond what we could have expected; for it is not in vain to trust in him.</body></html>
