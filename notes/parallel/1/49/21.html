Naphtali, on the contrary, is light and active, moving rapidly like "a hind let loose;" or, literally, <span class= "ital">sent forth, </span>like the scouts or van of an army. And thus he brings back "goodly words"--Heb., <span class= "ital">words of pleasure</span>--that is, trustworthy intelligence to guide the army in its motions. Another translation has been proposed, which has the support of the LXX.: "Naphtali is a spreading terebinth, which shoots forth goodly branches." It retains the consonants of the Hebrew text, but gives them different vowels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Naphtaii is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</span> The LXX., followed by Dathe, Michaelis, Ewald, Bohlen, and others, read, Naphtali is a tall terebinth, that putteth forth beautiful boughs; but the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> signifies a hind or gazelle, and is here employed, along with the qualifying epithet <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, let loose, running freely (Keil), or graceful (Kalisch), to depict Naphtali as a beautiful and agile warrior. In the appended clause he is represented as possessing in addition the capacity of "giving words of beauty," in which may be detected an allusion to the development in eloquence and song which afterwards took place in that northern tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-1.htm">Judges 5:1-31</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:19-21 Concerning Gad, Jacob alludes to his name, which signifies a troop, and foresees the character of that tribe. The cause of God and his people, though for a time it may seem to be baffled and run down, will be victorious at last. It represents the Christian's conflict. Grace in the soul is often foiled in its conflicts; troops of corruption overcome it, but the cause is God's, and grace will in the end come off conqueror, yea, more than conqueror, Ro 8:37. Asher should be a rich tribe. His inheritance bordered upon Carmel, which was fruitful to a proverb. Naphtali, is a hind let loose. We may consider it as a description of the character of this tribe. Unlike the laborious ox and ass; desirous of ease and liberty; active, but more noted for quick despatch than steady labour and perseverance. Like the suppliant who, with goodly words, craves mercy. Let not those of different tempers and gifts censure or envy one another.</body></html>
