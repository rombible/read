Thus, then, "A troop" or "throng of plunderers shall throng upon him, but he shall throng upon their heel."

The language refers to attacks of nomadic tribes which would harass and annoy the Gadites, but which they would successfully repel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:19-21 Concerning Gad, Jacob alludes to his name, which signifies a troop, and foresees the character of that tribe. The cause of God and his people, though for a time it may seem to be baffled and run down, will be victorious at last. It represents the Christian's conflict. Grace in the soul is often foiled in its conflicts; troops of corruption overcome it, but the cause is God's, and grace will in the end come off conqueror, yea, more than conqueror, Ro 8:37. Asher should be a rich tribe. His inheritance bordered upon Carmel, which was fruitful to a proverb. Naphtali, is a hind let loose. We may consider it as a description of the character of this tribe. Unlike the laborious ox and ass; desirous of ease and liberty; active, but more noted for quick despatch than steady labour and perseverance. Like the suppliant who, with goodly words, craves mercy. Let not those of different tempers and gifts censure or envy one another.</body></html>
