The effect of the picture is also heightened by the alternative image of a lioness, which is particularly fierce in defending its cubs, and which no one would venture to assail when so employed. The use of such figures to describe a strong and invincible hero is by no means infrequent in Scripture (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2-9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The scepter shall not depart from Judah,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">a scepter</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> an emblem of regal command, hence dominion or sovereignty; <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX., Theodotion; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, Symmachus) <span class="accented">shall not depart from Judah - <span class="cmt_word"></span>nor a lawgiver from between his feet</span> - literally, and <span class="accented">a legislator</span> (sc. shall not depart)from <span class="accented">between his feet</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>, the poel part of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, to cut, to cut into, hence to decree, to ordain, having the sense of one who decrees; hence leader, as in Judges 5:44, <span class="accented">dux</span> (Vulgate), <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), or lawgiver, as m <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-21.htm">Deuteronomy 33:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a> (Calvin, Dathius, Ainsworth, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary'). In view, however, of what appears the requirement of the parallelism, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> is regarded as not the person, but the thing, that determines or rules, and hence as equivalent to the ruler's staff, or marshal's baton (Gesenius, Furst, Keil, Lange, Bleek, Tuch, Kalisch, and others), in support of which is claimed the phrase "from between his feet," which is supposed to point to the Oriental custom, as depicted on the monuments, of monarchs, when sitting upon their thrones, resting their staves between their feet (cf. Agamemnon, 'Iliad,' 2:46, 101; Layard s 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 195). But the words may likewise signify "from among his descendants," "from among his children's children" (Onkelos), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">Until Shiloh come</span>. This difficult clause has been very variously rendered. 1. Taking Shiloh as the name of a place, viz., Shiloh in Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1, 8, 9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-51.htm">Joshua 19:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3, 9, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a>, etc.), the sense has been explained as meaning that the leadership of Judah over the other tribes of Israel should not cease until he came to Shiloh (Rabbi Lipmann, Teller, Eichhorn, Bleek, Furst, Tuch, Delitzsch). But though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, and they came to Shiloh, a similar phrase, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>, yet against this interpretation maybe urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the improbability of so obscure a locality, whose existence at the time is also problematical, being mentioned by Jacob, Zidon, the only other name occurring in the prophecy, having been, even before the days of Jacob, a city of renown (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the inaccuracy of the historical statement which would thus be made, since the supremacy of Judah was in no way affected, and certainly not diminished, by the setting up of the tabernacle in Shiloh; to obviate which objection Kalisch proposes to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> "<span class="accented">even if</span>," or "even when," and to understand the prediction as intimating that even though a new empire should be established at Shiloh, as was eventually done, Judah should not forfeit her royal name and prerogative - only this sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is not clearly recognized by the best grammarians (Gesenius, Furst), and is not successfully supported by the passages referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-8.htm">Psalm 112:8</a>), in every one of which the received rendering "until" is distinctly preferable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Regarding Shiloh as an abstract noun, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to be safe, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the import of the prophecy has been expressed as asserting that the scepter should not depart from Judah, either until he (Judah) should attain to rest (Hofmann, Kurtz), or until tranquility should come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> until Judah s enemies should be subdued (Gesenius), an interpretation which Rosenm&uuml;ller properly characterises as "<span class="accented">languidum et paine frigidum</span>." Hence - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Believing Shiloh to be the name of a person, the majority of commentators, both Jewish and Christian, and ancient as well as modern, agree that the Messiah is the person referred to, and understand Jacob as fore-announcing that the time of his appearance would not be till the staff of regal power had dropped from the hands of Judah; only, the widest possible diversity exists among those who discover a Messianic reference in the prediction as to the exact significance of the term Shiloh. Some render it his son, or progeny, or (great) descendant, from an imaginary root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, which, after Chaldee and Arabic analogies, is supposed to mean "offspring" (Targum of Jonathan, Kimchi, Calvin, Ainsworth, and others); others, deriving it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, to send, compare it with Siloam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>) and Shiloah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a>), and interpret it as <span class="accented">qui mittendus eat</span> (Vulgate, Pererius, A Lapide, Grotius); a third class of expositors, connecting it with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to be safe or at rest, view it us a <span class="accented">nomen appellatum</span>, signifying the Pacificator, the Rest-giver, the Tranquillizer, the Peace (Luther, Venema, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, Keil, Gerlach, Murphy, etc.); while a fourth resolve it into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, and conjecture it to signify, he to whom it (<span class="accented">sc</span>. the scepter or the kingdom) belongs, or he whose right it is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>; Aquila and Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; Onkelos, Syriac, Saadias, Targum of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">alii</span>). It seems indisputable that the preponderance of authority is in favor of the last two interpretations, and if <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;</span> be the correct reading, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;</span> (  =  <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;</span>   =  <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>), as the majority of MSS. attest, it will be difficult to withhold from the former, "the Tranquillizer," the palm of superiority. The translations of Dathius (<span class="accented">quamdiu prolem habebit, ei genres obedient</span>), who professes to follow Guleher, who understands the words as a prophecy of the perpetuity of Judah's kingdom, fulfilled in David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), and of Lange ("until he himself comes home as the Shiloh or Rest-bringer"), who also discerns in Judah a typical foreshadowing of the Messiah, may be mentioned as examples of ingenious, but scarcely convincing, exposition. <span class="cmt_word">And unto him shall the gathering of the people be.</span> Not "<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">ipse erit expectatio gentium</span> (Vulgate), with which also agrees the Syriac, or "to him nations will flock" (Samaritan), <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (Aquila), but to him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Shiloh, will be not <span class="accented">aggregatio populorum</span> (Calvin), but the submission or willing obedience (a word occurring elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>) of nations or peoples (Onkelos, Targum of Jonathan, Kimchi, Aben Ezra, Dathius, Rosenmuller, Keil, Kalisch, Gerlach, Murphy, Tayler Lewis, 'Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">Binding his foal unto the vine,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not Shiloh, but Judah. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> has the archaic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> appended, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-39.htm">Genesis 31:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-16.htm">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a> - <span class="cmt_word">and his ass's colt unto the choice vine</span>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (fem. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>) was a nobler kind of vine which grew in Syria, with small berries, roundish and of a dark color, with soft and hardly perceptible stones (Gesenius, p. 796). <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is an archaic form of the construct stats which occurs only here. <span class="cmt_word">He washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> is a <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and is either put by aphaeresis for <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> which occurs in the Samaritan Version, or is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, an uncertain root, signifying to cover (Gesenius, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk</span>. Otherwise rendered "redder than wine," and "whiter than milk" (LXX., Vulgate, Targum of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), as a description of Judah's person, which scarcely seems so appropriate as the received translation (Calvin, Rosenmuller, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Lange, and others), which, completes the preceding picture of Judah s prosperity. Not only would Judah s soil be so fertile that its vines should be employed for trying asses and colts to their branches, but the grapes of those vines should be so plentiful and luscious as to make wine run like the water in which he washed his clothes, while the wine and milk should be so exhilarating and invigorating as to imp-art a sparkling brilliance to the eyes and a charming whiteness to the teeth. The aged prophet, it has been appropriately remarked, has here no thought of debauchery, but only paints before the mind's eye a picture of the richest and most ornate enjoyment (Lange). <span class="accented">Minime consentaneum esse videtur profusam intemperiem et projectionem in benedictione censeri</span> (Calvin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:8-12 Judah's name signifies praise. God was praised for him, chap. 29:35, praised by him, and praised in him; therefore his brethren shall praise him. Judah should be a strong and courageous tribe. Judah is compared, not to a lion raging and ranging, but to a lion enjoying the satisfaction of his power and success, without creating vexation to others; this is to be truly great. Judah should be the royal tribe, the tribe from which Messiah the Prince should come. Shiloh, that promised Seed in whom the earth should be blessed, that peaceable and prosperous One, or Saviour, he shall come of Judah. Thus dying Jacob at a great distance saw Christ's day, and it was his comfort and support on his death-bed. Till Christ's coming, Judah possessed authority, but after his crucifixion this was shortened, and according to what Christ foretold, Jerusalem was destroyed, and all the poor harassed remnant of Jews were confounded together. Much which is here said concerning Judah, is to be applied to our Lord Jesus. In him there is plenty of all which is nourishing and refreshing to the soul, and which maintains and cheers the Divine life in it. He is the true Vine; wine is the appointed symbol of his blood, which is drink indeed, as shed for sinners, and applied in faith; and all the blessings of his gospel are wine and milk, without money and without price, to which every thirsty soul is welcome. Isa 55:1.</body></html>
