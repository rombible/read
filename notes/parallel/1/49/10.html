The Targum of Onkelos renders, "from his children's children."<p><span class= "bld">Until Shiloh come.</span>--Many modern critics translate, "until he come to Shiloh," but this is to be rejected, first, as being contrary to all the ancient versions; and, secondly, as turning sense into nonsense. The town of Shiloh was in the tribe of Ephraim, and we know of no way in which Judah ever went thither. The ark was for a time at Shiloh, but the place lost all importance and sank into utter obscurity after its destruction by the Philistines, long before Judah took the leading part in the commonwealth of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Shiloh.</span>--There are several interpretations of this word, depending upon different ways of spelling it. First, Jerome, in the Vulg., translates it, "He who shall be sent." He read, therefore, <span class= "ital">Shalu'ch. </span>which differs from the reading in the Hebrew text by omitting the <span class= "ital">yod, </span>and putting the guttural <span class= "greekheb"></span> for <span class= "ital">h </span>(Heb., <span class= "greekheb"></span>) as the final letter. We have, secondly, <span class= "ital">Shiloh, </span>the reading of the present Hebrew text. This would mean, <span class= "ital">Peaceful, </span>or <span class= "ital">Peace-maker, </span>and agrees with the title given to the Messiah by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>). But, thirdly, all the versions excepting the Vulg. read <span class= "ital">Sheloh. </span>Thus, the LXX. has, "He for whom it is laid up" (or, according to other MSS., "the things laid up for him."). With the former reading, Aquila and Symmachus agree; with the latter, Theodotion, Epiphanius, and others, showing that Sheloh was the reading in the centuries immediately after the Nativity of our Lord. The Samaritan transcript of the Hebrew text into Samaritan letters reads Sheloh, and the translation into Aramaic treats the word as a proper name, and renders, "Until Sheloh come." Onkelos boldly paraphrases, "Until Messiah come, whose is the kingdom;" and, finally, the Syriac has, "Until he come, whose it is." There is thus overwhelming evidence in favour of the reading Sheloh, and to this we must add that Sheloh is the reading even of several Hebrew MSS. We may, in fact, sum up the evidence by saying that the reading <span class= "ital">Shiloh, </span>even in the Hebrew text, has only modern authority in its favour, and that all ancient authorities are in favour of Sheloh; for even Jerome omits the <span class= "ital">yod, </span>though he changes the aspirate at the end into a guttural.<p>Sheloh literally means, <span class= "ital">Whose it is, </span>and is an Aramaic form, such as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>, where we have observed that these Aramaisms are a proof either of extreme antiquity, or of a very late date. We find another in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm" title="The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.">Judges 5:7</a>, in the song of Deborah, confessedly a very ancient composition; and the form is quite in its place here in the elevated phraseology of this blessing, and in the mouth of Jacob, who had lived so long in a land where an Aramaic dialect was spoken.<p>Finally, Ezekiel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm" title="I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.">Ezekiel 21:27</a> (Heb., 32), quotes Jacob's words, using however the Hebrew idiom, "Until he come, whose is the right." And St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>) refers to it in the words, "Until the seed come to whom it is promised," where the latter words seem to be a free rendering of the phrase in the LXX., "for whom it is laid up."<p>The passage has always been regarded as Messianic, not merely by Christians, but by the Jews, all whose ancient writers, including the Talmud, explain the name Shiloh, or Sheloh, of the Messiah. But the Targum of Onkelos would of itself be a sufficient proof, as we have there not the opinions or knowledge of one man, but the traditional explanation of the Pentateuch, handed down orally from the time of Ezra, and committed to writing probably in the first century of the Christian era. The objection has, indeed, been made in modern times that the patriarchs had no Messianic expectations. With those who believe in prophecy such an objection can have no weight; but independently of this, the promise made to Abraham, and solemnly confirmed to Jacob, that in his seed all the kindreds of the earth should be blessed, was pre-eminently Messianic: as was also the name Jehovah; for that name was the embodiment of the promise made to Eve, and beginning with her cry of hope that she had gotten the Coming One, had become by the time of Enoch the symbol of the expectation of mankind that God would appear on earth in human nature to save them.<p><span class= "bld">Unto him shall the gathering of the people be.</span>--The word used here is rare, and the translation "gathering" was a guess of Rashi. Really it means <span class= "ital">obedience, </span>as is proved by the one other place where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm" title="The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.">Proverbs 30:17</a>). For "people" the Heb. has <span class= "ital">peoples. </span>Not Israel only, "the people," but all nations are to obey Him "whose is the kingdom." This is the rendering of Onkelos, "and him shall the peoples obey;" and of the Samaritan Version, "and at his hand shall the peoples be led." The LXX., Syriac, and Vulg. agree in rendering, "and he shall be the expectation of the nations."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:8-12 Judah's name signifies praise. God was praised for him, chap. 29:35, praised by him, and praised in him; therefore his brethren shall praise him. Judah should be a strong and courageous tribe. Judah is compared, not to a lion raging and ranging, but to a lion enjoying the satisfaction of his power and success, without creating vexation to others; this is to be truly great. Judah should be the royal tribe, the tribe from which Messiah the Prince should come. Shiloh, that promised Seed in whom the earth should be blessed, that peaceable and prosperous One, or Saviour, he shall come of Judah. Thus dying Jacob at a great distance saw Christ's day, and it was his comfort and support on his death-bed. Till Christ's coming, Judah possessed authority, but after his crucifixion this was shortened, and according to what Christ foretold, Jerusalem was destroyed, and all the poor harassed remnant of Jews were confounded together. Much which is here said concerning Judah, is to be applied to our Lord Jesus. In him there is plenty of all which is nourishing and refreshing to the soul, and which maintains and cheers the Divine life in it. He is the true Vine; wine is the appointed symbol of his blood, which is drink indeed, as shed for sinners, and applied in faith; and all the blessings of his gospel are wine and milk, without money and without price, to which every thirsty soul is welcome. Isa 55:1.</body></html>
