Jacob throughout it seems struggling with himself, and anxious to bestow more than was in his power. Joseph was his dearest son, the child of his chief and most beloved wife; he was, too, the saviour of Israel's family, and the actual ruler of Egypt; and his father had even bestowed upon him the portion of the firstborn in giving him two tribes, and to the rest but one. Nevertheless, he cannot bestow upon him the sovereignty. In clear terms he had described Judah as the lion, whose lordly strength should give Israel victory and dominion, and the sceptre must remain his until He whose right it is to rule should come. And thus Jacob magnifies again and again, but in obscure terms, his blessing upon Joseph, which, when analyzed, amounts simply to excessive fruitfulness, with no Messianic or spiritual prerogative. Beginning with this, Jacob next dwells upon Joseph's trials, and upon the manliness with which he had borne and overcome them; and then magnifies the blessedness of the earthly lot of his race, won for them by the personal worth of Joseph, with a description of which Jacob ends his words.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">A fruitful bough.</span>--Literally the words are, "Son of a fruitful tree is Joseph; son of a fruitful tree by a fountain: the daughters spread over the wall." That is, Joseph is like a fruitful tree planted near a fountain of living water, and of which the branches, or suckers, springing from it overtop the wall built round the spring for its protection. This fruitfulness of Joseph was shown by the vast number of his descendants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall</span> - literally, <span class="accented">son</span> <span class="accented">of a fruit tree, Joseph</span>; <span class="accented">son o/a fruit tree at the well</span>; <span class="accented">daughters run</span> (each one of them: <span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, 'Grammar,' &sect; 146, 4) <span class="accented">over the wall</span>. The structure of the clauses, the order of the words, the repetition of the thoughts, supply a glimpse into the fond emotion with which the aged prophet approached the blessing of his beloved son Joseph. Under the image of a fruit tree, probably a vine, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, planted by a well, whence it draws forth necessary moisture, and, sending forth its young twigs or offshoots over the supporting walls, he pictures the fruitfulness and prosperity which should afterwards attend the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, as the twofold representative of Joseph, with perhaps a backward glance at the service which Joseph had performed in Egypt by gathering up and dispensing the produce of the land for the salvation of his family and people. <span class="cmt_word">The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him</span> - literally, they <span class="accented">provoked him, and shot at, and laid snares for him, masters of arrows</span>, though Kalisch translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and they assembled in multitudes, which yields a sense sufficiently clear. It is sometimes alleged (Keil, Lange, 'Speaker's Commentary') that the words contain no allusion to the personal history of Joseph, but solely to the later fortunes of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh; but even if they do point to the subsequent hostilities which Joseph's descendants should incur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4-6</a>), it is almost morally certain that the image of the shooting archers which he selects to depict their adversaries was suggested to his mind by the early lot of his beloved son (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Gerlach, Murphy, and others). <span class="cmt_word">But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</span> Notwithstanding the multitudinous and fierce assaults which had been made on Joseph, he had risen superior to his adversaries; his bow had continued firm and unbroken (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-19.htm">Job 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-19.htm">Job 33:19</a>), and his arms had been rendered active and flexible - neither <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (LXX.), <span class="accented">dissoluta sunt vincula brachiorum et manuum</span> (Vulgate), as if Joseph s enemies were the subjects referred to; nor, "Therefore gold was placed upon his arms (Onkelos, Raehi, and others), referring to the gift of Pharaoh's ring - by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, i.e. God, who had proved himself to be Jacob's Mighty One by the powerful protection vouchsafed to his servant The title here ascribed to God occurs afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel.</span> If the clause is parenthetical, it may signify either that from the time of Joseph's exaltation he became the shepherd (who sustained) and the stone of (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rock which supported) Israel (Oleaster); or that from God, the Mighty One of Jacob, Joseph received strength to become the shepherd and stone of Israel (Pererius, Ainsworth, Lawson, Patrick, and others), in which capacity he served as a prefiguration of the Good Shepherd who was also to become the Rock or Foundation of his Church (Calvin, Pererius, Candiish, etc.); but if the clause is rather co-ordinate with that which precedes and that which follows, as the introductory particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> appears to suggest, then the words "shepherd and stone of Israel" will apply to <span class="accented">God</span>, and the sentiment will be that the hands of Joseph were made strong from the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, from there (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from there where is, or from him who is) the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel (Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Gerlach, Lange, <span class="accented">et alii</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from the</span> (<span class="accented">led of thy father, and he shall help thee</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who shall help thee); <span class="cmt_word">and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee</span> - literally, and <span class="accented">with</span> (sc. the aid <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented">the Almighty, and he shall bless</span> thee. It is unnecessary to change <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>. into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (LXX., Vulgate, Samaritan, Syriac, Ewald), or to insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, as thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (Knobel, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch), since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> may be understood here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>, in the sense of helpful communion (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb</span>. "From the God of Jacob, and by the help of the Almighty, should the rain and dew of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>), and fountains and brooks which spring from the great deep or the abyss of the earth, pour their fertilizing waters over Joseph's land, so that everything that had womb and breast should become pregnant, bring forth and suckle" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.</span> The meaning is, according to this rendering, which some adopt (the Targums, Vulgate, Syriac, Saadias, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lange, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), that the blessings which Jacob pronounced upon Joseph surpassed those which he himself had received from Abraham and Isaac, either as far as the primary mountains towered above the earth (Keil, Murphy), or, while exceeding the benedictions of his ancestors, those now delivered by himself would last while the hills endured (Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'). But the words may be otherwise rendered: "The blessings of thy father prevail over, are mightier than the blessings of the mountains of eternity, the delight, or glory, or loveliness of the hills of eternity (LXX., Dathe, Michaelis, Gesenius, Bohlen, Kalisch, Gerlach, and others); and in favor of this may be adduced the beautiful parallelism between the last two clauses, which the received translation overlooks. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren</span> - literally, of <span class="accented">him, the separated</span> (from <span class="accented">nazar, to separate</span>) <span class="accented">from his brethren</span> (Onkelos, Rashi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, and others), though by some different renderings are preferred, as, e.g., the crowned among his brethren (LXX. Syriac, Targum of Jerusalem, Kimchi, Kalisch, Gerlach), taking <span class="accented">nazir</span> to signify he who wears the <span class="accented">nezer</span>, or royal diadem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:22-27 The blessing of Joseph is very full. What Jacob says of him, is history as well as prophecy. Jacob reminds him of the difficulties and fiery darts of temptations he had formerly struggled through. His faith did not fail, but through his trials he bore all his burdens with firmness, and did not do anything unbecoming. All our strength for resisting temptations, and bearing afflictions, comes from God; his grace is sufficient. Joseph became the shepherd of Israel, to take care of his father and family; also the stone of Israel, their foundation and strong support. In this, as in many other things, Joseph was a remarkable type of the Good Shepherd, and tried Corner Stone of the whole church of God. Blessings are promised to Joseph's posterity, typical of the vast and everlasting blessings which come upon the spiritual seed of Christ. Jacob blessed all his sons, but especially Joseph, who was separated from his brethren. Not only separated in Egypt, but, possessing eminent dignity, and more devoted to God. Of Benjamin it is said, He shall ravin as a wolf. Jacob was guided in what he said by the Spirit of prophecy, and not by natural affection; else he would have spoken with more tenderness of his beloved son Benjamin. Concerning him he only foresees and foretells, that his posterity should be a warlike tribe, strong and daring, and that they should enrich themselves with the spoils of their enemies; that they should be active. Blessed Paul was of this tribe, Ro 11:1; Php 3:5; he, in the morning of his day, devoured the prey as a persecutor, but in the evening divided the spoils as a preacher; he shared the blessings of Judah's Lion, and assisted in his victories.</body></html>
