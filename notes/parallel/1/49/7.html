The next sentence literally is, <span class= "ital">And their rage, for it was hard. </span>The indignation at Joseph's dreams, told them by him innocently, led them to an act harsh and in human (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-21.htm" title="And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he sought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come on us.">Genesis 42:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I will divide them . . . --</span>This prediction was equally fulfilled in the fact that neither of the tribes of Simeon and Levi possessed any political importance in Israel. The brothers had banded together to oppress their kindred; their descendants were powerless. But in every other respect the fulfilment was utterly diverse. In the wilderness the Simeonites dwindled from 59,300 to 22,200 men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-23.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.">Numbers 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-14.htm" title="These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 26:14</a>); and after the conquest of Canaan, were so feeble as to have only fifteen towns assigned them, scattered about in the territory of Judah. And there they melted away, being either absorbed into the tribe among whom they dwelt, crwithdrawing to wander as nomads in the wilderness of Paran. In Levi's case the curse was changed into a blessing by the faithfulness of the tribe upon a very trying occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-26.htm" title="Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.">Exodus 32:26-28</a>); and we learn from it the great lesson that the Divine rewards and punishments, even when specified in prophecy, are nevertheless conditional upon human conduct. Of this diversity of fulfilment there is not the slightest indication in Jacob's blessing, while in that of Moses the lot of Levi is described in terms of the highest praise, and that of Simeon is passed over in inglorious silence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:3-7 Reuben was the first-born; but by gross sin, he forfeited the birthright. The character of Reuben is, that he was unstable as water. Men do not thrive, because they do not fix. Reuben's sin left a lasting infamy upon his family. Let us never do evil, then we need not fear being told of it. Simeon and Levi were passionate and revengeful. The murder of the Shechemites is a proof of this. Jacob protested against that barbarous act. Our soul is our honour; by its powers we are distinguished from, and raised above, the beasts that perish. We ought, from our hearts, to abhor all bloody and mischievous men. Cursed be their anger. Jacob does not curse their persons, but their lusts. I will divide them. The sentence as it respects Levi was turned into a blessing. This tribe performed an acceptable service in their zeal against the worshippers of the golden calf, Ex 32. Being set apart to God as priests, they were in that character scattered through the nation of Israel.</body></html>
