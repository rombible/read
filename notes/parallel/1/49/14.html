(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm" title="And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers.">Genesis 16:12</a>, where Ishmael is compared to the wild ass, which adds to these qualities the love of freedom.) His real character was slothful, inactive, and commonplace. Jacob therefore likens him to a "strong ass;" Heb., <span class= "ital">an ass of bone, </span>that is, one coarsely bred, as animals of high parentage have small bones. He is thus fit only to be a drudge, and with the laziness of a cart-horse lies down "between two burdens." The word occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm" title="Why stayed you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.">Judges 5:16</a>, and is there more correctly rendered <span class= "ital">sheepfolds. </span>More exactly it means the pens in which the cattle were folded during the nights of summer; and it is in the dual form, because these pens were divided into two parts for the larger and smaller cattle. Thus Issachar, stretched at ease between his cattle-pens, gives us the idea of a tribe occupied with pastoral pursuits, and destitute of all higher aspirations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens -</span> literally, <span class="accented">an ass of bone - hence</span> a strong, powerful animal, <span class="accented">asinus fortis</span> (Vulgate), <span class="accented">asinus walidi corporis</span> (Gesenius), <span class="accented">asinus robustus</span> (<span class="accented">Rosenmuller</span>) <span class="accented">- lying down between the folds</span>, or cattle-pens, which received and protected the flocks by night, the dual being used probably because such pens were divided into two parts for different kinds of cattle (Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, 'Speaker s Commentary,' etc.), though the word <span class="accented">mishpetaim has</span> been also rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">inter terminos</span> (Vulgate, Rosenm&uuml;ller), "within their own boundaries" (Onkelos, Targums of Jerusalem and Jonathan), "between two burdens" (A. V., Lange, Murphy, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant.</span> Issachar was to manifest a keen appreciation of the land or portion of territory that should be assigned to him, and to renounce the warlike spirit and military enterprises of his brethren for the indolent and luxurious repose of his fat pastures, crouching between his sheep-folds, or rejoicing within his tents, like a lazy ass, capable indeed of mighty efforts, but too self-satisfied to put forth much exertion, devoting himself to agriculture and pastoral pursuits, and preferring rather to pay tribute to his brethren, in order to secure their protection, than to leave his ploughshare and cast aside his shepherd's crook to follow them into the tented field of war, as the patriarch next describes. <span class="cmt_word">And bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute</span> - or a tributary servant. The phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, though sometimes used of servitude under a foreign sovereignty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-11.htm">Deuteronomy 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>), commonly refers to tribute rendered by labor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-8.htm">2 Chronicles 8:8</a>), and is correctly rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (Aquila), <span class="accented">factusque est tributo serviens</span> (Vulgate).

God appoints the bounds of our habitation. It is our wisdom and duty to accommodate ourselves to our lot, and to improve it; if Zebulun dwell at the heaven of the sea, let him be for a haven of ships. Concerning Issachar: he saw that the land was pleasant, yielding not only pleasant prospects, but pleasant fruits to recompense his toils. Let us, with an eye of faith, see the heavenly rest to be good, and that land of promise to be pleasant; this will make our present services easy. Dan should, by art, and policy, and surprise, gain advantages against his enemies, like a serpent biting the heel of the traveller. Jacob, almost spent, and ready to faint, relieves himself with those words, I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord! The salvation he waited for was Christ, the promised Seed; now that he was going to be gathered to his people, he breathes after Him to whom the gathering of the people shall be. He declared plainly that he sought heaven, the better country, Heb 11:13,14. Now he is going to enjoy the salvation, he comforts himself that he had waited for the salvation. Christ, as our way to heaven, is to be waited on; and heaven, as our rest in Christ, is to be waited for. It is the comfort of a dying saint thus to have waited for the salvation of the Lord; for then he shall have what he has been waiting for.</body></html>
