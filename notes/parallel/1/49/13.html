The territory of the tribe lay upon the inland sea of Gennesaret, but did not extend to the shore of the Mediterranean. We do not know of any literal fulfilment of the prediction, but Moses also speaks of Zebulun and Issachar as tribes that would "suck of the abundance of the seas." It is very possible that, living in the neighbourhood of the Ph?nicians, they took part in maritime pursuits; and thus the general meaning of the blessing may be that Zebulun would be a tribe, not of agriculturists, but of traders. It is also remarkable that Tyre, which was much nearer the tribe of Zebulun, and was the leading city in David's time, is not mentioned, but only the more ancient town of Sidon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea</span>; - not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">in statione navium</span> (Vulgate), but to, or at, or beside, the. shore (from the idea of being washed by the waters of the ocean) of the waters, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Galilean and Mediterranean seas - <span class="cmt_word">and he shall be for an haven of ships</span>; - literally, <span class="accented">and he to, at, or on, a shore of ships, i.e.</span> a shore where ships are unloaded (<span class="accented">so</span>. shall dwell), the words being a repetition of the previous thought, with only the expansion, suggested by the term <span class="accented">ships</span>, that Zebulun's calling should be in the direction of commerce; - <span class="cmt_word">and his border shall be unto Zidon</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and his side, or hinder part</span> (sc. shall be, or extend), <span class="accented">towards</span>, rather than unto, - <span class="accented">usque</span> ad (Vulgate), <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">LXX</span>.)<span class="accented">, - Zidon</span>, since the territory subsequently allotted to Zebulun neither actually touched the Mediterranean, nor reached to Zidon - a circumstance that may be noted as an indirect hint that this prophecy was not spoken, or even first written, after the occupation of the land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:13-18 Concerning Zebulun: if prophecy says, Zebulun shall be a haven of ships, be sure Providence will so plant him. God appoints the bounds of our habitation. It is our wisdom and duty to accommodate ourselves to our lot, and to improve it; if Zebulun dwell at the heaven of the sea, let him be for a haven of ships. Concerning Issachar: he saw that the land was pleasant, yielding not only pleasant prospects, but pleasant fruits to recompense his toils. Let us, with an eye of faith, see the heavenly rest to be good, and that land of promise to be pleasant; this will make our present services easy. Dan should, by art, and policy, and surprise, gain advantages against his enemies, like a serpent biting the heel of the traveller. Jacob, almost spent, and ready to faint, relieves himself with those words, I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord! The salvation he waited for was Christ, the promised Seed; now that he was going to be gathered to his people, he breathes after Him to whom the gathering of the people shall be. He declared plainly that he sought heaven, the better country, Heb 11:13,14. Now he is going to enjoy the salvation, he comforts himself that he had waited for the salvation. Christ, as our way to heaven, is to be waited on; and heaven, as our rest in Christ, is to be waited for. It is the comfort of a dying saint thus to have waited for the salvation of the Lord; for then he shall have what he has been waiting for.</body></html>
