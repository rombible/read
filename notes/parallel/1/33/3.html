He endeavoured, nevertheless, by his sevenfold obeisance in acknowledgment of Esau's superiority, to propitiate him; for the cause of the quarrel had been Jacob's usurpation of Esau's right of precedence as the first born. This bowing in the East is made by bending the body forward with the arms crossed, and the right hand held over the heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> (the introduction of the pronoun giving emphasis to the statement) <span class="cmt_word">passed over before them</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. passed on in front of them, thus chivalrously putting himself in the place of danger), <span class="cmt_word">and bowed himself to the ground</span> - not completely prostrating the body, as Abraham did in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>, but bending forward till the upper part of it became parallel with the ground, a mode of expressing deep reverence and respect, which may be seen to life in Oriental countries at the present day (Roberts, 'Oriental Illustrations,' p. 41) - <span class="cmt_word">seven times</span> (not in immediate succession, but bowing and advancing), <span class="cmt_word">until he came near to his brother</span>. The conduct of Jacob was dictated neither by artful hypocrisy nor by unmanly timidity; but by true politeness and a sincere desire to conciliate. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> as such it was accepted by <span class="cmt_word">Esau</span>, who <span class="cmt_word">ran to meet him,</span> and, his better feelings kindling at the sight of his long-absent brother, <span class="cmt_word">embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him</span> - as Joseph afterwards did to Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-14.htm">Genesis 45:14, 15</a>), though the <span class="accented">puncta extraordinaria</span> of the Masorites over the word "kissed" seem to indicate either that in their judgment Esau was incapable of such fraternal affection (Delitzsch, Kalisch), or that the word was suspicious, Origen appearing not to have found it in his codices (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil), unless indeed the conjecture be correct that the word was marked to draw attention to the power of God's grace in changing Esau's heart (Ainsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And they wept</span> - the LXX. adding <span class="accented">both</span>. "All this is beautiful, natural, Oriental" ('Land and Book,' p. 372). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-16 Jacob, having by prayer committed his case to God, went on his way. Come what will, nothing can come amiss to him whose heart is fixed, trusting in God. Jacob bowed to Esau. A humble, submissive behaviour goes far towards turning away wrath. Esau embraced Jacob. God has the hearts of all men in his hands, and can turn them when and how he pleases. It is not in vain to trust in God, and to call upon him in the day of trouble. And when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. Esau receives Jacob as a brother, and much tenderness passes between them. Esau asks, Who are those with thee? To this common question, Jacob spoke like himself, like a man whose eyes are ever directed towards the Lord. Jacob urged Esau, though his fear was over, and he took his present. It is well when men's religion makes them generous, free-hearted, and open-handed. But Jacob declined Esau's offer to accompany him. It is not desirable to be too intimate with superior ungodly relations, who will expect us to join in their vanities, or at least to wink at them, though they blame, and perhaps mock at, our religion. Such will either be a snare to us, or offended with us. We shall venture the loss of all things, rather than endanger our souls, if we know their value; rather than renounce Christ, if we truly love him. And let Jacob's care and tender attention to his family and flocks remind us of the good Shepherd of our souls, who gathers the lambs with his arm, and carries them in his bosom, and gently leads those that are with young, Isa 40:11. As parents, teachers or pastors, we should all follow his example.</body></html>
