Jacob a century later finds it necessary to buy even the ground on which to pitch his tent, though his cattle might still roam freely about for pasture. This, however, would certainly not have been required except in the immediate neighbourhood of a town. As he had now recovered from his sprain, he returns to his habits as a nomad, and dwells in a tent. In this, the first parcel of ground possessed by Jacob, the embalmed body of Joseph was buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>); and it is remarkable that the possession of it was secure, even when the owners were far away in Egypt.<p><span class= "bld">An hundred pieces of money.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a hundred hesitas. </span>It is plain that the kesita was an ingot of metal of some considerable value, from what is said in the Book of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-11.htm" title="We are all one man's sons; we are true men, your servants are no spies.">Genesis 42:11</a>), that each of his friends gave the patriarch "one kesita and a nose-ring of gold." The etymology of the word is uncertain, and apparently all knowledge of its meaning had at an early period passed away, inasmuch as Onkelos and some of the versions translate it <span class= "ital">lambs, </span>for which rendering there is no support.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he bought a parcel of a field</span>, - literally, the portion (from a root signifying to divide) of <span class="accented">the field</span> - <span class="cmt_word">where he had spread his tent</span>, - and in which he afterwards sank a well (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">at the hand of the children of Homer, Shechem's father</span> (after whom the town was named, <span class="accented">ut supra</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>for an hundred pieces of money</span> - or kesitahs, the etymology of which is uncertain (Kalisch), though connected by some philologists (Gesenius, Furst) with <span class="accented">kasat</span>, to weigh; translated lambs (Onkelos, LXX., Vulgate), but believed to have been a certain weight now unknown (Michaelis, 'Suppl.,' p. 2207), or a piece of money of a definite value, perhaps the price of a lamb (Murphy), which, like the shekel, was used for purposes of commercial exchange by the patriarchs (Gesenius) - probably a coin stamped with the figure of a lamb (Bochart, Munter); but coined money does not appear to have been of so great antiquity (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Wordsworth, Alford). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:17-20 Jacob did not content himself with words of thanks for God's favour to him, but gave real thanks. Also he kept up religion, and the worship of God in his family. Where we have a tent, God must have an altar. Jacob dedicated this altar to the honour of El-elohe-Israel, God, the God of Israel; to the honour of God, the only living and true God; and to the honour of the God of Israel, as a God in covenant with him. Israel's God is Israel's glory. Blessed be his name, he is still the mighty God, the God of Israel. May we praise his name, and rejoice in his love, through our pilgrimage here on earth, and for ever in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
