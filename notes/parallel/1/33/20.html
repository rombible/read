This especially appears in his calling the altar "El, the Elohim of Israel." Of course the title of Jehovah could not be used here, as the altar had a special reference to the change of Jacob's name, and was an acknowledgment on his own part of his now being Israel, a prince with El, that is. with God.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he erected there an altar,</span> - as Abram his ancestor had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and called it</span> - not invoked upon it, <span class="accented">invocavit super illud</span> (Vulgate), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (LXX.), but named it (Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, etc.) - <span class="cmt_word">El-elohe-Israel</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God, the God of Israel; meaning, he called it the altar of God, the God of Israel (Rosenm&uuml;ller), or, reading <span class="accented">el</span> as a preposition, "To the God of Israel" (Quarry, p. 508). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:17-20 Jacob did not content himself with words of thanks for God's favour to him, but gave real thanks. Also he kept up religion, and the worship of God in his family. Where we have a tent, God must have an altar. Jacob dedicated this altar to the honour of El-elohe-Israel, God, the God of Israel; to the honour of God, the only living and true God; and to the honour of the God of Israel, as a God in covenant with him. Israel's God is Israel's glory. Blessed be his name, he is still the mighty God, the God of Israel. May we praise his name, and rejoice in his love, through our pilgrimage here on earth, and for ever in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
