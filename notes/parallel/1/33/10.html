There is much of Oriental hyperbole in comparing the sight of Esau to the beholding of the face of Deity, but it clearly conveyed the idea that Esau was using his power as generously and lovingly as is the wont of God; and God was so much nearer to the Hebrew in those simple days than he is to men now that science has revealed to them the immensity of His attributes, that there was no irreverence in the comparison.<p>The behaviour of Esau is very generous. He wished to spare his brother so large a present, and therefore leads the conversation to it, knowing, of course, what was the meaning of the five herds, as their drivers had delivered to him Jacob's message. To have refused it, however, would have been a mark of hostility, especially as Jacob represented it as the gift of an inferior for the purpose of obtaining the favour of one from whom he had feared danger. But Esau expostulates with his brother. He too was rich, and Jacob should keep what was his own. But Jacob still urges its acceptance as the proof of goodwill, magnifies the value of Esau's favour, and declares that by God's goodness he has still abundance, even after giving his brother so princely a present. It is called "blessing" because it was considered lucky to receive a gift, and of all good-luck God was the giver. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-27.htm" title="And now this blessing which your handmaid has brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.">1Samuel 25:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5be;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, because (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Quarry), or, for this purpose (Keil, Kalisch, Hengetenberg, Lange, Ewald. <span class="accented">Vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-8.htm">Genesis 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-26.htm">Genesis 38:26</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">as a vision of the/ace of Elohim</span>, in which language Jacob neither uses adulation towards his brother (Tostatius), nor calla him a god in the sense in which heathen potentates are styled deities (Vatablus, Arabic, Chaldee), nor simply uses a superlative expression to indicate the majesty (Menochius) or benevolence (Ainsworth) of Esau's countenance, contended with him at the Jabbok (Bush); but either that he had received from Esau the same friendly welcome that one coming into God's presence would receive from him (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'), or that he had come into Esau's presence with the same feelings of penitence as if he had been coming before God (Kalisch), or that, as he had already seen the face of God and his life was preserved, so now he had seen the face of Esau, and the anticipated destruction had not been inflicted on him (Quarry), either of which accords with the words that follow - <span class="cmt_word">and thou wast pleased with me</span> - literally, <span class="accented">thou hast graciously received me</span>, the unexpressed thought being, as already I have been favorably accepted by Elohim. Hence Jacob with greater urgency renews his entreaty that Esau would not decline his proffered gift, saying, <span class="cmt_word">Take, I pray thee, my blessing</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my present, the word signifying, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-27.htm">1 Samuel 25:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>, a gift by which one seeks to express good will) <span class="cmt_word">that is brought to thee</span>; - or, which has been caused to come to thee, adding, as a special reason to induce him to accept - <span class="cmt_word">because God hath dealt graciously with me,</span> - Elohim, it has been thought, is used here and in ver. 5 by Jacob instead of Jehovah, either "<span class="accented">to</span> avoid reminding Esau of the blessing of Jehovah which had occasioned his absence" (Delitzsch, Keil), or, " because Jehovah was exalted far above the level of Esau's superficial religion" Hengstenberg); but it is just possible that by its employment Jacob only wished to acknowledge the Divine hand in the remark- able prosperity which had attended him in Haran - <span class="cmt_word">and because I have enough</span> - literally, <span class="accented">there is to</span> me all, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. everything I can wish (Murphy), all things as the heir of the promise (Keil). The expression is stronger than that used by Esau (ver. 9), and is regarded by some (Ainsworth) as indicating a more contented spirit than that evinced by Esau. <span class="cmt_word">And he urged him</span>. In Eastern countries the acceptance of a gift is equivalent to the striking of a covenant of friendship. If your present be received by your superior yon may rely on his friendship; if it be declined you have everything to fear. It was on this ground that Jacob was so urgent in pressing Esau to accept his present (cf. A. Clarke <span class="accented">in loco</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And he took it,</span> and so gave Jacob an assurance of his complete reconciliation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-16 Jacob, having by prayer committed his case to God, went on his way. Come what will, nothing can come amiss to him whose heart is fixed, trusting in God. Jacob bowed to Esau. A humble, submissive behaviour goes far towards turning away wrath. Esau embraced Jacob. God has the hearts of all men in his hands, and can turn them when and how he pleases. It is not in vain to trust in God, and to call upon him in the day of trouble. And when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. Esau receives Jacob as a brother, and much tenderness passes between them. Esau asks, Who are those with thee? To this common question, Jacob spoke like himself, like a man whose eyes are ever directed towards the Lord. Jacob urged Esau, though his fear was over, and he took his present. It is well when men's religion makes them generous, free-hearted, and open-handed. But Jacob declined Esau's offer to accompany him. It is not desirable to be too intimate with superior ungodly relations, who will expect us to join in their vanities, or at least to wink at them, though they blame, and perhaps mock at, our religion. Such will either be a snare to us, or offended with us. We shall venture the loss of all things, rather than endanger our souls, if we know their value; rather than renounce Christ, if we truly love him. And let Jacob's care and tender attention to his family and flocks remind us of the good Shepherd of our souls, who gathers the lambs with his arm, and carries them in his bosom, and gently leads those that are with young, Isa 40:11. As parents, teachers or pastors, we should all follow his example.</body></html>
