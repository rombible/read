Pent. has <span class= "ital">shalom,"</span>safe"; but <span class= "ital">shalem </span>is right, and means <span class= "ital">whole, sound. </span>Onkelos, however, followed by most modern commentators, renders it <span class= "ital">in peace, </span>but this too would not mean <span class= "ital">peaceably, </span>but that his troubles were now at an end, and his lameness cured. Philippsohn's rendering, however, is more exact, namely, <span class= "ital">wohlbehalten, </span>in good condition. Rashi also, no mean authority, sees in it an allusion to the cure of Jacob's lameness. As Shechem was a man, his city would not be Shalem, but that called after his own name. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a> it is called "Sichern," where see Note. Sichern was probably the old name, but after the cruel fate brought upon it by Shechem's misconduct the spelling was modified to suit the history.<p><span class= "bld">In the land of Canaan.</span>--Jacob therefore had now crossed the river Jordan, and so far completed his homeward journey. Probably as soon as he had recovered from his lameness he visited his father, but as his possessions were large, and Esau was the chief at Hebron, there was no room at present for him to dwell there, nor in fact was this possible until Isaac's death. But as we find Deborah with them soon afterwards, it is plain that he had gone to visit Isaac, and, finding his mother dead, had brought away with him her beloved nurse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob</span> (leaving Succoth) <span class="cmt_word">came to Shalem</span> - the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, rendered by some expositors as here (LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, Luther, Calvin, Peele, Wordsworth), is better taken as an adverb signifying in peace or in safety (Onkelos, Saadias, Rashi, Dathius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), meaning that Jacob Was now sound in his limb (Jarehi) and <span class="cmt_word">safe</span> in his person, being no more endangered by Esau (Gerundensis in Drusius), or that he had hitherto met with no misfortune, though soon to encounter one in the instance of Dinah (Patrick), or that the expectations of Jacob expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-21.htm">Genesis 28:21</a> (to which there is an obvious allusion) were now fulfilled (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">a city of Shechem</span>, - if Shalem be the name of the town, then probably Shechem is the name of the person referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>, viz., the son of Hamor the Hivite (Drusius, Peele); but if Shalem mean <span class="accented">incolumis</span>, then the present clause must be rendered "to the city of Shechem," the city being already built and named - <span class="cmt_word">which is in the land of Canaan</span>, - Bush thinks that Jacob had originally contemplated entering Canaan from the south after rounding the Dead Sea, probably with a view to reach Beersheba, but that, after his interview with Esau, he suddenly altered his route, and entered Canaan directly by crossing the Jordan and driving up his flocks and herds to Shechem, the first halting-place of Abraham (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 12:6), which may perhaps lend additional interest to, if they do not explain, the words that follow - <span class="cmt_word">when he came from Padan-aram</span> (as Abraham previously had done); <span class="cmt_word">and</span> (he) <span class="cmt_word">pitched his tent before the city</span> - because he did not wish to come in contact with the inhabitants (Lyre), or because his flocks and herds could not find accommodation within the city walls (Murphy), or perhaps simply for convenience of pasturage (Patrick). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:17-20 Jacob did not content himself with words of thanks for God's favour to him, but gave real thanks. Also he kept up religion, and the worship of God in his family. Where we have a tent, God must have an altar. Jacob dedicated this altar to the honour of El-elohe-Israel, God, the God of Israel; to the honour of God, the only living and true God; and to the honour of the God of Israel, as a God in covenant with him. Israel's God is Israel's glory. Blessed be his name, he is still the mighty God, the God of Israel. May we praise his name, and rejoice in his love, through our pilgrimage here on earth, and for ever in the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
