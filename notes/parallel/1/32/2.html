Mahanaim, afterwards a distinguished city in the territory of Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), and frequently referred to in subsequent Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>; 27; 19:32; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-14.htm">1 Kings 4:14</a>), as well as mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 7.9, 8), as a strong and beautiful city, has been identified with Mahneh, a deserted ruin six or seven miles north-west by north of Ajlun (Mount Gilead), and about twenty miles from the Jabbok (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Robinson,' vol. 3. App. 166; and cf. Tristram, 'The Land of Israel, p. 483); but the narrative appears to say that Mahanaim lay not north of Ga-leed, but between that place and Jabbok. Hence Porter suggests Gerasa, the most splendid ruin east of the Jordan, and bordering on the Jabbok, as occupying the site of Mahanaim (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kitto s 'Cyclopedia,' art. Mahanaim, and cf. 'Handbook for S. and P.' 2. 311, seq.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-8 The angels of God appeared to Jacob, to encourage him with the assurance of the Divine protection. When God designs his people for great trials, he prepares them by great comforts. While Jacob, to whom the promise belonged, had been in hard service, Esau was become a prince. Jacob sent a message, showing that he did not insist upon the birth-right. Yielding pacifies great offences, Ec 10:4. We must not refuse to speak respectfully, even to those unjustly angry with us. Jacob received an account of Esau's warlike preparations against him, and was greatly afraid. A lively sense of danger, and quickening fear arising from it, may be found united with humble confidence in God's power and promise.</body></html>
