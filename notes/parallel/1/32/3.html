These, as we have seen on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm" title="And the Horites in their mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.">Genesis 14:6</a>, were a miserable race of cave-men, utterly unable to cope with Esau and his trained servants.

He seems also to have taken a Horite wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-5.htm" title="And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born to him in the land of Canaan.">Genesis 36:5</a>), and being thus connected with the country, upon Isaac's death he willingly removed into it, and it then became "the country," Heb. <span class= "ital">the field of Edom. </span>Its other name, <span class= "ital">Seir, i.e. </span>rough, hairy, shows that it was then covered with forests, and the term <span class= "ital">field </span>that it was an uncultivated region. It was entirely in the spirit of the adventurous Esau to make this expedition, and on his father's death to prefer this wild land to the peaceful pastures at Hebron, where he was surrounded by powerful tribes of Amorites and Hittites. The land of Seir was a hundred miles distant from Mahanaim, but Esau apparently had been moving up through what were afterwards the countries of Moab and Ammon, and was probably, when Jacob sent his messengers, at no very great distance. At all events, Jacob remained at Mahanaim till his brother was near, when he crossed the brook Jabbok, and went to meet him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob sent messengers</span> (with the messengers of Jacob, the messengers of Elohim form a contrast which can scarcely have been accidental) <span class="cmt_word">before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir</span>, - <span class="accented">vide</span> on Genesis 14:6.

Jacob sent a message, showing that he did not insist upon the birth-right. Yielding pacifies great offences, Ec 10:4. We must not refuse to speak respectfully, even to those unjustly angry with us. Jacob received an account of Esau's warlike preparations against him, and was greatly afraid. A lively sense of danger, and quickening fear arising from it, may be found united with humble confidence in God's power and promise.</body></html>
