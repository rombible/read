it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he</span> (Jacob) <span class="cmt_word">is behind us. And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him</span> - literally, <span class="accented">in your finding of him</span>. <span class="accented">And</span> say ye (literally, <span class="accented">and ye shall say</span>) moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is Behind us" for he thought that this would convince Esau that he Went to 'meet him with complete confidence, and without apprehension" (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">for he said</span> (the historian adds the motive which explained Jacob's singular behavior), <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">will appease him</span> (literally, I <span class="accented">will cover his face</span>, meaning I will prevent him from seeing my past offences, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. I will turn away his anger or pacify him, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-14.htm">Proverbs 16:14</a>) <span class="cmt_word">with the present that goeth before me,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">going before my face</span>. So Abigail appeased David with a present (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18-32</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me</span> - literally, <span class="accented">lift up my face</span>; a proverbial expression for granting a favorable reception (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>). "Jacob did not miscalculate the influence of his princely offerings, and I verily believe there is not an emeer or sheikh in all Gilead at this day who would not be appeased by such presents; and from my personal knowledge of Orientals, I should say that Jacob need not have been in such great terror, following in their rear. Far less will now 'make room,' as Solomon says, for any offender, however atrocious, and bring him before great men with acceptance" ('Land and Book,' p. 371). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:9-23 Times of fear should be times of prayer: whatever causes fear, should drive us to our knees, to our God. Jacob had lately seen his guards of angels, but in this distress he applied to God, not to them; he knew they were his fellow-servants, Re 22:9. There cannot be a better pattern for true prayer than this. Here is a thankful acknowledgement of former undeserved favours; a humble confession of unworthiness; a plain statement of his fears and distress; a full reference of the whole affair to the Lord, and resting all his hopes on him. The best we can say to God in prayer, is what he has said to us. Thus he made the name of the Lord his strong tower, and could not but be safe. Jacob's fear did not make him sink into despair, nor did his prayer make him presume upon God's mercy, without the use of means. God answers prayers by teaching us to order our affairs aright. To pacify Esau, Jacob sent him a present. We must not despair of reconciling ourselves to those most angry against us.</body></html>
