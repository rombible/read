Having emigrated from Mesopotamia in obedience to a call of Heaven, not without a like instruction were they at liberty to return - <span class="cmt_word">and who spake unto me,</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> honored me with Divine communications (vide <span class="accented">supra</span>) <span class="accented">- and</span> (in particular) <span class="cmt_word">that sware unto me,</span> - <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17, 18</a>; the covenant transaction therein recorded having all the force of an oath (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land</span>. Here was a second consideration that negatived the idea of Isaac's return, - he was the God-appointed heir of the soil, - and from this, in conjunction with the former, he argued that the Divine promise was certain of fulfillment, and that accordingly the mission for a bride would be successful. <span class="cmt_word">He shall send his angel before thee,</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to lead and protect, as was afterwards promised to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>), and to the Christian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and thou shalt take a wife unto my Ben from thence</span> (meaning, thy mission shall be successful). <span class="cmt_word">And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then shalt thou be clear of this my oath</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> at liberty to bold thyself as no longer under obligation in the matter; thy responsibility will at that point cease and determine): <span class="cmt_word">only bring not my son thither again</span> - or, observing the order of the Hebrew words, <span class="accented">only my son bring not again to that place</span>; with almost feverish entreaty harping on the solemn refrain that on no account must Isaac leave the promised land, since in that would be the culmination of unbelief and disobedience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 The effect of good example, good teaching, and the worship of God in a family, will generally appear in the piety, faithfulness, prudence, and affection of the servants. To live in such families, or to have such servants, both are blessings from God which should be highly valued, and thankfully acknowledged. But no concern in life is of greater importance to ourselves, to others, or to the church of God, than marriage. It therefore ought always to be undertaken with much care and prudence, especially with reference to the will of God, and with prayer for his direction and blessing. Where good parents are not consulted and regarded, the blessing of God cannot be expected. Parents, in disposing of their children, should carefully consult the welfare of their souls, and their furtherance in the way to heaven. Observe the charge Abraham gave to a good servant, one whose conduct, faithfulness, and affection, to him and his family, he had long known. Observe also, that Abraham remembers that God had wonderfully brought him out of the land of his birth, by the call of his grace; and therefore doubts not but He will prosper his care, not to bring his son thither again. God will cause that to end in our comfort, in which we sincerely aim at his glory.</body></html>
