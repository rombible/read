The journey of the servant would take some months, and during this time Abraham's herds would be shifted from station to station, but it would be known where he was from the period of the year. As Isaac was at the station most remote from Charran, Rebekah would have visited all his homes before arriving at Beer-lahai-roi.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 62.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (when the bridal train was nearing home) <span class="cmt_word">Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi</span>; - Hagar's well (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7, 14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">for he dwelt in the south country</span> - on the Negeb (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-9.htm">Genesis 12:9</a>). Abraham may by this time have removed from Hebron; or, if Hebron be included in the south country, Isaac may have been only on a visit to Hagar's well (Lange). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:54-67 Abraham's servant, as one that chose his work before his pleasure, was for hastening home. Lingering and loitering no way become a wise and good man who is faithful to his duty. As children ought not to marry without their parents' consent, so parents ought not to marry them without their own. Rebekah consented, not only to go, but to go at once. The goodness of Rebekah's character shows there was nothing wrong in her answer, though it be not agreeable to modern customs among us. We may hope that she had such an idea of the religion and godliness in the family she was to go to, as made her willing to forget her own people and her father's house. Her friends dismiss her with suitable attendants, and with hearty good wishes. They blessed Rebekah. When our relations are entering into a new condition, we ought by prayer to commend them to the blessing and grace of God. Isaac was well employed when he met Rebekah. He went out to take the advantage of a silent evening, and a solitary place, for meditation and prayer; those divine exercises by which we converse with God and our own hearts. Holy souls love retirement; it will do us good to be often alone, if rightly employed; and we are never less alone than when alone. Observe what an affectionate son Isaac was: it was about three years since his mother died, and yet he was not, till now, comforted. See also what an affectionate husband he was to his wife. Dutiful sons promise fair to be affectionate husbands; he that fills up his first station in life with honour, is likely to do the same in those that follow.</body></html>
