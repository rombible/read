It was hung not from the central cartilage of the nose, but from the left nostril, the flesh of which was pierced for the purpose; and such rings are still the usual betrothal present in Arabia, and are commonly worn both there and in Persia, made not only of gold and of silver but of coral, mother-of-pearl, and even cheaper materials. (See Quotation in Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-16.htm" title="And the damsel was very fair to look on, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.">Genesis 24:16</a>.) Its weight, about a quarter of an ounce, would make it not more disfiguring than many of the personal ornaments worn at the present time.<p>Bracelets are profusely worn at this day by Oriental women, the whole arm to the elbow being usually covered by them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking</span>, - "If it is remembered that camels, though endowed in an almost marvelous degree with the power of enduring thirst, drink, when an opportunity offers, an enormous quantity of water, it will be acknowledged that the trouble to which the maiden cheerfully submitted required more than ordinary, patience" (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight</span>, - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, was neither a pendant for the ear (LXX., Vulgate) nor a jewel for the forehead (A.V., margin), but a ring for the nose (ver. 47), the side cartilage, and sometimes the central wall, of which was pierced for the purpose of admitting it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11, 12</a>). Such rings are still worn by Oriental women, and in particular "the nose-ring is now the usual engagement present among the Bedouins" (Delitzsch). The weight of that presented to Rebekah was one <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, or half (<span class="accented">sc</span>. shekel), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, to divide - <span class="cmt_word">and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;</span> - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to bind or fasten, meant a circle of gold for the wrist or arm. So favorite an ornament is this of Oriental ladies, that sometimes the whole arm from wrist to elbow is covered with them; some- times two or more are worn one above the other; and not infrequently are they so numerous and heavy as almost to appear burdensome to the fair owners (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and said, Whose daughter art thou! tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?</span> The production of the bridal presents, and the tenor of the old man's inquiries, indicate that already he entertained the belief that he looked upon the object of his search. All dubiety was dispelled by Rebekah's answer. <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah,</span> - to show that she was not descended from Nahor's concubine (cf. ver. 15) - <span class="cmt_word">which she bare unto Nahor</span>. This appears to have been the stage at which the jewels were presented (ver. 47). <span class="cmt_word">She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in</span>. It was now conclusively determined, by her answering all the pre-arranged criteria, that the Lord had heard his prayer and prospered his way, and that the heaven-appointed bride stood before him. <span class="cmt_word">And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord.</span> The first verb expressing reverent inclination of the head, and the second complete prostration of the body, and both combining "to indicate the aged servant's deep thankfulness for the guidance of the Lord." <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham</span> (on the import of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5da;</span> <span class="accented">vide</span> Genesis 2:26), <span class="cmt_word">who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:</span> - literally, <span class="accented">who hath not taken away his grace</span> (<span class="accented">i.e</span>. the free favor which bestows) <span class="accented">and ale truth</span> (<span class="accented">i.e</span>. the faithfulness which implements promises) <span class="accented">from</span> ( = from the house of, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8, 25, 26</a>; Gesenius) <span class="accented">my master</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">I being in the way, the Lord led</span> (or, hath led) <span class="cmt_word">me to the house of my master's brethren.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:10-28 Abraham's servant devoutly acknowledged God. We have leave to be particular in recommending our affairs to the care of Divine providence. He proposes a sign, not that he intended to proceed no further, if not gratified in it; but it is a prayer that God would provide a good wife for his young master; and that was a good prayer. She should be simple, industrious, humble, cheerful, serviceable, and hospitable. Whatever may be the fashion, common sense, as well as piety, tells us, these are the proper qualifications for a wife and mother; for one who is to be a companion to her husband, the manager of domestic concerns, and trusted to form the minds of children. When the steward came to seek a wife for his master, he did not go to places of amusement and sinful pleasure, and pray that he might meet one there, but to the well of water, expecting to find one there employed aright. He prayed that God would please to make his way in this matter plain and clear before him. Our times are in God's hand; not only events themselves, but the times of them. We must take heed of being over-bold in urging what God should do, lest the event should weaken our faith, rather than strengthen it. But God owned him by making his way clear. Rebekah, in all respects, answered the characters he sought for in the woman that was to be his master's wife. When she came to the well, she went down and filled her pitcher, and came up to go home with it. She did not stand to gaze upon the strange man his camels, but minded her business, and would not have been diverted from it but by an opportunity of doing good. She did not curiously or confidently enter into discourse with him, but answered him modestly. Being satisfied that the Lord had heard his prayer, he gave the damsel some ornaments worn in eastern countries; asking at the same time respecting her kindred. On learning that she was of his master's relations, he bowed down his head and worshipped, blessing God. His words were addressed to the Lord, but being spoken in the hearing of Rebekah, she could perceive who he was, and whence he came.</body></html>
