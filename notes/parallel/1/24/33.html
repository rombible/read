the second, that consequently he will concede anything rather than have his hospitality refused. Aware of this feeling, Abraham's servant will not partake of Laban's bread and salt until he has told his request. After he had become Laban's guest, Laban would have been free to do as he liked; but he must now grant what is asked, or the stranger would decline <span class= "ital">to </span>enter his dwelling.<p>Mr. Fraser (<span class= "ital">Historical Description of Afghanistan </span>Genesis 11 p. 424: Edinburgh, 1834) and Ferrier (<span class= "ital">L'Af ghanistan, </span>Genesis 11, p. 119: ed. 1842) mention a remarkable custom connected with Afghan hospitality which admirably illustrates the behaviour of Abraham's servant. It is called <span class= "ital">menawati, </span>from two words signifying <span class= "ital">I am come in. </span>Any one who has a favour to ask goes to the tent or house of the person from whom he expects it, but refuses to sit on his carpet or partake of his food until he has granted the required boon. And custom makes it a point of honour to concede it, if it be in the power of the person thus appealed to.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was set</span> <span class="accented">- appositus</span> eat (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. if the first word be taken, as in the Keri, as the hophal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>; but if the Kethib be preferred, then <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> is the fur.

We are to notice God's providence in the common events of human life, and in them to exercise prudence and other graces. Laban went to ask Abraham's servant in, but not till he saw the ear-ring, and bracelet upon his sister's hands. We know Laban's character, by his conduct afterwards, and may think that he would not have been so free to entertain him, if he had not hoped to be well rewarded for it. The servant was intent upon his business. Though he was come off a journey, and come to a good house, he would not eat till he had told his errand. The doing our work, and the fulfilling our trusts, either for God or man, should be preferred by us before our food: it was our Saviour's meat and drink, Joh 4:34. He tells them the charge his master had given him, with the reason of it. He relates what had happened at the well, to further the proposal, plainly showing the finger of God in it. Those events which to us seem the effect of choice, contrivance, or chance, are appointed out of God. This hinders not, but rather encourages the use of all proper means. They freely and cheerfully close with the proposal; and any matter is likely to be comfortable, when it proceeds from the Lord. Abraham's servant thankfully acknowledges the good success he had met with. He was a humble man, and humble men are not ashamed to own their situation in life, whatever it may be. All our temporal concerns are sweet if intermixed with godliness.</body></html>
