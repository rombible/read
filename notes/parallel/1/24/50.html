Even when thus tardily mentioned, the father is placed after the brother; and of this we need look for no further explanation than that by polygamy the father was estranged from his own children, while each separate family held very closely together. Thus when Dinah was wronged, it was two of her mother's sons, Simeon and Levi, who avenged her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/34-13.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:">Genesis 34:13-25</a>); and so it was Absalom who avenged Tamar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-22.htm" title="And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.">2Samuel 13:22</a>). Still, Bethuel's consent was finally necessary; but as soon as it was given all active arrangements were left to the mother and Laban (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/24-53.htm" title="And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.">Genesis 24:53-55</a>), and Bethuel is mentioned no more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50-52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Laban and Bethuel</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 29) <span class="cmt_word">answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord</span>: <span class="accented">- Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 31) - <span class="cmt_word">we cannot speak unto thee bad or good</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they could not demur to a proposal so clearly indicated by Divine providence; a proof of the underlying piety of those descendants of Nahor. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go,</span> - that the consent of the maiden is not asked was not owing to the fact that, according to ancient custom, Oriental women were at the absolute disposal, in respect of marriage, of their parents and elder brothers (Bush), but to the circumstance that already it had been tacitly given by her acceptance of the bridal presents (Kalisch), or, from her amiable and pious disposition, might be taken for granted, since she, no more than they, would resist the clearly-revealed will of Jehovah (Lange, Wordsworth) - <span class="cmt_word">and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken.</span> Words which again kindled the flame of reverential piety in the old man's heart, so that <span class="cmt_word">he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth</span> - literally, <span class="accented">he prostrated himself to the earth to Jehovah</span> (cf. ver. 26). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:29-53 The making up of the marriage between Isaac and Rebekah is told very particularly. We are to notice God's providence in the common events of human life, and in them to exercise prudence and other graces. Laban went to ask Abraham's servant in, but not till he saw the ear-ring, and bracelet upon his sister's hands. We know Laban's character, by his conduct afterwards, and may think that he would not have been so free to entertain him, if he had not hoped to be well rewarded for it. The servant was intent upon his business. Though he was come off a journey, and come to a good house, he would not eat till he had told his errand. The doing our work, and the fulfilling our trusts, either for God or man, should be preferred by us before our food: it was our Saviour's meat and drink, Joh 4:34. He tells them the charge his master had given him, with the reason of it. He relates what had happened at the well, to further the proposal, plainly showing the finger of God in it. Those events which to us seem the effect of choice, contrivance, or chance, are appointed out of God. This hinders not, but rather encourages the use of all proper means. They freely and cheerfully close with the proposal; and any matter is likely to be comfortable, when it proceeds from the Lord. Abraham's servant thankfully acknowledges the good success he had met with. He was a humble man, and humble men are not ashamed to own their situation in life, whatever it may be. All our temporal concerns are sweet if intermixed with godliness.</body></html>
