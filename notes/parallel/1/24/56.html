When consulted she expressed her readiness at once to accompany the venerable messenger to his distant home; and accordingly, without more delay, she was dismissed from her mother's tent, attended by a faithful nurse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>) and enriched by the blessing of her pious relatives, who said unto her, <span class="cmt_word">Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions</span> (literally, <span class="accented">our sister</span> <span class="accented">thou</span>, <span class="accented">become to thousands of myriads</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let thy descendants be very numerous), and let thy seed possess the gate (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) of those which hate them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 24:61-67 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:54-67 Abraham's servant, as one that chose his work before his pleasure, was for hastening home. Lingering and loitering no way become a wise and good man who is faithful to his duty. As children ought not to marry without their parents' consent, so parents ought not to marry them without their own. Rebekah consented, not only to go, but to go at once. The goodness of Rebekah's character shows there was nothing wrong in her answer, though it be not agreeable to modern customs among us. We may hope that she had such an idea of the religion and godliness in the family she was to go to, as made her willing to forget her own people and her father's house. Her friends dismiss her with suitable attendants, and with hearty good wishes. They blessed Rebekah. When our relations are entering into a new condition, we ought by prayer to commend them to the blessing and grace of God. Isaac was well employed when he met Rebekah. He went out to take the advantage of a silent evening, and a solitary place, for meditation and prayer; those divine exercises by which we converse with God and our own hearts. Holy souls love retirement; it will do us good to be often alone, if rightly employed; and we are never less alone than when alone. Observe what an affectionate son Isaac was: it was about three years since his mother died, and yet he was not, till now, comforted. See also what an affectionate husband he was to his wife. Dutiful sons promise fair to be affectionate husbands; he that fills up his first station in life with honour, is likely to do the same in those that follow.</body></html>
