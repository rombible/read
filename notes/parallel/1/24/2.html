and though one holding so confidential a post would be a man of ripe years, yet it is not probable that Abraham would send any one who was not still vigorous on so distant a journey. Eliezer of Damascus had held a similar office fifty-five years previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>), but this was probably a younger man.<p><span class= "bld">Put </span>. . . <span class= "bld">thy hand under my thigh.</span>--As Jacob requires that Joseph should swear to him in the same manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-29.htm" title="And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:">Genesis 47:29</a>), this form of oath was evidently regarded as a very solemn one. The meaning of it has been much discussed, but we find the thigh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-26.htm" title="All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were three score and six;">Genesis 46:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-5.htm" title="And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.">Exodus 1:5</a>--in both which places it is rendered <span class= "ital">loins</span>--used as the source of posterity. Probably, therefore, as Tuch argues, it is an euphemistic manner of describing the circumcised member, which was to be touched by the hand placed bene<span class= "bld">Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.</span>--The betrothal of Isaac and Rebekah is told with the utmost exactness of detail, because it contained two principles of primary importance to Abraham's posterity: the first, that they were not to allow themselves to be merged among the Canaanites, but remain a distinct people; for this intermarriage with women of their own race was only a means to an end, and not a binding law, to be observed for its own sake. And secondly, that under no circumstances might they return to Mesopotamia, but must cling devotedly to the land of which God had promised them the possession. We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-8.htm" title="And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.">Genesis 24:8</a> that this second point was regarded by Abraham as even more important than the first; and with reason. For the race might remain distinct even if Isaac took a woman of Palestine to wife, though there would be the risk of religious deterioration; but if they returned to Padanaram they were certain to be absorbed, and could look for no higher lot than that attained to by Laban's descendants.<p><span class= "bld">Land of my kindred.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">of my nativity; </span>and so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm" title="But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.">Genesis 24:4</a>. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a>.)

Eliezer of Damascus, upwards of half a century previous regarded as heir presumptive to Abraham's house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), is commonly considered the official meant, though the point is of no importance - <span class="cmt_word">Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make thee swear.</span> This ancient form of adjuration, which is mentioned again only in chap. 47:29, and to which nothing analogous can elsewhere be discovered, - the practice alleged to exist among the modern Egyptian Bedouins of placing the hand upon the <span class="accented">membrum virile</span> in solemn forms of asseveration not forming an exact parallel, was probably originated by the patriarch. The thigh, as the source of posterity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>), has been regarded as pointing to Abraham's future descendants (Keil, Kalisch, Lange), and in particular to Christ, the promised seed (Theodoret, Jerome, Augustine, Luther, Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth), and the oath to be equivalent to a swearing by him that was to come. By others the thigh has been viewed as euphemistically put for the generative organ, upon which the sign of circumcision was placed, and the oath as an adjuration by the sign of the covenant (Jonathan, Jarchi, Tuch). A third interpretation considers the thigh as symbolizing lordship or authority, and the placing of the hand under it as tantamount to an oath of fealty and allegiance to a superior (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Calvin, Murphy). Other explanations are modifications of the above. <span class="cmt_word">By the Lord</span> (<span class="accented">Jehovah</span>; since the marriage to which this solemn adjuration was preliminary was not an ordinary alliance, such as might have taken place under the providence of Elohim, but the wedding of the heir of the promise), <span class="cmt_word">the God of heaven, and the God of the earth</span> (a clause defining Jehovah as the supreme Lord of the universe, and therefore as the sole Arbiter of human destiny), <span class="cmt_word">that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son</span> - not investing him with authority to provide a wife for Isaac in the event of death carrying him (Abraham) off before his son's marriage, but simply explaining the negative side of the commission with which he was about to be entrusted. If it evinced Isaac's gentle disposition and submissive piety, that though forty years of age he neither thought of marriage, but mourned in devout contemplation for his mother (,Lange), nor offered resistance to his father s proposal, but suffered himself to be governed by a servant (Calvin), it was also quite in accordance with ancient practice that parents should dispose of their children in marriage (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.</span> Being prompted to this partly by that jealousy with which all pastoral tribes of Shemitie origin have been accustomed to guard the purity of their race by intermarriage (Dykes; cf. Thomson, 'Land and Book,' p. 591), and partly no doubt by his perception of the growing licentiousness of the Canaanites, as well as his knowledge of their predicted doom, though chiefly, it is probable, by a desire to preserve the purity of the promised seed. Intermarriage with the Canaanites was afterwards forbidden by the Mosaic legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (literally, for, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former thing must not be done because this must be done) <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt go unto my country</span> (not Ur of the Chaldees, but the region beyond the Euphrates generally), <span class="cmt_word">and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</span> Though enforced by religious considerations, this injunction to bring none but a relative for Isaac's bride "was in no sense a departure from established usages and social laws in regard to marriage" ('Land and Book,' p. 591). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 The effect of good example, good teaching, and the worship of God in a family, will generally appear in the piety, faithfulness, prudence, and affection of the servants. To live in such families, or to have such servants, both are blessings from God which should be highly valued, and thankfully acknowledged. But no concern in life is of greater importance to ourselves, to others, or to the church of God, than marriage. It therefore ought always to be undertaken with much care and prudence, especially with reference to the will of God, and with prayer for his direction and blessing. Where good parents are not consulted and regarded, the blessing of God cannot be expected. Parents, in disposing of their children, should carefully consult the welfare of their souls, and their furtherance in the way to heaven. Observe the charge Abraham gave to a good servant, one whose conduct, faithfulness, and affection, to him and his family, he had long known. Observe also, that Abraham remembers that God had wonderfully brought him out of the land of his birth, by the call of his grace; and therefore doubts not but He will prosper his care, not to bring his son thither again. God will cause that to end in our comfort, in which we sincerely aim at his glory.</body></html>
