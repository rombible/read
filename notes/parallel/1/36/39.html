The two letters r and <span class= "ital">d </span>are in Hebrew so much alike, that they are repeatedly confused with one another. As we have already observed (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-1.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.">Genesis 36:1</a>) he was probably alive when this catalogue of kings was drawn up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar</span> - Hadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-50.htm">1 Chronicles 1:50</a>) - rei<span class="cmt_word">gned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau</span>; - Pal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-50.htm">1 Chronicles 1:50</a>); "Bleating" (Gesenius), "Yawning" (Furst), with which accords <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span> (LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">and his wife's name was Mehetabel,</span> - "Whom God benefits" (<span class="accented">Gesenius</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">the daughter of Marred</span>, - "Pushing" (Gesenius) - <span class="cmt_word">the daughter of Mezahab</span> - "Water of Gold" (Gesenius). That the death of this king, which a later chronicler records (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>), is not here mentioned by the historian is commonly regarded (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick, Hengstenberg, Keil, Kalisch, <span class="accented">et alii</span>) as a proof that he was then alive, and that in fact he was the king of Edom to whom Moses sent ambassadors requesting permission to pass through the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-43 Esau and his descendants. - The registers in this chapter show the faithfulness of God to his promise to Abraham. Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage. Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind, and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children of God have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than mount Seir in possession.</body></html>
