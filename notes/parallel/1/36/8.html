The hills are of limestone, with masses here and there of basalt; and though large portions are so covered with stones as to be barren, the rest is moderately fertile, not indeed in corn, but in figs, pomegranates, and other fruits. The climate is pleasant, the heat in summer being moderated by cool winds, but the winters are cold. The border of it was distant only some fifty or sixty miles from Hebron, so that Esau's transference of himself thither was an easy matter. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-39.htm" title="And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;">Genesis 27:39</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a>): <span class="cmt_word">Esau is Edom</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>).

Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage. Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind, and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children of God have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than mount Seir in possession.</body></html>
