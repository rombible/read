But in the list given here, no king succeeds his father, and probably these were petty monarchs, who sprang up in various parts of the country during a long period of civil war, in which the Horites were finally as completely conquered as were the Canaanites in Palestine under the heavy hands of Saul and Solomon. In the time of the dukes, there were also Horite dukes of the race of Seir, ruling districts mixed up apparently with those governed by the descendants of Esau. But all these now disappear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these</span> (which follow) <span class="cmt_word">are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any</span> (literally, <span class="accented">before the reigning</span> of a) <span class="cmt_word">king over</span> (or, to) <span class="cmt_word">the children of Israel</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The reference to Israelitish kings in this place has been explained as an evidence of post-Mosaic authorship (Le Clerc, Bleek, Ewald, Bohlen, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), or at least as a later interpolation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-43.htm">1 Chronicles 1:43</a> (Kennicott, A. Clarke, Lange), but is sufficiently accounted for by remembering that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a> kings had been promised to Jacob, while the blessing pronounced on Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>) implied that in his line also should arise governors, the historian being understood to say that though the promised kings had not yet arisen in the line of Jacob, the house of Esau had attained at a somewhat early period to political importance (Calvin, Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, Gerlach, Havernick, and others). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The difficulty of finding room for the dukes (seven, four and three, all grandsons of Esau, vers. 15-19), the kings (eight in number, vers. 32-39), and again the dukes (in all eleven, vers. 40-43), that intervened between Esau and Moses disappears if the kings and dukes existed contemporaneously, of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>, as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14</a>, affords probable evidence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> As to the character of the Edomitish kings, it is apparent that it was not a hereditary monarchy, since in no case does the son succeed the father, but an elective sovereignty, the kings being chosen by the dukes, alluphim, or phylarchs (Keil, Hengstenberg, Kalisch, Gerlach), though the idea of successive usurpations (Lange) is not without a measure of probability. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-43 Esau and his descendants. - The registers in this chapter show the faithfulness of God to his promise to Abraham. Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage. Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind, and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children of God have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than mount Seir in possession.</body></html>
