When, then, he sees Jacob sent away to obtain a wife, in accordance with the rule established by Abraham, he determines also to conform to it, and marries a daughter of Ishmael. She is called Bashe-math in chap 36:3, and described in both places as "the sister of Nebajoth," in order to show that as Nebajoth "the firstborn" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a>) was undoubtedly the son of Ishmael by his first wife, "whom Hagar took for him out of the land of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm" title="And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.">Genesis 21:21</a>), so also Mahalath shared in this precedence, and was not the daughter of any of Ishmael's subsequent wives, or of a concubine.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">Esau saw that Issue had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">in his blessing</span> him (forming a parenthesis), <span class="accented">and he commanded him - <span class="cmt_word"></span>saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; and that</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone</span> (or went) <span class="cmt_word">to Padan-aram; and Esau seeing that</span> (more correctly, <span class="accented">saw that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the daughters of Canaan pleased not</span> (literally, <span class="accented">were evil in the eyes of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Isaac his father; then</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>went Esau unto Ishmael</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the family or tribe of Ishmael, aiming in this likely to please his father), <span class="cmt_word">and took unto the wives which he had</span> (so that they were neither dead nor divorced) <span class="cmt_word">Mahalath</span> (called Bashemath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-3.htm">Genesis 36:3</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the daughter of Ishmael</span> (and therefore Esau's half-cousin by the father's side, Ishmael, who was now dead thirteen years, having been Isaac's half-brother) <span class="cmt_word">Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth,</span> - Ishmael's firstborn (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to be his wife.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:10-22 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:6-9 Good examples impress even the profane and malicious.
