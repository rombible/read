For plainly, Jacob and his attendants did not go inside the city, but slept on the open ground; and as they would carry their provisions with them, they would need no supplies from its Canaanite inhabitants. Probably at the time of Joshua's conquest Beth-el was rather a holy place than a town, and when Ephraim seized upon Luz and put the people to the sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-23.htm" title="And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)">Judges 1:23-25</a>), the victors transferred the name of Beth-el to it.

From the circumstances recorded in the narrative, Jacob called the spot where he slept (in the vicinity of Luz) Bethel - the designation afterwards extending to the town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-6.htm">Genesis 35:6</a>). Until the conquest both titles appear to have been used - Luz by the Canaanites, Bethel by the Israelites. When the conquest was completed the Hebrew name was substituted for the Hittite, the sole survivor of the captured city building another Luz in another part of the country (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-26.htm">Judges 1:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:16-19 God manifested himself and his favour, to Jacob, when he was asleep.

Wherever we are, in the city or in the desert, in the house or in the field, in the shop or in the street, we may keep up our intercourse with Heaven, if it is not our own fault. But the more we see of God, the more cause we see for holy trembling before him.</body></html>
