As it lay twelve miles north of Jerusalem, in the mountains of Ephraim, Jacob had already been at least four days on the route (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-4.htm" title="Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.">Genesis 22:4</a>); and though we are not to suppose that Isaac would send away the son who was heir of the blessing without a few trusty servants (nor does the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-10.htm" title="I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.">Genesis 32:10</a> require it), yet Jacob would none the less feel the solemnity of the journey, and the difficulties which surrounded him. Well may he have asked whether <span class= "ital">El Shaddai </span>would confirm him in the possession of that which he had defiled by fraud and cunning. And thus, meditating much and praying much, he had in those four days drawn near to God, and is at last accepted. The interest in Jacob's life lies in the gradual improvement and progress of his character. Religion was always a reality with him; but at first it was of a low type, and marred by duplicity and earthly scheming. His schemes succeed, but bring with them sorrow and trial; and trial purifies him, and gradually he advances into a region of unselfish and holy piety. Though to the last he was a man sagacious, and full of expedients, yet the nobler part of his character finally had the supremacy.<p><span class= "bld">He took of the stones. . . . --</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">he took one of the stones of the place, and put it as his bolster. </span>Jewish commentators identify the place with Mount Moriah, and say that the stone which Jacob placed under his head was one of those which had formed the altar upon which Isaac had been bound for sacrifice. The name Beth-el signified, they add, the temple, and as <span class= "ital">makom</span>--place--is thrice used in this verse, it mysteriously foreshadowed the three temples--Solomon's, Ze-rubbabel's, and Herod's--which successively occupied the site. More probably Beth-el was really the town of that name, and these explanations are allegorical rather than expository.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he lighted upon a certain place</span>, - literally, he <span class="accented">struck upon the place</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either the place best suited for him to rest in (Inglis), or the place appointed for him by God (Ainsworth, Bush), or more probably the well-known place afterwards mentioned (Keil, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Situated in the mountains of Ephraim, about three hours north of Jerusalem, it was not reached after one, but after several days' journey (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and tarried there all night, because the sun was set;</span> - being either remote from the city Luz when overtaken by darkness, or unwilling to enter the town; not because he hated the inhabitants (Josephus), but because he was a stranger - <span class="cmt_word">and he took of the stones of that place</span>, - i.e. one of the stones (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 18). "The track (of pilgrims) winds through an uneven valley, covered, as with gravestones, by large sheets of bare rock; some few here and there standing up like the cromlechs of Druidical monuments" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 219; cf. 'Lectures on Jewish Church,' p. 59) - <span class="cmt_word">and put them for his pillows,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and put for his head-bolster</span>, the word signifying that which is at the head of any one (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7, 11, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-6.htm">1 Kings 19:6</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and lay down in that place to sleep</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-5.htm">1 Samuel 3:5, 6, 9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:10-15 Jacob's conduct hitherto, as recorded, was not that of one who simply feared and trusted in God. But now in trouble, obliged to flee, he looked only to God to make him to dwell in safety, and he could lie down and sleep in the open air with his head upon a stone. Any true believer would be willing to take up with Jacob's pillow, provided he might have Jacob's vision. God's time to visit his people with his comforts, is, when they are most destitute of other comforts, and other comforters. Jacob saw a ladder which reached from earth to heaven, the angels going up and coming down, and God himself at the head of it. This represents, 1. The providence of God, by which there is a constant intercourse kept up between heaven and earth. This let Jacob know that he had both a good guide and a good guard. 2. The mediation of Christ. He is this ladder; the foot on earth in his human nature, the top in heaven in his Divine nature. Christ is the Way; all God's favours come to us, and all our services go to him, by Christ, Joh 1:51. By this way, sinners draw near to the throne of grace with acceptance. By faith we perceive this way, and in prayer we approach by it. In answer to prayer we receive all needful blessings of providence and grace. We have no way of getting to heaven but by Christ. And when the soul, by faith, can see these things, then every place will become pleasant, and every prospect joyful. He will never leave us, until his last promise is accomplished in our everlasting happiness. God now spake comfortably to Jacob. He spake from the head of the ladder. All the glad tidings we receive from heaven come through Jesus Christ. The Messiah should come from Jacob. Christ is the great blessing of the world. All that are blessed, are blessed in him, and none of any family are shut out from blessedness in him, but those that shut out themselves. Jacob had to fear danger from his brother Esau; but God promises to keep him. He had a long journey before him; to an unknown country; but, Behold, I am with thee, and God promises to bring him back again to this land. He seemed to be forsaken of all his friends; but God gives him this assurance, I will not leave thee. Whom God loves, he never leaves.</body></html>
