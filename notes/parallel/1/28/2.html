Throughout this verse Isaac shows a much more intimate acquaintance with the family at Haran than was possessed by Abraham. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm" title="But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.">Genesis 24:4</a>.) And though we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-5.htm" title="And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.">Genesis 28:5</a> that Bethuel was now dead, yet it is evident that he was a person of more importance than is supposed by the Rabbins, who ascribe to his feebleness or death the prominent part taken by Laban in his sister's marriage. It was this greater knowledge which made Isaac send Jacob in person, and not a deputy. With a few trusty attendants he would journey till he reached the usual caravan route which led through Damascus to Haran. and would then attach himself to some trading company for escort and society.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise, go to Padan-aram</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-10.htm">Genesis 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-43.htm">Genesis 27:43</a>), <span class="cmt_word">to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father</span>; - (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-24.htm">Genesis 14:24</a>).

Probably he saw that Jacob could attend to that business sufficiently without assistance from others - <span class="cmt_word">of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Genesis 14:29). "Isaac appears to entertain no doubt of Jacob's success, which might be the more probable since the same reason which kept Jacob from marrying in Canaan might prevent Laban's daughters from being married in Haran, the worshippers of the Lord being few (Inglis). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 Jacob had blessings promised both as to this world and that which is to come; yet goes out to a hard service. This corrected him for the fraud on his father. The blessing shall be conferred on him, yet he shall smart for the indirect course taken to obtain it. Jacob is dismissed by his father with a solemn charge. He must not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan: those who profess religion, should not marry with those that care not for religion. Also with a solemn blessing. Isaac had before blessed him unwittingly; now he does it designedly. This blessing is more full than the former; it is a gospel blessing. This promise looks as high as heaven, of which Canaan was a type. That was the better country which Jacob and the other patriarchs had in view.</body></html>
