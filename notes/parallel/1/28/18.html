But besides its use as a memorial, it would enable him to identify the place upon his return, and pay there his vows. And as oil was the symbol of the dedication of a thing to holy uses, he pours oil upon the top of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob rose up early in the morning</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and took the stone that he had put for his pillows</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and set it up for a pillar</span> - literally, <span class="accented">set it up</span>, <span class="accented">a pillar</span> (or something set upright, hence a statue or monument); not as an object of worship, a sort of fetish, but as a memorial of the vision (Calvin, Keil, Murphy; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-45.htm">Genesis 31:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9, 20</a>; 14:26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and poured oil upon the top of it.</span> <span class="accented">Quasi signum consecrationis</span> (Calvin), and not because he regarded it as in itself invested with any degree of sanctity. The worship of sacred stones (Baetylia), afterwards prevalent among the Greeks, Romans, Hindoos, Arabs, and Germans, though by some (Kuenen, Oort; <span class="accented">vide</span> 'The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 231) regarded as one of the primeval forms of worship among the Hebrews, was expressly interdicted by the law of Moses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-22.htm">Deuteronomy 16:22</a>). It was probably a heathen imitation of the rite here recorded, though by some authorities (Keil, Knobel, Lange) the Baetylian worship is said to have been connected chiefly with meteoric stones which were supposed to have descended from some divinity; as, e. g., the stone in Delphi sacred to Apollo; that in Emesa, on the Orontes, consecrated to the sun; the angular rock at Pessinus in Phrygia worshipped as hallowed by Cybele; the black stone in the Kaaba at Mecca believed to have been brought from heaven by the angel Gabriel (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kalisch in /Gee). That the present narrative was a late invention, "called into existence by a desire" on the part of the priests and prophets of Yahweh (Jehovah) "<span class="accented">to</span> proclaim the high antiquity of the sanctuary at Bethel, and to make a sacred stone harmless" ('The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 231), is pure assumption. The circumstance that the usage here mentioned is nowhere else in Scripture countenanced (except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>, with reference to this same pillar) forms a sufficient pledge of the high antiquity of the narrative (<span class="accented">vied</span> Havernick's 'Introd.,' &sect; 20). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:16-19 God manifested himself and his favour, to Jacob, when he was asleep. The Spirit, like the wind, blows when and where it listeth, and God's grace, like the dew, tarrieth not for the sons of men. Jacob sought to improve the visit God had made him. Wherever we are, in the city or in the desert, in the house or in the field, in the shop or in the street, we may keep up our intercourse with Heaven, if it is not our own fault. But the more we see of God, the more cause we see for holy trembling before him.</body></html>
