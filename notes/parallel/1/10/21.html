In designating Shem as "the father of all the children of Eber," attention is called to the fact that the descendants of Peleg, his elder son, are omitted from this table, and reserved for the <span class= "ital">Toldoth Shem. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-10.htm" title="These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:">Genesis 11:10</a>.)<p>The nations descended from Shem were:--<p><span class= "bld">1. Elam.</span>--According to Mr. Sayce (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>p. 196), "the primitive inhabitants of Elam were a race closely allied to the Accadians, and spread over the whole range of country which stretched from the southern shores of the Caspian to the Persian Gulf." But just as the Semitic Asshur expelled a Hamite race from Assyria, so another branch of this conquering family occupied Elymais. It is now called Chuzistan, and was the most easternly of the countries occupied by the Semites. But see Excursus to Genesis 14 on the conquests of the Elamite Chedorlaomer.<p><span class= "bld">2. Asshur.</span>--This Semitic stock seems to have been the first to settle on the Tigris, as the Hamites were the first to settle on the Euphrates. Finally, as we have seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm" title="Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,">Genesis 10:11</a>), they conquered the whole country.<p><span class= "bld">3. Arphaxad.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Arpachshad. </span>We may dismiss the idea that he was connected with the region called Arrapachitis, for this correctly is Aryapakshata, "the land next the Aryans." Really he appears as the ancestor of Eber and the Joktanite Arabs.<p><span class= "bld">4. Lud.</span>--Probably the Lydians, who, after various wanderings, settled in Asia Minor.<p><span class= "bld">5. Aram.</span>--As Asshur means <span class= "ital">plain, </span>so Aram means <span class= "ital">highland. </span>It was originally the name of the Lebanon ranges, and thus Damascus is called Aram in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.">2Samuel 8:5</a>. Subsequently the race so extended itself as to possess Mesopotamia, a lowland country, but called, as early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>, "Aram of the two rivers." The greatness of Aram will be best seen by examining those places in our version where <span class= "ital">Syria and Syrian </span>are spoken of, and which, in the Hebrew, are really Aram.<p>To the Aramaean stock belonged also four outlying dependencies--(1) Uz, the land of Job, a district in the northern part of Arabia Deserta; (2) Hul and (3) Gether, regions of which nothing is known; and (4) Mash, a desert region on the western side of the Euphrates (<span class= "ital">Chald.

Those that are under the curse of God, may, perhaps, thrive and prosper in this world; for we cannot know love or hatred, the blessing or the curse, by what is before us, but by what is within us. The curse of God always works really, and always terribly. Perhaps it is a secret curse, a curse to the soul, and does not work so that others can see it; or a slow curse, and does not work soon; but sinners are reserved by it for a day of wrath Canaan here has a better land than either Shem or Japheth, and yet they have a better lot, for they inherit the blessing. Abram and his seed, God's covenant people, descended from Eber, and from him were called Hebrews. How much better it is to be like Eber, the father of a family of saints and honest men, than the father of a family of hunters after power, worldly wealth, or vanities. Goodness is true greatness.</body></html>
