These are--<p><span class= "bld">1. Seba.</span>--The name at this time of an Arabian tribe, which subsequently migrated into Africa, and settled in Meroe, which, according to Josephus, still bore in his days this appellation. They also left their name on the eastern side of the Red Sea, not far to the north of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.<p><span class= "bld">2. Havilah, </span>upon the river Pison (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-11.htm" title="The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;">Genesis 2:11</a>), was undoubtedly a region of Arabia, situated probably upon the Persian Gulf. Havilah is again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm" title="And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.">Genesis 10:29</a>.<p><span class= "bld">3.

(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-26.htm" title="And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,">Genesis 10:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">4. Raamah, </span>on the Persian Gulf, was divided into Dedan upon the south-west and Sheba in the centre, while Havilah lay upon the north-west side. Of these, Sheba subsequently rose to fame as the kingdom of the Himyarite Arabs.<p><span class= "bld">5. Sabtechah.</span>--Apparently still more to the south of Dedan, but placed by some on the eastern side of the gulf.<p>Thus, then, at the time when this table was written the southern half of Arabia was Cushite, and a swarthy race of men is still found there, especially in Yemen and Hadramaut, far darker than the light brown Arabians. Migrating from place to place along the sea-shore, the passage of the Cushites into Nubia and Abyssinia was easy. But their chief home was, at this period, in Mesopotamia, and the cuneiform inscriptions have now revealed their long struggle there with men of the race of Shem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of Cush;</span> <span class="cmt_word">Seba</span>.

No nation but that of the Jews can be sure from which of these seventy it has come. The lists of names of fathers and sons were preserved of the Jews alone, for the sake of the Messiah.

All places beyond the sea from Judea are called isles, Jer 25:22. That promise, Isa 42:4, The isles shall wait for his law, speaks of the conversion of the gentiles to the faith of Christ.</body></html>
