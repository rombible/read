We have here nothing to do with Asshur the son of Shem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22</a>), but are occupied with Nimrod and the Hamites, who, after firmly establishing themselves in Babylonia, subsequently extended their influence northward. This is confirmed by the cuneiform inscriptions, which prove that the southern portion of Mesopotamia was the chief seat of the Accadians, while in Assyria they came at an early date into collision with the Shemites, who drove them back, and ultimately subjugated them everywhere. It is not necessary to suppose that this spread of Hamite civilisation northward was the work of Nimrod personally; if done by his successors, it would, in Biblical language, be ascribed to its prime mover.<p>The Assyrian cities were:--<p><span class= "bld">1. Nineveh.</span>--So happily situated on the Tigris that it outstripped the more ancient Babylon, and for centuries even held it in subjection.<span class= "bld"><p>2. The City Rehoboth.</span>--Translated by some <span class= "ital">Rehoboth-Ir, </span>but with more probability by others, "the suburbs of the city:" that is, of Nineveh, thus denoting already the greatness of that town.<p><span class= "bld">3. Calah.</span>--A city rebuilt by Assur-natzir-pal, the father of Shalmaneser, and interesting as one of the places where the Assyrian kings established libraries (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>p. 26). The ruins are still called Nimroud.<p><span class= "bld">4. Resen.</span>--The "spring-head." Of this town nothing certain is known. Canon Rawlinson places it at Selamiyah (<span class= "ital">Anc. Mon., </span>1:204), a large village half-way between Nineveh and Calah. As the vast ruins scattered throughout Mesopotamia are those of Assyrian buildings, Resen, though "a great city" in Hamite times, might easily pass into oblivion, if never rebuilt by the conquerors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of that land went forth Asshur, the son of Shem</span> (ver. 22; LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, Luther, Calvin, Michaelis, Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bohlen). <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the early Assyrians retired from Babylon before their Cushite. invaders, and, proceeding northward, founded the cities after mentioned; but the marginal rendering seems preferable: "Out of that land went (Nimrod) into Asshur," or Assyria, the country northeast of Babylon, through which flows the Tigris, and which had already received its name from the son of Shem (the Targums, Drusius, Bochart, Le Clerc, De Wette, Delitzsch, Keil, Kalisch, Lange, <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">alii</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And builded Nineveh</span>. The capital of Assyria, opposite Mosul on the Tigris, afterwards became the largest and most flourishing city of the ancient world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>), being fifty-five miles in circumference (Diod., 2:3), and is now identified with the ruins of Nehbi-yunus and Kouyunjik (Layard's 'Nineveh,' vol 2. pp. 136 ft.). <span class="cmt_word">And the city Rehoboth</span>. <span class="accented">Rehoboth-ir</span>, literally, the streets of the city (cf. Platea, a city in Boeotia), a town of which the site is unknown. <span class="cmt_word">And Calah</span>. The mounds of Nimroud (Layard and Smith), though Kalisch and Murphy prefer Kalah Shergat (about fifty miles south of Nineveh), which the former authorities identify with Asshur, the original capital of the country. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:8-14 Nimrod was a great man in his day; he began to be mighty in the earth, Those before him were content to be upon the same level with their neighbours, and though every man bare rule in his own house, yet no man pretended any further. Nimrod was resolved to lord it over his neighbours. The spirit of the giants before the flood, who became mighty men, and men of renown, Ge 6:4, revived in him. Nimrod was a great hunter. Hunting then was the method of preventing the hurtful increase of wild beasts. This required great courage and address, and thus gave an opportunity for Nimrod to command others, and gradually attached a number of men to one leader. From such a beginning, it is likely, that Nimrod began to rule, and to force others to submit. He invaded his neighbours' rights and properties, and persecuted innocent men; endeavouring to make all his own by force and violence. He carried on his oppressions and violence in defiance of God himself. Nimrod was a great ruler. Some way or other, by arts or arms, he got into power, and so founded a monarchy, which was the terror of the mighty, and bid fair to rule all the world. Nimrod was a great builder. Observe in Nimrod the nature of ambition. It is boundless; much would have more, and still cries, Give, give. It is restless; Nimrod, when he had four cities under his command, could not be content till he had four more. It is expensive; Nimrod will rather be at the charge of rearing cities, than not have the honour of ruling them. It is daring, and will stick at nothing. Nimrod's name signifies rebellion; tyrants to men are rebels to God. The days are coming, when conquerors will no longer be spoken of with praise, as in man's partial histories, but be branded with infamy, as in the impartial records of the Bible.</body></html>
