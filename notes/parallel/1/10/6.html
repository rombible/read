Japheth they connect with a word signifying <span class= "ital">to be fair; </span>and so Ham is the progenitor of dark races, Japheth of those of a fair complexion, while the olive- coloured spring from Shem. More probably it is <span class= "ital">Chemi, </span>the old name of Egypt, "the land of Ham" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-51.htm" title="And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:">Psalm 78:51</a>), called by Plutarch Chemia, and was taken from the <span class= "ital">black </span>colour of the soil.<p>The Hamites are grouped in four principal divisions:--<p><span class= "bld">1. Cush. </span>Aethiopia, but not that of Africa, but of Asia. The home of the Cushites was on the Tigris and Euphrates, where Nimrod raised them to great power. Thence they spread into the southern peninsula of Arabia, and crossing the Red Sea at a later date, colonised Nubia and Abyssinia. In the Bible Cush is watered by the Gihon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-13.htm" title="And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.">Genesis 2:13</a>); and Zipporah, the wife of Moses, and daughter of a priest of Midian, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm" title="And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.">Numbers 12:1</a> called a Cushite. Their high rank in old time is marked by the place held by them in the <span class= "ital">Iliad </span>of Homer.<span class= "bld"><p>2. Mizraim. </span>Egypt. In form the word is a dual, and may point to the division of the country into Upper and Lower Egypt. If we choose to interpret a Hamite word by a Hebrew root, it may signify the <span class= "ital">narrowed land, </span>but it is safer to leave these words till increased knowledge shall enable us to decide with some security upon their meaning. For the ancient name of Mizraim see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a>, and for its extent see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm" title="And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.">Genesis 10:14</a>. From the study of the skulls and bodies of a large number of mummies Brugsch-Bey in his recent history has come to the conclusion that the ancient Egyptians did not belong to any African race, but to the great Caucasian family, "but not of the Pelasgic or Semitic branches, but of a third, Cushite." He adds that the cradle of the Egyptian nation must be sought in Central Asia.<p><span class= "bld">3. Phut.</span> The Lybians of North Africa.<p><span class= "bld">4. Canaan.</span> See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/10-15.htm" title="And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,">Genesis 10:15-19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of Ham</span>. These, who occupy the second place, that the list might conclude with the Shemites as the line of promise, number thirty, of whom only four were immediate descendants. Their territory generally embraced the southern portions of the globe. Hence the name Ham has been connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>, to be warm, though Kalisch declares it to be not of Hebrew, but Egyptian origin, appearing in the Chme of the Rosetta Stone. The most usual ancient name of the country was Kern, the <span class="accented">black</span> land. Scripture speaks of Egypt as the land of Ham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-51.htm">Psalm 78:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-23.htm">Psalm 105:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-22.htm">Psalm 106:22</a>) <span class="cmt_word">Cush.</span> Ethiopia, including Arabia "quae mater est," and Abyssinia "quae colonia" (Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller). The original settlement of Cush, however, is believed to have been on the Upper Nile, whence he afterwards spread to Arabia, Babylonia, India (Knobel, Kalisch, Lange, Rawlinson). Murphy thinks he may have started from the Caucasus, the Caspian, and. the Cossaei of Khusistan, and. migrated south (to Egypt) and east (to India). Josephus mentions that in his day Ethiopia was called Cush; the Syriac translates <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>) by Cuschaeos; the ancient Egyptian name of Ethiopia was <span class="accented">Keesh</span>, Kish, or Kush ('Records of the Past, 4:7). The Cushites are described as of a black color (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>) and of great stature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Mizraim</span>. A dual form probably designed to represent the two Egypts, upper and lower (Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch), though it has been discovered in ancient Egyptian as the name of a Hittite chief (<span class="accented">circa</span> <span class="date">B.C. 1300</span>, contemporary with Rameses II.), written in hieroglyphics <span class="accented">M'azrima</span>, Ma being the sign for the dual. The old Egyptian name is <span class="accented">Kemi, Chemi</span>, with obvious reference to Ham; the name Egypt being probably derived from <span class="accented">Kaphtah</span>, the land of Ptah. The singular form Mazor is found in later books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>; 35:25), and usually denotes Lower Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">And Phut</span>. <span class="accented">Phet</span> (Old Egyptian), <span class="accented">Phaiat</span> (Coptic); the Libyans in the north of Africa (Josephus, LXX., Gesenins, Bochart). Kalisch suggests <span class="accented">Buto</span> or <span class="accented">Butos</span>, the capital of the delta of the Nile. And Canaan. Hebrew, <span class="accented">Kenaan</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on Genesis 9:25). The extent of the territory occupied by the fourth son of Ham is defined in vers. 15-19. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 This chapter shows concerning the three sons of Noah, that of them was the whole earth overspread. No nation but that of the Jews can be sure from which of these seventy it has come. The lists of names of fathers and sons were preserved of the Jews alone, for the sake of the Messiah. Many learned men, however, have, with some probability, shown which of the nations of the earth descended from each of the sons of Noah To the posterity of Japheth were allotted the isles of the gentiles; probably, the island of Britain among the rest. All places beyond the sea from Judea are called isles, Jer 25:22. That promise, Isa 42:4, The isles shall wait for his law, speaks of the conversion of the gentiles to the faith of Christ.</body></html>
