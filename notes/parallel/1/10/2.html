Gomer, </span>whose name reappears in the Cimmerians. Their original settlement was between Magog and Madai, that is, between the Scythians and the Medes. After remaining some time on the Caspian and Black Seas, on which latter they have left their name in the Crimea, a powerful branch of them struck across the centre of Russia, and, skirting the Baltic, became the Cimbri of Denmark (whence the name of the Chersonesus Cimbrica, given to Jutland), the Cymry of Wales, &c. Generally they are the race to which the " name is given of Celts.<p><span class= "bld">2. Magog. </span>The Scythians, who once possessed the country north and south of the Caucasus. The Russians are their modern representatives, being descended from the Sarmatians, a Scythic race, with a small admixture of Median blood.<p><span class= "bld">3. Madai. </span>The Medes, who dwelt to the south and south-west of the Caspian. <span class= "ital">Mada, </span>in the Accadian language, means <span class= "ital">land, </span>and it was in the Median territory that Kharsak-Kurra, "the mountain of the East," was situated, on which the Accadians believed the ark to have rested, whence possibly Media took its name, being "the land" above all others (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>p. 196).<p><span class= "bld">4. Javan, </span>that is, Ionia, the land of the Greeks.<p><span class= "bld">5. Tubal. </span>The Tibareni, on the south-east of the Black Sea.<p><span class= "bld">6. Meshech. </span>The Moschi, a people of Colchis and Armenia.<p><span class= "bld">7. Tiras. </span>According to Josephus and the Targum, the Thracians. Other races have been suggested, but this is probably right; and as the Getae, the ancestors of the Goths, were Thracians, this would make the Scandinavian race the modern representatives of Tiras.<p>In this enumeration the race of Japheth is described as occupying Asia Minor, Armenia, the countries to the west as far as the Caspian Sea, and thence northward to the shores of the Black Sea. Subsequently it spread along the northern shores of the Mediterranean and. over all Europe. But though unnoticed by the writer its extension was equally remarkable towards the east. Parthia, Bactria, the Punjab, India, are equally Japhethite with Germany, Greece, and Rome; and in Sanscrit literature the Aryan first showed that genius, which, omitting the greatest of all books, the Semitic Bible, has made this race the foremost writers in the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Japheth</span> are first mentioned not because Japheth was the eldest of the three brothers, although that was true, but because of the greater distance of the Japhetic tribes from the theocratic center, the Hamites having always been much more nearly situated to and closely connected with the Shemites than they. The immediate descendants of Japheth, whose name, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, occurs again in the mythology of a Japhetic race, were fourteen m number, seven sons and seven grandsons, each of which became the progenitor of one of the primitive nations. <span class="cmt_word">Gomer</span>. A people inhabiting "the sides of the north" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>); the Galatae of the Greeks (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 1:06); the Chomarii, a nation in Bactriana on the Oxus (Shulthess, Kalisch); but more generally the Cimmerians of Homer ('Odyss.,' 11:13-19), whose abodes were the shores of the Caspian and Euxine, whence they seem to have spread themselves over Europe as far west as the Atlantic, leaving traces of their presence in the Cimhri of North Germany and the Cymri in Wales (Keil, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary ). <span class="cmt_word">And Magog</span>. A fierce and warlike people presided over by Gog (an appellative name, like the titles Pharaoh and Caesar, and corresponding with the Turkish Chak, the Tartarian Kak, and the Mongolian Gog: Kalisch), whose complete destruction was predicted by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 38, 39.); generally understood to be the Scythians, whose territory lay upon the borders of the sea of Asoph, and in the Caucasus. In the Apocalypse (Revelation 20:8-10) Gog and Magog appear as two distinct nations combined against the Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">And Madai</span>. The inhabitants of Media (Mada in the cuneiform inscriptions), so called because believed to be situated <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (Polyb. 5:44) on the south-west shore of the Caspian <span class="cmt_word">And Javan</span>. Identical with <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (Greek), Javana (Sanscrit), Juna (Old Persian), Jounan (Rosetta Stone); allowed to be the father of the Greeks, who in Scripture are styled Javan (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-20.htm">Daniel 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm">Joel 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Tubal, and Meshech</span>. Generally associated in Scripture as tributaries of Magog (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a>); recognized as the Iberians and Moschi in the north of Armenia, between the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Black Sea (Josephus, Knobel, Lange, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And Tiras</span>. The ancestor of the Thraciaus (Josephus), of the Tyrrheni, a branch of the Pelasgians (Tuch), of the Asiatic tribes round the Taurus (Kalisch), in support of which last is a circumstance mentioned by Rawlinson, that on the old Egyptian monuments <span class="accented">Mashuash and Tuirash</span>, and upon the Assyrian <span class="accented">Tubal</span> and <span class="accented">Misek</span>, stand together as here. Tiras occurs nowhere else in Scripture. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 This chapter shows concerning the three sons of Noah, that of them was the whole earth overspread. No nation but that of the Jews can be sure from which of these seventy it has come. The lists of names of fathers and sons were preserved of the Jews alone, for the sake of the Messiah. Many learned men, however, have, with some probability, shown which of the nations of the earth descended from each of the sons of Noah To the posterity of Japheth were allotted the isles of the gentiles; probably, the island of Britain among the rest. All places beyond the sea from Judea are called isles, Jer 25:22. That promise, Isa 42:4, The isles shall wait for his law, speaks of the conversion of the gentiles to the faith of Christ.</body></html>
