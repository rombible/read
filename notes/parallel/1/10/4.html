Elishah, </span>a maritime people of Greece. Traces of the name occur in Aeolis and in Elis, a district of the Peloponessus. Some boldly identify with Hellas. The isles of Elishah are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm" title="Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered you.">Ezekiel 27:7</a>.<span class= "bld"><p>2. Tarshish. </span>At so early a period this could scarcely be Tartessus, but is more probably the Tyrseni, or Tyrrheni, a race once powerful in Italy, Corsica, Sardinia, and finally in Spain. Probably Tartessus, at the mouth of the Guadalquiver, in Spain, was founded by them, and took from them its name. At this time they; were apparently a small tribe of the Javanites; but while Elishah followed the sea-coast and colonised Greece, Tarshish took a course so far inland to the north of the Danube that it did not reach the sea until it had come to the northern districts of Italy.<p><span class= "bld">3. Kittim. </span>A plural, like Madai. The Kittim were a maritime race, who colonised Cyprus, the chief city of which was Kitium, and probably other islands and coast-districts of the Mediterranean. There was a Kitium also in Macedonia; and Alexander is called King of the Kittim in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-1.htm" title="And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first over Greece,">1 Maccabees 1:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">4. Dodanim. </span>Another plural. The right reading is probably Rodanim, as in many MSS. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-7.htm" title="And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.">1Chronicles 1:7</a> and in the LXX., and the Samaritan here. R and D are so constantly interchanged in proper names. owing to the similarity of their shape, that no dependence can be placed upon the reading. The Rodanim would be the Rhodians.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of Javan; Elizhah</span>. The isles of Elishah are praised by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>) for their blue and purple; supposed to have been Elis in the Peloponnesus, famous for its purple dyes (Bochart); AEolis (Josephus, Knobel); Hellas (Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch); without doubt a maritime people of Grecian stock ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">And Tarshish.</span> Tarsus in Cilicia (Josephus); but rather Tartessus in Spain (Eusehius, Michaelis, Bochart, Kalisch). Biblical notices represent Tarshish as a wealthy and flourishing seaport town towards the west (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Kittim</span>. Chittim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>); Citium in Cyprus (Josephus), though latterly the name appears to have been extended to Citium in Macedonia (Alexander the Great is called the king of Chittim, 1 Macc. 1:1 1 Macc. 8:5), and the colonies which settled on the shores of Italy and Greece (Bochart, Keil, Kalisch). <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> describe it as a maritime people. <span class="cmt_word">And Dodanim</span>. Dordona in Epirus (Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller); the Dardaniaus, or Trojan's (Gesenius); the Daunians of South Italy (Kalisch); the Rhodani in Gaul, reading as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-7.htm">1 Chronicles 1:7</a> (Bochart). Josephus omits the name, and Scripture does not again mention it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 This chapter shows concerning the three sons of Noah, that of them was the whole earth overspread. No nation but that of the Jews can be sure from which of these seventy it has come. The lists of names of fathers and sons were preserved of the Jews alone, for the sake of the Messiah. Many learned men, however, have, with some probability, shown which of the nations of the earth descended from each of the sons of Noah To the posterity of Japheth were allotted the isles of the gentiles; probably, the island of Britain among the rest. All places beyond the sea from Judea are called isles, Jer 25:22. That promise, Isa 42:4, The isles shall wait for his law, speaks of the conversion of the gentiles to the faith of Christ.</body></html>
