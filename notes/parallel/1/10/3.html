Ashkenaz</span>, a region in the neighbourhood of Armenia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27</a>), whence, following the course of Japhethite migration, the race seems to have wandered into Germany. The derivations are all most uncertain; but the Jews call the Germans Ashkenazites, and are probably right.<span class= "bld"><p>2. Riphath,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-6.htm" title="And the sons of Gomer; Ashchenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.">1Chronicles 1:6</a>, is called Diphath (see Dodanim, below). Riphath is probably right, and the, inhabitants of the Riphaean Mountains (the Carpathians?) are the people meant. They were Celts.<p><span class= "bld">3. Togarmah. </span>Certainly Armenia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of Gomer; Ash-kenaz</span>. Axenus, the ancient name of the Euxine, is supposed to favor Phrygia and Bithynia as the locality possessed by Aske-naz (Bochart); Iskus; equivalent to Ask, Ascanios, the oldest son of the Germanic Mannus, to point out Germany as his abode (Jewish commentators); but <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a> seems to indicate the region between the Euxine and the Caspian. Kalisch, following Josephus, identifies the name with the ancient town Rhagae, one day's journey to the south of the Caspian. Murphy and Peele, on the authority of Diodorus Siculus, believe the Germans may have been a colony of the Ashkenians. <span class="cmt_word">And Riphath</span>. Diphath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-6.htm">1 Chronicles 1:6</a>) - the Paphlagonians (Josephus); more generally the tribes about the Riphaean mountains, on the north of the Caspian (Knobel, Kalisch, Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy, ' Speaker's Commentary'); but both are uncertain (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">And Togarmah</span>. Mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>; the Phrygians (Josephus), the Cappadocians (Bochart), the Armenians (Michaelis, Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller), the Taurians, inhabiting the Crimea (Kalisch). The tradition preserved by Moses Chorensis, that the ancestor of the Armenians was the son of Thorgom, the son of Comer, is commonly regarded as deciding the question. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 This chapter shows concerning the three sons of Noah, that of them was the whole earth overspread. No nation but that of the Jews can be sure from which of these seventy it has come. The lists of names of fathers and sons were preserved of the Jews alone, for the sake of the Messiah. Many learned men, however, have, with some probability, shown which of the nations of the earth descended from each of the sons of Noah To the posterity of Japheth were allotted the isles of the gentiles; probably, the island of Britain among the rest. All places beyond the sea from Judea are called isles, Jer 25:22. That promise, Isa 42:4, The isles shall wait for his law, speaks of the conversion of the gentiles to the faith of Christ.</body></html>
