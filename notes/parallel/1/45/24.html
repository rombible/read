This is the meaning given to the passage in all the versions, and agrees with Joseph's efforts to quiet their fears, and convince them of his good intentions. Several modern commentators, however, translate "Be not afraid of the journey," but on insufficient grounds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - So (literally, and) he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> signifies to be moved or disturbed with any violent emotion, but in particular with anger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-9.htm">Proverbs 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-21.htm">Isaiah 28:21</a>; cf.

Egypt would make up the losses of their removal. Thus those for whom Christ intends his heavenly glory, ought not to regard the things of this world. The best of its enjoyments are but lumber; we cannot make sure of them while here, much less can we carry them away with us. Let us not set our eyes or hearts upon the world; there are better things for us in that blessed land, whither Christ, our Joseph, is gone to prepare a place. Joseph dismissed his brethren with a seasonable caution, See that ye fall not out by the way. He knew they were too apt to be quarrelsome; and having forgiven them all, he lays this charge upon them, not to upbraid one another. This command our Lord Jesus has given to us, that we love one another, and that whatever happens, or has happened, we fall not out. For we are brethren, we have all one Father. We are all guilty, and instead of quarrelling with one another, have reason to fall out with ourselves. We are, or hope to be, forgiven of God, whom we have all offended, and, therefore, should be ready to forgive one another. We are by the way, a way through the land of Egypt, where we have many eyes upon us, that seek advantage against us; a way that leads to the heavenly Canaan, where we hope to be for ever in perfect peace.</body></html>
