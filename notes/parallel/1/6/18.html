and though they had begun to attach the notion of Deity to the name Jehovah in the days of Enos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm" title="And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 4:26</a>), yet it was not till the time of Moses that it became the distinct title of God in covenant with man. Of this relation a necessary result was revelation, as in no other way could there be a communication between the two contracting parties. Hence the Bible is called "The Old and New Covenant," or "The Old and New Testament," the Greek term being of wider meaning than either word with us, and signifying either an agreement between the living or the document by which a testator disposes of his property after his death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16-17</a>). The title of covenant is more applicable to the Scriptures of the prior dispensation, which contain a series of such relations, all preparing for the last and best and most perfect, which was a Testament ratified in the blood of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But with thee will I establish my covenant</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">foe</span>-<span class="accented">due</span>, Vulgate; <span class="accented">testamentum</span>, N.T.), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span>, to cut or carve; hence a covenant, from the custom of passing between the divided pieces of the victims slain on the occasion of making such solemn compacts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9</a>; Gesenius); from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, to eat, hence an eating together, a banquet (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; Lee). On the Bible idea of covenant see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9</a>. My covenant = the already well-known covenant which I have made with man. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy son's wives with thee.</span> <span class="accented">This</span> was the substance of the covenant agreement so far as Noah was concerned. The next three verses describe the arrangements about the animals. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-21 God told Noah his purpose to destroy the wicked world by water. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, Ps 25:14. It is with all believers, enabling them to understand and apply the declarations and warnings of the written word. God chose to do it by a flood of waters, which should drown the world. As he chooses the rod with which he corrects his children, so he chooses the sword with which he cuts off his enemies. God established his covenant with Noah. This is the first place in the Bible where the word 'covenant' is found; it seems to mean, 1. The covenant of providence; that the course of nature shall be continued to the end of time. 2. The covenant of grace; that God would be a God to Noah, and that out of his seed God would take to himself a people. God directed Noah to make an ark. This ark was like the hulk of a ship, fitted to float upon the waters. It was very large, half the size of St. Paul's cathedral, and would hold more than eighteen of the largest ships now used. God could have secured Noah without putting him to any care, or pains, or trouble; but employed him in making that which was to be the means to preserve him, for the trial of his faith and obedience. Both the providence of God, and the grace of God, own and crown the obedient and diligent. God gave Noah particular orders how to make the ark, which could not therefore but be well fitted for the purpose. God promised Noah that he and his family should be kept alive in the ark. What we do in obedience to God, we and our families are likely to have the benefit of. The piety of parents gets their children good in this life, and furthers them in the way to eternal life, if they improve it.</body></html>
