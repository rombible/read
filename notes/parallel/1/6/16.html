If this <span class= "ital">zohar </span>was an open space one cubit in height, running all round the ark, and formed by not boarding over the upright beams, it would have given a sufficient supply of air, and being protected by the overhanging eaves of the roof--for the ark had no deck--would not have admitted any serious amount. of rain. So in the <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis </span>the ark has no deck, but a roof (p. 281).<p><span class= "bld">Above.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">upward. </span>The word is one of those reduplicated forms by means of which the Hebrew language expresses so much within a little compass. Consisting of only six letters, it is nevertheless a compound of five particles, and signifies <span class= "ital">from to upward .� </span>that is, thou shalt finish it (the ark, as is shown by the gender) from beneath, working upwards till the last cubit, which is not to be finished, but left open for ventilation and light.<p><span class= "bld">The door,</span> on which also much stress is laid in the Chaldean account as being essential for the protection of the inmates (p. 281), was to be at the side, and probably extended throughout the three storeys, two-thirds of which, however, might be closed as soon as the lower storeys had received their freightage of provisions. Besides this door, there must also have been apertures to admit of cleaning the cells in which the animals were confined and removing their litter, but of such lower arrangements no mention is made.<p>It is not necessary to suppose that Noah and his three sons built this vast vessel with their own hands. He was probably a powerful chieftain, and many of the Sethites may have given him aid. Implements of iron had been invented by the Cainites, and on the intermarriage of the two lines would be brought into general use. It is difficult, however, to understand now four men could feed, clean, and give water to a very large collection of animals for so many months. Without scrupulous attention to such matters, a murrain would have broken out, and as only two of many species were taken into the ark, the loss of any one of these animals would have been equivalent to the destruction of the race. The narrative, however, implies that the health of man and beast throughout the twelve months was perfect; and probably the number of the animals received into the ark was less than is commonly supposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A window</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine, hence light (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, double light, or light of midday - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-16.htm">Genesis 43:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>). Not the window which Noah afterwards opened to let out the dove, which is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6</a>), but obviously a lighting apparatus, which may have been a series of windows (Gesenius), scarcely one (Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>; Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">fenestram</span>; Kimchi, Luther, Calvin); or an opening running along the top of the sides of the ark, occupied by some translucent substance, and sheltered by the eaves of the roof (Knobel); or, what appears more probable, a light opening in the upper deck, stretching along the entire length, and continued down through the different stories (Baumgarten, Lange); or, if the roof sloped, as is most likely, an aperture along the ridge, which would admit the clear light of heaven (<span class="accented">tsohar</span>), and serve as a meridional line enabling Noah and the inmates of the ark to ascertain the hour of noon (Taylor Lewis). Keil and Murphy think we can form no proper conception of the light arrangement of the ark. The conjecture of Schultens, which is followed by Dathius, Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others, that the <span class="accented">tsohar</span> meant the covering (<span class="accented">tectum, dorsum</span>), "quo sane hoc aedificium carere non potuit, propter pluviam tot diernm continuam," is obviously incorrect - <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit</span> - to a cubit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all but a cubit (T. Lewis); into a cubit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the extent of a cubit (Ainsworth); by the cubit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by a just measure (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou finish it</span> - not the window (Gesenins, Ewald, Tueh), the feminine suffix agreeing with <span class="accented">tebah</span>, which is feminine, and not with <span class="accented">tsohar</span>, which is masculine; but the ark - <span class="cmt_word">above</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">from above to above</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the above interpretations of the preposition, either the roof, after the construction of the windows, should be regularly finished "by the just measure" (Kalisch); or the roof should be arched but a cubit, that it might be almost flat (Ainsworth); or from the eaves up toward the ridge it should be completed, leaving a cubit open or unfinished (T. Lewis). <span class="cmt_word">And the door of the ark</span> - the opening which should admit its inmates - <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories</span>. The word stories is not in the original, but some such word must be supplied. Lunge thinks that each fiat or story had an entrance or door in the side. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-21 God told Noah his purpose to destroy the wicked world by water. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, Ps 25:14. It is with all believers, enabling them to understand and apply the declarations and warnings of the written word. God chose to do it by a flood of waters, which should drown the world. As he chooses the rod with which he corrects his children, so he chooses the sword with which he cuts off his enemies. God established his covenant with Noah. This is the first place in the Bible where the word 'covenant' is found; it seems to mean, 1. The covenant of providence; that the course of nature shall be continued to the end of time. 2. The covenant of grace; that God would be a God to Noah, and that out of his seed God would take to himself a people. God directed Noah to make an ark. This ark was like the hulk of a ship, fitted to float upon the waters. It was very large, half the size of St. Paul's cathedral, and would hold more than eighteen of the largest ships now used. God could have secured Noah without putting him to any care, or pains, or trouble; but employed him in making that which was to be the means to preserve him, for the trial of his faith and obedience. Both the providence of God, and the grace of God, own and crown the obedient and diligent. God gave Noah particular orders how to make the ark, which could not therefore but be well fitted for the purpose. God promised Noah that he and his family should be kept alive in the ark. What we do in obedience to God, we and our families are likely to have the benefit of. The piety of parents gets their children good in this life, and furthers them in the way to eternal life, if they improve it.</body></html>
