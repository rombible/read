Whether, then, God's spirit be the animating breath spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-22.htm" title="All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.">Genesis 7:22</a>, whereby human life is sustained, or the spiritual part of man, his conscience and moral sense--God's best gift to him--in opposition to his flesh, the struggle henceforward is not to be indefinitely prolonged. In the first case, the struggle spoken of is that between the elements of life and death in the body; in the second, it refers to the moral probation to which man is subject. The versions generally take the former meaning, and translate "shall not dwell," or "abide "; but there is much in favour of the rendering "shall strive," though the verb more exactly means <span class= "ital">to rule, preside over, sit as judge. </span>Literally, then, it signifies that the Divine gift of life shall not rule in man "for ever;" that is, for a period so protracted as was antediluvian life. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise.">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">With man.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">with the adam: </span>spoken with especial reference to the Sethites.<p><span class= "bld">For that he also is flesh.</span>--So all the versions; but many commentators, to avoid an Aramaism which does not occur again till the later Psalms, translate, "in their erring he is (= they are) flesh." But no reason for shortening human life can be found in this commonplace assertion; and if Abraham brought these records with him from Ur, we have an explanation of the acknowledged fact that Aramaisms do occur in the earlier portions of the Bible. Man, then, is "also" flesh, that is, his body is of the same nature as those of the animals, and in spite of his noble gifts and precedence, he must submit to a life of the same moderate duration as that allotted them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> - Jehovah; not because due to the Jehovist (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso), but because the sin above specified was a direct violation of the footing of grace on which the Sethites stood - <span class="cmt_word">said</span>, - to himself, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> purposed, - <span class="cmt_word">My spirit</span> - neither "ira, seu rigida Dei justitia" (Venema), nor "the Divine spirit of life bestowed upon man, the principle of physical and ethical, natural and spiritual life" (Keil); but the Holy Ghost, the Ruach Elohim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> - <span class="cmt_word">shall not always strive</span>. <span class="accented">London</span>: <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Shall not dwell (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">non permanebit</span>; Syriac, Onkelos). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Shall not be humbled, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by dwelling in men (Gesenius, Tuch). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> More probably, shall not rule (De Wette, Delitzsch, Kalisch, Furst), or shall not judge (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), as the consequence of ruling (Symmachus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil), or shall not contend in judgment (<span class="accented">arguere, reprehendere</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> strive with a man by moral force (Calvin, Michaelis, Dathe, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Bush). <span class="cmt_word">With man, for that he also</span> <span class="accented">- beshaggam</span>.

Tuch, Colenso, and others, supposing this to have been said by God in Noah's 500th year, find a respite only of 100 years, instead of 120; but the historian does not assert that it was then God either formed or announced this determination. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 The most remarkable thing concerning the old world, is the destroying of it by the deluge, or flood. We are told of the abounding iniquity of that wicked world: God's just wrath, and his holy resolution to punish it. In all ages there has been a peculiar curse of God upon marriages between professors of true religion and its avowed enemies. The evil example of the ungodly party corrupts or greatly hurts the other. Family religion is put an end to, and the children are trained up according to the worldly maxims of that parent who is without the fear of God. If we profess to be the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, we must not marry without his consent. He will never give his blessing, if we prefer beauty, wit, wealth, or worldly honours, to faith and holiness. The Spirit of God strove with men, by sending Enoch, Noah, and perhaps others, to preach to them; by waiting to be gracious, notwithstanding their rebellions; and by exciting alarm and convictions in their consciences. But the Lord declared that his Spirit should not thus strive with men always; he would leave them to be hardened in sin, and ripened for destruction. This he determined on, because man was flesh: not only frail and feeble, but carnal and depraved; having misused the noble powers of his soul to gratify his corrupt inclinations. God sees all the wickedness that is among the children of men; it cannot be hid from him now; and if it be not repented of, it shall be made known by him shortly. The wickedness of a people is great indeed, when noted sinners are men renowned among them. Very much sin was committed in all places, by all sorts of people. Any one might see that the wickedness of man was great: but God saw that every imagination, or purpose, of the thoughts of man's heart, was only evil continually. This was the bitter root, the corrupt spring. The heart was deceitful and desperately wicked; the principles were corrupt; the habits and dispositions evil. Their designs and devices were wicked. They did evil deliberately, contriving how to do mischief. There was no good among them. God saw man's wickedness as one injured and wronged by it. He saw it as a tender father sees the folly and stubbornness of a rebellious and disobedient child, which grieves him, and makes him wish he had been childless. The words here used are remarkable; they are used after the manner of men, and do not mean that God can change, or be unhappy. Does God thus hate our sin? And shall not we be grieved to the heart for it? Oh that we may look on Him whom we have grieved, and mourn! God repented that he had made man; but we never find him repent that he redeemed man. God resolves to destroy man: the original word is very striking, 'I will wipe off man from the earth,' as dirt or filth is wiped off from a place which should be clean, and is thrown to the dunghill, the proper place for it. God speaks of man as his own creature, when he resolves upon his punishment. Those forfeit their lives who do not answer the end of their living. God speaks of resolution concerning men, after his Spirit had been long striving with them in vain. None are punished by the justice of God, but those who hate to be reformed by the grace of God.</body></html>
