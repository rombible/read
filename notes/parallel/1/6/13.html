The rendering which regards <span class="accented">ketz</span> as, like <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - the completion, consummation, fullness of a thing (here of human fleshliness or wickedness), and the following clause as epexegetic of the present (Bush), though admissible in respect of Scriptural usage (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>) and contextual harmony, is scarcely so obvious; while a third, that the end spoken of is the issue to which the moral corruption of the world was inevitably tending (Keil, Lange), does not materially differ from the first. <span class="cmt_word">Of all flesh</span>, <span class="accented">I.e.</span> of the human race, of course with the exception of Noah and his family, which "teaches us to beware of applying an inflexible literality to such terms as <span class="accented">all</span>, when used in the sense of ordinary conversation" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">Is come before me.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">before my face</span>. Not "a me constitutus est" (Gesenius), "is decreed before my throne" (Kalisch); but, "is in the contemplation of my mind as an event soon to be realized" (Murphy), with perhaps a glance at the circumstance that man s ruin had not been sought by God, but, as it were, had thrust itself upon his notice as a thing that could no longer be delayed. If <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> = the similar expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, which, when applied to rumors, signifies to reach the ear (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-9.htm">Exodus 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-11.htm">Esther 9:11</a>), it may likewise indicate the closeness or near approach of the impending calamity. <span class="cmt_word">For the earth is filled with violence through them.</span> More correctly, "<span class="accented">from their faces</span>; a facie eorum" (Vulgate). That is, "the flood of wickedness which comes up before God's face goes out from their face" in the sense of being perpetrated openly (Lange), <span class="accented">and</span> "by their conscious agency" (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, I will destroy them</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">and behold me destroying them</span>. The verb is the same as is translated "corrupt' in ver. 12, q.v., as if to convey the idea of fitting retribution (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>). Whether this destruction which was threatened against the antediluvian sinners ex tended to the loss of their souls throughout eternity may be reasoned (<span class="accented">pro</span> and con) from other Scriptures, but cannot be determined from this place, which refers solely to the-extinction of their bodily lives. <span class="cmt_word">With the earth</span>. Not <span class="accented">from</span> the earth (Samaritan), or on the earth (Syriac, Rosenm&uuml;ller), or even the earth, "thus identifying the earth with its inhabitants" (Bush), but, together with the earth (Kalisch, Keil, Alford; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-11.htm">Genesis 9:11</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). The universality of representation which characterizes this section (vers. 9-13) is regarded by Davidson, Colenso, and others as contradictory of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, which depicts the corruption as <span class="accented">only human</span>, and limits the destruction to the race of man. But as the two accounts belong to different subdivisions of the book, they cannot properly be viewed as contradictory (cf. 'Quarry on Genesis,' pp. 370, 371). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-21 God told Noah his purpose to destroy the wicked world by water. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, Ps 25:14. It is with all believers, enabling them to understand and apply the declarations and warnings of the written word. God chose to do it by a flood of waters, which should drown the world. As he chooses the rod with which he corrects his children, so he chooses the sword with which he cuts off his enemies. God established his covenant with Noah. This is the first place in the Bible where the word 'covenant' is found; it seems to mean, 1. The covenant of providence; that the course of nature shall be continued to the end of time. 2. The covenant of grace; that God would be a God to Noah, and that out of his seed God would take to himself a people. God directed Noah to make an ark. This ark was like the hulk of a ship, fitted to float upon the waters. It was very large, half the size of St. Paul's cathedral, and would hold more than eighteen of the largest ships now used. God could have secured Noah without putting him to any care, or pains, or trouble; but employed him in making that which was to be the means to preserve him, for the trial of his faith and obedience. Both the providence of God, and the grace of God, own and crown the obedient and diligent. God gave Noah particular orders how to make the ark, which could not therefore but be well fitted for the purpose. God promised Noah that he and his family should be kept alive in the ark. What we do in obedience to God, we and our families are likely to have the benefit of. The piety of parents gets their children good in this life, and furthers them in the way to eternal life, if they improve it.</body></html>
