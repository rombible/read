It describes "completeness of parts rather than of degrees in the renewed character" (Bush). "The just is the right in law, the perfect is the tested in holiness" (Murphy). If, however, the term is equivalent to the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Christian system (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11</a>), it denotes that complete readjustment of the being of a sinful man to the law of God, both legally and morally, which is effected by the whole work of Christ for man and in man; it is "the establishment of complete, unclouded, and enduring communion with God, and the full realization of a state of peace with him which, founded on a true and ever valid remission of sins, has for its consummation eternal glory" (Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In his generations.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to go in a circle; hence a circuit of years; an age or generation (<span class="accented">generatio, seeulum</span>) of men. The clause marks not simply the sphere of Noah's virtue, among his contemporaries, or only the duration of his piety, throughout his lifetime, but likewise the constancy of his religion, which, when surrounded by the filth of iniquity on every side, contracted no contagion (Calvin). "It is probable, moreover, that he was of pure descent, and in that respect also distinguished from his contemporaries, who were the offspring of promiscuous marriages between the godly and the ungodly" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And Noah walked with God</span>. The special form in which his just and perfect character revealed itself amongst his sinful contemporaries. For the import of the phrase see on Genesis 5:22. Noah was also a preacher of righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>), and probably announced to the wicked age in which -he lived the coming of the Flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-11 Noah did not find favour in the eyes of men; they hated and persecuted him, because both by his life and preaching he condemned the world: but he found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and this made him more truly honourable than the men of renown. Let this be our chief desire, let us labour that we may be accepted of him. When the rest of the world was wicked, Noah kept his integrity. God's good-will towards Noah produced this good work in him. He was a just man, that is, justified before God, by faith in the promised Seed. As such he was made holy, and had right principles; and was righteous in his conversation. He was not only honest, but devout; it was his constant care to do the will of God. God looks down upon those with an eye of favour, who sincerely look up to him with an eye of faith. It is easy to be religious when religion is in fashion; but it shows strong faith and resolution, to swim against the stream, and to appear for God when no one else appears for him; Noah did so. All kinds of sin were found among men. They corrupted God's worship. Sin fills the earth with violence, and this fully justified God's resolution to destroy the world. The contagion spread. When wickedness is become general, ruin is not far off; while there is a remnant of praying people in a nation, to empty the measure as it fills, judgments may be long kept off; but when all hands are at work to pull down the fences, by sin, and none stand in the gap to make up the breach, what can be expected but a flood of wrath?</body></html>
