Whithersoever man's violence had spread, there his home and all his works, his builded cities, his tilled land, his cattle and stores, must be entirely swept away. An absolutely new beginning was to be made by Noah, such as Adam had to undertake when he was expelled from Paradise. The reason of this necessity is next given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> its inhabitants, as in ver. 11 (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1</a>) - mankind being denominated earth because wholly earthly (Chrysostom); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the land, which had become defiled through their wickedness (vers. 12, 13; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">also</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and the earth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was corrupt</span> - in a moral sense, the causes and forms of which corruption have already been detailed in the preceding paragraph. The term is elsewhere applied to idolatry, or the sin of perverting and depraving the worship of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-7.htm">Exodus 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>); but the special sins of the antediluvians were rather licentiousness and lawlessness - <span class="cmt_word">before God</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> openly, publicly, flagrantly, and presumptuously (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>); noting the intensity of their wickedness, or intimating the fact that God had <span class="accented">seen</span> their corruption, and so commending the Divine long-suffering (Calvin), - <span class="cmt_word">and the earth was filled with violence</span>. "The outward exhibition of inward carnality" (Murphy); "injurious and cruel dealing, the violating of duties towards men, 'rapines or robberies (Chaldee)'" (Ainsworth). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-11 Noah did not find favour in the eyes of men; they hated and persecuted him, because both by his life and preaching he condemned the world: but he found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and this made him more truly honourable than the men of renown. Let this be our chief desire, let us labour that we may be accepted of him. When the rest of the world was wicked, Noah kept his integrity. God's good-will towards Noah produced this good work in him. He was a just man, that is, justified before God, by faith in the promised Seed. As such he was made holy, and had right principles; and was righteous in his conversation. He was not only honest, but devout; it was his constant care to do the will of God. God looks down upon those with an eye of favour, who sincerely look up to him with an eye of faith. It is easy to be religious when religion is in fashion; but it shows strong faith and resolution, to swim against the stream, and to appear for God when no one else appears for him; Noah did so. All kinds of sin were found among men. They corrupted God's worship. Sin fills the earth with violence, and this fully justified God's resolution to destroy the world. The contagion spread. When wickedness is become general, ruin is not far off; while there is a remnant of praying people in a nation, to empty the measure as it fills, judgments may be long kept off; but when all hands are at work to pull down the fences, by sin, and none stand in the gap to make up the breach, what can be expected but a flood of wrath?</body></html>
