The interpolation at this point of the words, "Why did you steal my silver goblet?" (LXX., Vulgate, Syriac) is superfluous. <span class="cmt_word">Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth?</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and divining he divineth</span>, or maketh trial, <span class="accented">in it</span>, the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (from which is derived <span class="accented">nachash</span>, a serpent: <span class="accented">vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>) originally signifying to hiss or whisper, and hence to mutter incantations, to practice ophiomancy, and generally to divine. The special form of divination here referred to (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or divining out of cups) was practiced by the ancient Egyptians (Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 39). "Small pieces of gold or silver, together with precious stones, marked with strange figures and signs, were thrown into the vessel; after which certain incantations were pronounced, and the evil demon was invoked; the latter was then supposed to give the answer either by intelligible words, or by pointing to some of the characters on the precious stones, or in some other more mysterious manner. Sometimes the goblet was filled with pure water, upon which the sun was allowed to play; and the figures which were thus formed, or which a lively imagination fancied it saw, were interpreted as the desired omen" (Kalisch). Traces of this ancient practice of soothsaying have been detected by some writers in the magnificent vase of turquoise belonging to Jam-shoed, the Solomon of Persia. Like Merlin's cup, described by Spenser ('Faery Queens,' 3:2, 19) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"It vertue had to show in perfect sight<br />Whatever thing was in the world contained<br />Betwixt the lowest earth and heven's hight,<br />So that it to the looker appertaynd."</span> A similar account is given by Homer of the cup of Nestor; and Alexander the Great is reported to have possessed a mystic goblet of a like kind. It is said that in the storming of Seringapatam the unfortunate Tippeo Saib retired to gaze on his divining cup, and that after standing awhile absorbed in it he returned to the fight and fell (vide Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' art. Divination). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have done evil in so doing.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-17 Joseph tried how his brethren felt towards Benjamin. Had they envied and hated the other son of Rachel as they had hated him, and if they had the same want of feeling towards their father Jacob as heretofore, they would now have shown it. When the cup was found upon Benjamin, they would have a pretext for leaving him to be a slave. But we cannot judge what men are now, by what they have been formerly; nor what they will do, by what they have done. The steward charged them with being ungrateful, rewarding evil for good; with folly, in taking away the cup of daily use, which would soon be missed, and diligent search made for it; for so it may be read, Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, as having a particular fondness for it, and for which he would search thoroughly? Or, By which, leaving it carelessly at your table, he would make trial whether you were honest men or not? They throw themselves upon Joseph's mercy, and acknowledge the righteousness of God, perhaps thinking of the injury they had formerly done to Joseph, for which they thought God was now reckoning with them. Even in afflictions wherein we believe ourselves wronged by men, we must own that God is righteous, and finds out our sin.</body></html>
