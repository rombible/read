Without being distinguished by either brilliant imagination or highly poetic diction, "its inimitable charm and excellence consist in the power of psychological truth, easy simplicity, and affecting pathos" (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">Oh my lord</span> (the interjection <span class="accented">Oh is</span> the same as that used by Judah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-20.htm">Genesis 43:20</a>; q.v.), <span class="cmt_word">let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears</span> (probably pressing towards him in his eagerness), <span class="cmt_word">and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> one invested with the authority of Pharaoh, and therefore able, like Pharaoh, either to pardon or condemn). <span class="cmt_word">My lord asked his servants, saying, Have yea father, or a brother! And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age</span> (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 37:3), <span class="cmt_word">a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him</span>. Substantially this is the account which the brethren gave of themselves from the first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-13.htm">Genesis 42:13</a>); only Judah now with exquisite tact as well as resistless pathos dwells on the threefold circumstance that the little one whose life was at stake was inexpressibly dear to his father for his dead brother's sake as well as for his departed mother's and his own. <span class="cmt_word">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him</span>. This last clause is also a rhetorical enlargement of Joseph's words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (LXX.); the phrase, to set one's eyes on any one, being commonly used in a good sense, signifying to regard any one with kindness, to look to his good (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-23.htm">Job 24:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span> Judah in this no doubt correctly reports the original conversation, although the remark is not recorded in the first account. <span class="cmt_word">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-3.htm">Genesis 43:3-5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> (literally, it was) <span class="cmt_word">when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> The effect upon Jacob of their sad communication Judah does not recite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-36.htm">Genesis 42:36</a>), but passes on to the period of the commencement of the second journey. And our father laid (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the consumption of the corn supply), Go again, and buy us a little food (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-2.htm">Genesis 43:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And we laid, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. And thy servant my father said unto us</span> (at this point Judah with increased tenderness alludes to the touching lamentation of the stricken patriarch as he first listens to the unwelcome proposition to take Benjamin from his side), <span class="cmt_word">Ye know that my wife</span> - Rachel was all through her life the wife of his affections (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-19.htm">Genesis 46:19</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">bare me two sons:</span> - Joseph and Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and the one</span> (Joseph) <span class="cmt_word">went out from me</span> (and returned not, thus indirectly alluding to his death), <span class="cmt_word">and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since.</span> Jacob means that had Joseph been alive, he would certainly have returned; but that as since that fatal day of his departure from Hebron he had never beheld him, he could only conclude that his inference was correct, and that Joseph was devoured by some beast of prey. <span class="cmt_word">And if ye take this also from me</span> (in the sense which the next clause explains), <span class="cmt_word">and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave</span> <span class="accented">- Sheol</span> (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and now</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>when I come</span> (or go) <span class="cmt_word">to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life</span> (or soul) <span class="cmt_word">is bound up in the lad's life</span> (or soul); <span class="cmt_word">it shall come to pass, when he sooth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever</span> (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> (literally, and now), <span class="cmt_word">I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman</span> (or servant) <span class="cmt_word">to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span> "There was no duty that imperiously prohibited Judah from taking the place of his unfortunate brother. His children, and even his wife, if he had been in the married state, might have been sent to Egypt. He was so far master of his own liberty that he could warrantably put himself in Benjamin's room, if the governor gave his consent" (Lawson). <span class="cmt_word">For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shall find</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my father</span>. The sublime heroism of this noble act of self-sacrifice on the part of Judah it is impossible to over-estimate. In behalf of one whom he knew was preferred to a higher place in his father's affection than himself, he was willing to renounce his liberty rather than see his aged parent die of a broken heart. The self-forgetful magnanimity of such an action has never been eclipsed, and seldom rivaled. After words so exquisitely beautiful and profoundly pathetic it was impossible for Joseph to doubt that a complete change had passed upon his brethren, and in particular upon Judah, since the day when he had eloquently urged, and they had wickedly consented, to sell their brother Joseph into Egypt. Everything was now ready for the denouement in this domestic drama. The story of Joseph's discovery of himself to his astonished brethren is related in the ensuing chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:18-34 Had Joseph been, as Judah supposed him, an utter stranger to the family, he could not but be wrought upon by his powerful reasonings. But neither Jacob nor Benjamin need an intercessor with Joseph; for he himself loved them. Judah's faithful cleaving to Benjamin, now, in his distress, was recompensed long afterwards by the tribe of Benjamin keeping with the tribe of Judah, when the other tribes deserted it. The apostle, when discoursing of the mediation of Christ, observes, that our Lord sprang out of Judah, Heb 7:14; and he not only made intercession for the transgressors, but he became a Surety for them, testifying therein tender concern, both for his Father and for his brethren. Jesus, the great antitype of Joseph, humbles and proves his people, even after they have had some tastes of his loving-kindness. He brings their sins to their remembrance, that they may exercise and show repentance, and feel how much they owe to his mercy.</body></html>
