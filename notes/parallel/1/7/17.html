First, the "waters increased," and raised up the ark till it floated. Next, "they became strong and increased exceedingly"--the word rendered "prevailed" really signifying the setting in of mighty currents (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-1.htm" title="And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;">Genesis 8:1</a>), as the waters sought the lower ground--and at this stage the ark began to move. Finally, they "became strong exceedingly, exceedingly," rushing along with ever-increasing force, and carrying the ark high above every hill in its course. Of these it is said--<p><span class= "bld">All the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.</span>--Interpreting this by the English Version, many regard it as a proof of the deluge having been universal. But omitting the well-known fact that in the Bible the word "all" means much less than with us, we must also remember that the Hebrew language has a very small vocabulary, and "the whole heaven" means simply <span class= "ital">the whole shy. </span>We with our composite language borrow a word for it from the Greek, and say "the whole horizon," that is, the whole heaven, bounded by the line of the spectators vision. So then here. Far and wide, in every direction, to the utmost reach of the beholder's gaze, no mountain was in sight. All was a surging waste of flood. But there is no idea here of the mountains of Auvergne, with the ashes of old-world volcanoes still reposing upon their craters, extinct from a time probably long anterior to the creation even of man. The mountains were those of the Noachian world, as limited as the Roman world of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>, or even more so.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the flood was forty days upon the earth</span>.

Literally, <span class="accented">and the waters became strong, exceedingly</span>. The <span class="accented">third degree</span> of increase, marked by the <span class="accented">submergence</span> of the mountains. <span class="cmt_word">And all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.</span> A clear assertion of the universality of the Flood (Keil, Kalisch, Alford, Bush, Wordsworth); but the language does not necessarily imply more than that all the high hills beneath the spectator s heaven were submerged (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25</a>, for instances in which the universal terms all and every must be taken with a limited signification); while it is almost certain that, had the narrator even designed to record only the fact that all the heights within the visible horizon had disappeared beneath the rising waters, he would have done so by saying that "all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered." While, then, it is admitted that the words may depict a complete submergence of the globe, it is maintained by many competent scholars that the necessities of exegesis only demand a partial inundation (Peele, Murphy, Taylor Lewis, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-20 The flood was increasing forty days. The waters rose so high, that the tops of the highest mountains were overflowed more than twenty feet. There is no place on earth so high as to set men out of the reach of God's judgments. God's hand will find out all his enemies, Ps 21:8. When the flood thus increased, Noah's ark was lifted up, and the waters which broke down every thing else, bore up the ark. That which to unbelievers betokens death unto death, to the faithful betokens life unto life.</body></html>
