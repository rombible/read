A general expression for the animal creation, of which the particulars are then specified. <span class="cmt_word">Both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in</span> fowl, and in cattle, etc. (cf. ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">And every man</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the human race (with the exception of the inmates of the ark), which is further characterized as <span class="cmt_word">all in whose nostrils was the breath of life</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">the breath of the spirit of lives, i.e.</span> all mankind. A clear pointing backwards to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, which leads Davidson to ascribe vers. 22, 23 to the Jehovist, although Eichhorn, Tuch, Bleek, Vaihinger, and others leave them in the fundamental document, but which is rather to be regarded as a proof of the internal unity of the book. <span class="cmt_word">Of all that was in the dry land</span>, - a further specification of the creatures that perished in the Flood, - <span class="cmt_word">died</span>. It is obvious the construction of vers. 21, 22 may be differently understood. Each verse may be taken as a separate sentence, as in the A.V., or the second sentence may commence with the words, "And every man," as in the present exposition. Thus far the calamity is simply viewed in its objective result, In the words which follow, which wear the aspect of an unnecessary repetition, it is regarded in its relation to the Divine threatening. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:21-24 All the men, women, and children, that were in the world, excepting those in the ark, died. We may easily imagine what terror seized them. Our Saviour tells us, that till the very day that the flood came, they were eating and drinking, Lu 17:26,27; they were deaf and blind to all Divine warnings. In this posture death surprised them. They were convinced of their folly when it was too late. We may suppose they tried all ways and means possible to save themselves, but all in vain. And those that are not found in Christ, the Ark, are certainly undone, undone for ever. Let us pause, and consider this tremendous judgment! Who can stand before the Lord when he is angry? The sin of sinners will be their ruin, first or last, if not repented of. The righteous God knows how to bring ruin upon the world of the ungodly, 2Pe 2:5. How tremendous will be the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men! Happy they who are part of Christ's family, and safe with him as such; they may look forward without dismay, and rejoice that they shall triumph, when fire shall burn up the earth, and all that therein is. We are apt to suppose some favourable distinctions in our own case or character; but if we neglect, refuse, or abuse the salvation of Christ, we shall, notwithstanding such fancied advantages, be destroyed in the common ruin of an unbelieving world.</body></html>
