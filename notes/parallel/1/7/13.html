Not inconsistent with vers. 4, 5, which do not necessarily imply that the actual entry was made seven days before the Flood; but merely that Noah then began to carry out the Divine instructions. The threefold recital of the entry - first in connection with the invitation or command (ver. 5), and again in the actual process during the seven days (ver. 7), and finally on the day when the Flood began (ver. 15), - besides lending emphasis to the narrative, heightens its dramatic effect. <span class="cmt_word">They, and every beast after his Mad, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort</span> (literally, <span class="accented">wing</span>). The creatures here specified correspond with the enumeration - viz., chay-yah, behemah, remes - in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a>, q.v. The last clause, <span class="accented">kol-canaph</span>, Kalisch, following Clericus, translates, though, according to Rosenm&uuml;ller, without satisfactory reasons, "every winged creature," and so makes "three classes of winged beings - the eatable species (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>), the birds which people the air and enliven it by the sounds of their melodies (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>), and the endless swarms of insects (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span>), the greatest part of which possess neither the utility of the former nor the beauty of the latter. Gesenius, however, translates <span class="accented">it</span> "birds of all kinds," and Knobel regards it as synonymous with "<span class="accented">every</span> bird." The LXX. give the sense of the two clauses: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-16 The ravenous creatures were made mild and manageable; yet, when this occasion was over, they were of the same kind as before; for the ark did not alter their natures. Hypocrites in the church, who outwardly conform to the laws of that ark, are yet unchanged; and it will appear, one time or other, what kind they are after. God continued his care of Noah. God shut the door, to secure him and keep him safe in the ark; also to keep all others for ever out. In what manner this was done, God has not been pleased to make known. There is much of our gospel duty and privilege to be seen in Noah's safety in the ark. The apostle makes it a type of christian baptism, 1Pe 3:20,21. Observe then, it is our great duty, in obedience to the gospel call, by a lively faith in Christ, to come into that way of salvation which God has provided for poor sinners. Those that come into the ark, should bring as many as they can with them, by good instructions, by persuasions, and by good examples. There is room enough in Christ for all comers. God put Adam into paradise, but did not shut him in, so he threw himself out; but when God put Noah into the ark, and so when he brings a soul to Christ, the salvation is sure: it is not in our own keeping, but in the Mediator's hand. But the door of mercy will shortly be shut against those that now make light of it. Knock now, and it shall be opened, Lu 13:25.</body></html>
