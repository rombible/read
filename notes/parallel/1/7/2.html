If, however, <span class= "ital">seven pairs </span>be the right interpretation, but few species could have been included, as to attend properly to so large a number of animals would have been beyond the power of Noah and his sons. But which were the clean beasts? There can be no reference here to the Levitical law, which had respect to human food; nor to animals tamed and untamed, as all alike are called cattle; but probably the clean cattle were such as from the days of Adam 'and Abel had been offered in sacrifice. Thus provision was made for Noah's sacrifice on his egress from the ark, and also for his possession of a small herd of such animals as would be most useful to him amid the desolation which must have existed for a long time after the flood. The clean beasts would therefore be oxen, sheep, goats; the unclean, camels, horses, asses, and such other animals as stood in some relation to man. Of birds, the dove would especially be clean.<p>It has been pointed out that these more full and specific orders are given in the name of Jehovah, whereas most of the narrative of the flood is Elohistic, and hence it has been assumed that some Jehovist narrator added to and completed the earlier narrative. These additions would be <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1-6</a>. the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-16.htm" title="And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.">Genesis 7:16</a>, Noah's sacrifice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/8-20.htm" title="And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.">Genesis 8:20-22</a>, and the cursing of Canaan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/9-18.htm" title="And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.">Genesis 9:18-27</a>. Now, it is remarkable that the sacrifice is as integral a portion of the <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis </span>as the sending forth of the birds (<span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis, </span>p. 286), and is thus indubitably older than the time of Moses. Still, there is nothing improbable in Moses having two records of the flood before him, and while the division of Genesis into Elohistic and Jehovistic portions usually breaks down, there is a <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>appearance of the combination of two narratives in the present history, or, at least, in this one section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of every clean beast</span>. That the distinction between clean and unclean animals was at this time understood is easier to believe than that the writer would perpetrate the glaring anachronism of introducing in prediluvian times what only took its rise several centuries later (Kalisch). That this distinction was founded on nature, "every tribe of mankind being able to distinguish between the sheep and the hyena, the dove and the vulture" ('Speaker's Commentary'), or "on an immediate conscious feeling of the human spirit, not yet clouded by any ungodly and unnatural culture, which leads it to see in many beasts pictures of sin and corruption" (Keil), has been supposed; but with greater probability it was of Divine institution, with reference to the necessities of sacrifice (Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>). To this was appended in the Levitical system a distinction between clean and unclean in respect of man's food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-3.htm">Leviticus 11:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou take</span> - inconsistent with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-20.htm">Genesis 6:20</a>, which says the animals were to come to Noah (Colenso); but <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>, which says that Noah was to bring them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> make them go (at least nearly equivalent to take), clearly recognizes Noah's agency (Quarry) - <span class="cmt_word">to thee by sevens.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">seven, seven</span>; either seven <span class="accented">pairs</span> (Vulgate, LXX., Aben Ezra, Clericus, Michaells, De Wette, Knobel, Kalisch, Murphy, Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary'), or seven individuals (Chrysostom, Augustine, Theodoret, Calvin, Pererius, Wiliet, Delitzsch, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Bush); both parties quoting the next clause in support of their particular interpretation. Davidson, Colenso, and Kalisch challenge both interpretations as "irreconcilable with the preceding narrative" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>); but the obvious answer is, that while in the first communication, which was given 120 years before, when minute instructions were not required, it is simply stated that the animals should be preserved by pairs; in the second, when the ark was finished and the animals were about to be collected, it is added that, in the case of the few clean beasts used for sacrifice, an exception should be made to the general rule, and not one pair, but either three pairs with one over, or seven pairs, should be preserved. <span class="cmt_word">The male and his female</span>. This seems to be most in favor of the first interpretation, that pairs, and not individuals, are meant. <span class="cmt_word">And of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.</span> <span class="accented">Ish veishto</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>, where the phrase denotes the ethical personality of human beings, to which there is here an approximation, as the preserved animals were designed to be the parents of subsequent races. The usual phrase for male and female, which is employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> (a so-called Elohistic) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-3.htm">Genesis 7:3</a> (a so-called Jehovistic section), refers to the physical distinction of sex in human beings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-12 The call to Noah is very kind, like that of a tender father to his children to come in-doors when he sees night or a storm coming. Noah did not go into the ark till God bade him, though he knew it was to be his place of refuge. It is very comfortable to see God going before us in every step we take. Noah had taken a great deal of pains to build the ark, and now he was himself kept alive in it. What we do in obedience to the command of God, and in faith, we ourselves shall certainly have the comfort of, first or last. This call to Noah reminds us of the call the gospel gives to poor sinners. Christ is an ark, in whom alone we can be safe, when death and judgment approach. The word says, Come; ministers say, Come; the Spirit says, Come, come into the Ark. Noah was accounted righteous, not for his own righteousness, but as an heir of the righteousness which is by faith, Heb 11:7. He believed the revelation of a saviour, and sought and expected salvation through Him alone. Thus was he justified by faith, and received that Spirit whose fruit is in all goodness; but if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. After the hundred and twenty years, God granted seven days' longer space for repentance. But these seven days were trifled away, like all the rest. It shall be but seven days. They had only one week more, one sabbath more to improve, and to consider the things that belonged to their peace. But it is common for those who have been careless of their souls during the years of their health, when they have looked upon death at a distance, to be as careless during the days, the few days of their sickness, when they see death approaching; their hearts being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. As Noah prepared the ark by faith in the warning given that the flood would come, so he went into it, by faith in this warning that it would come quickly. And on the day Noah was securely fixed in the ark, the fountains of the great deep were broken up. The earth had within it those waters, which, at God's command, sprang up and flooded it; and thus our bodies have in themselves those humours, which, when God pleases, become the seeds and springs of mortal diseases. The windows of heaven were opened, and the waters which were above the firmament, that is, in the air, were poured out upon the earth. The rain comes down in drops; but such rains fell then, as were never known before or since. It rained without stop or abatement, forty days and forty nights, upon the whole earth at once. As there was a peculiar exercise of the almighty power of God in causing the flood, it is vain and presumptuous to attempt explaining the method of it, by human wisdom.</body></html>
