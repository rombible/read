Mount Ararat was to the north-west of Shinar, and while so lofty a mountain could not have been the spot where the ark rested, yet neither could any portion of Armenia or of the Carduchian mountains be described as to the east of Babylonia. The Chaldean legends make the ark rest on Mount Nizir, or Elwend, on the east of Assyria; and though Ararat may possibly signify <span class= "ital">Aryaverta, </span>"Holy Land," yet the transference of the name from Elwend to Armenia is not easily explicable. Moreover, the Bible elsewhere seems to point to Armenia as the cradle of the human race. Most modern commentators, therefore, translate <span class= "ital">eastward, </span>and such certainly is the meaning of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm" title="Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.">Genesis 13:11</a>, where also the versions, excepting our own, render <span class= "ital">from the east.</span><p><span class= "bld">Land of Shinar.</span>--See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>. The whole of Chaldea is a level plain, and the soil immensely rich, as it is an alluvial deposit, which still goes on forming at the head of the Persian Gulf, at the rate of a mile in a period estimated at from seventy to thirty years (Rawlinson, <span class= "ital">Anc. Mon., </span>i. 4). A strip of land 130 miles in breadth has been added to the country, by the deposit of the earth washed down by the Tigris and Euphrates, since the time when Ur of the Chaldees was a great port.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as they journeyed</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">in their journeyings</span>. The root (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, to pull up, as, e.g., the stakes of a tent when a camp moves, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>) suggests the idea of the migration of nomadic hordes (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-9.htm">Genesis 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the east</span>. <span class="accented">Ab oriente</span> (Ancient Versions, Calvin, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), meaning either that they started from Armenia, which was in the east <span class="accented">respectu terrae Canaan</span> (Luther), or from that portion of the Assyrian empire which was east of the Tigris, and called Orientalis, as distinguished from the Occidentalis on the west (Bochart); or that they first traveled westwards, following the direction of the Euphrates in one of its upper branches (Bush); or that, having roamed to the east of Shinar, they ultimately returned <span class="accented">occidentem versus</span> (Junius). The phrase, however, is admitted to be more correctly rendered <span class="accented">ad</span> <span class="accented">orientem</span> (Drusius, Lange, Keil, Murphy), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm">Genesis 13:11</a>. Kalisch interprets generally <span class="accented">in oriente</span>, agreeing with Luther that the migrations are viewed by the writer as taking place in the east; while T. Lewis prefers to read from one front part (the original meaning of <span class="accented">kedem</span>) to another - onwards. <span class="cmt_word">That they found a plain</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; not a valley between mountain ranges, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a>, but a widely-extended plain (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.), like that in which Babylon was situated (Herod., lib. 1:178, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>; cf.

The derivation of the term is unknown (Gesenius), though it probably meant the land of the two rivers (Alford). Its absence from ancient monuments (Rawlinson) suggests that it was the Jewish name for Chaldaea. <span class="cmt_word">And they dwelt there</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-4 How soon men forget the most tremendous judgments, and go back to their former crimes! Though the desolations of the deluge were before their eyes, though they sprang from the stock of righteous Noah, yet even during his life-time, wickedness increases exceedingly. Nothing but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit can remove the sinful lusts of the human will, and the depravity of the human heart. God's purpose was, that mankind should form many nations, and people all lands. In contempt of the Divine will, and against the counsel of Noah, the bulk of mankind united to build a city and a tower to prevent their separating. Idolatry was begun, and Babel became one of its chief seats. They made one another more daring and resolute. Let us learn to provoke one another to love and to good works, as sinners stir up and encourage one another to wicked works.</body></html>
