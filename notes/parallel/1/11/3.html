A hortatory expletive - come on (Anglice). <span class="cmt_word">Let us make brick</span>. <span class="accented">Nilbenah lebenim</span>; literally, let us brick bricks; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); <span class="accented">laterifecimus lateres</span> (Calvin); <span class="accented">lebenah</span> (from <span class="accented">laban, to</span> be white), being so called from the white and chalky day of which bricks were made. <span class="cmt_word">And burn them thoroughly</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">burn them to a burning</span>; <span class="accented">venisrephah lisrephah</span>, a second alliteration, which, however, the LXX. fails to reproduce. Bricks were usually sun-dried; these, being designed to be more durable, were to be calcined through the agency of fire, a proof that the tower-builders were acquainted with the art of brick-making. <span class="cmt_word">And they had</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and there was to</span> theme - <span class="cmt_word">brick for stone</span>. Chiefly because of the necessities of the place, the alluvial plain of Babylon being void of stones and full of clay; a proof of the greatness of their crime, seeing they were induced to undertake the work <span class="accented">non facilitate operis, nec aliis commodis, quae se ad manum offerrent</span> (Calvin); scarcely because bricks would better endure fire than would stones, the second destruction of the world by fire rather than water being by this time a common expectation (Com a Lapide). Josephus, 'Ant., lib. 1. cp. 4; Herod, lib. 1. cp. 179; Justin, lib. 1. cp. 2; Ovid, ' Metam.,' 4:4; and Aristoph. in Avibus (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), all attest that the walls of Babylon were built of brick. The mention of the circumstance that brick was used instead of stone "indicates a writer belonging to a country and an age in which stone buildings were familiar, and therefore not to Babylonia" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And slime.</span> <span class="accented">Chemer, from chamar</span>, to boil up; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); the bitumen which boils up from subterranean fountains like oil or hot pitch in the vicinity of Babylon, and also near the Dead Sea (<span class="accented">lacus</span> <span class="accented">asphaltites</span>). Tacitus, ' Hist.,' 5:6; Strabo, 16. p. 743; Herod., lib. h c. 179; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' lib. 1. c. 41 Pliny, lib. 35. 100. 15; Vitruvius, lib. 8. c. 3, are unanimous in declaring that the brick walls of Babylon were cemented with bitumen. Layard testifies that so firmly have the bricks been united that it is almost impossible to detach one from the mass ('Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 499). <span class="cmt_word">Had they</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">was to them</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For mortar</span>. <span class="accented">Chomer</span>. The third instance of alliteration in the present verse; possibly designed by the writer to represent the enthusiasm of the builders. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-4 How soon men forget the most tremendous judgments, and go back to their former crimes! Though the desolations of the deluge were before their eyes, though they sprang from the stock of righteous Noah, yet even during his life-time, wickedness increases exceedingly. Nothing but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit can remove the sinful lusts of the human will, and the depravity of the human heart. God's purpose was, that mankind should form many nations, and people all lands. In contempt of the Divine will, and against the counsel of Noah, the bulk of mankind united to build a city and a tower to prevent their separating. Idolatry was begun, and Babel became one of its chief seats. They made one another more daring and resolute. Let us learn to provoke one another to love and to good works, as sinners stir up and encourage one another to wicked works.</body></html>
