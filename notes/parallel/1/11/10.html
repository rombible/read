According to the Hebrew, the total number of years from Shem to the birth of Abram was 390, according to the Samaritan, 1,040, and according to the LXX., 1,270. These larger totals are obtained by adding, as a rule, one hundred years to the age of each patriarch before the birth of his eldest son, and the LXX. also insert Cainan between Arphaxad and Salah. The virtual agreement of two authorities, coming from such different quarters as the Samaritan transcript and the LXX. version is remarkable, but scholars have long acknowledged that these genealogies were never intended for chronological purposes, and that so to employ them leads only to error.<p>Like the genealogy of Seth, in Genesis 5, the <span class= "ital">Toldoth Shem </span>also consists of ten generations, and thus forms, according to Hebrew ideas respecting the number ten, a perfect representation of the race. With the exception of Arphaxad (for whom see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22</a>), the names in this genealogy are all Hebrew words, and are full of meaning. Thus--<p><span class= "bld">Salah </span>means <span class= "ital">mission, </span>the sending out of men in colonies to occupy new lands.<p><span class= "bld">Eber </span>is the <span class= "ital">passage, </span>marking the migration of the head-quarters of the race, and the crossing of some great obstacle in its way, most probably the river Tigris. With this would begin the long struggle between the Semitic and Hamitic races in Mesopotamia.<p><span class= "bld">Peleg, </span><span class= "ital">division, </span>may be a memorial of the separation of the Joktanite Arabs from the main stem, but see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-25.htm" title="And to Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.">Genesis 10:25</a>. Through him the rights of primogeniture passed to the Hebrews.<p><span class= "bld">Reu, </span><span class= "ital">friendship, </span>seems to indicate a closer drawing together of the rest after the departure of Joktan and his clan, which probably had been preceded by dissensions.<p><span class= "bld">Serug, </span><span class= "ital">intertwining, </span>may denote that this friendship between the various races into which the family of Shem was by this time divided was cemented by intermarriage.<p><span class= "bld">Nahor, </span><span class= "ital">panting, earnest struggle, </span>indicates, most probably, the commencement of that seeking after a closer communion with God which made his descendants withdraw from contact with the rest and form a separate community, distinguished by its firm hold of the doctrine of the unity of the Godhead. From the words of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm" title="And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.">Joshua 24:2</a>) it is plain, not only that idolatry was generally practised among the descendants of Shem, but that even Nahor and Terah were not free from its influence. Yet, probably, the monotheism of Abraham was preceded by an effort to return to the purer doctrine of their ancestors in Nahor's time, and the gods which they still worshipped were the teraphim, regarded both by Laban and Rachel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm" title="And now, though you would needs be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?">Genesis 31:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-34.htm" title="Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.">Genesis 31:34</a>) as a kind of inferior household genius, which brought good luck to the family.<p><span class= "bld">Terah, </span><span class= "ital">wandering, </span>indicates the commencement of that separation from the rest caused by religious differences, which ended in the migration of Abram into Canaan.<p>In <span class= "bld">Abram, </span><span class= "ital">high-father, </span>we have a prophetic name, indicative of the high purpose for which the father of the faithful was chosen. There is a difficulty about the date of his birth. We read that "Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a> that "the days of Terah were two hundred and five years." But St. Stephen says that Terah died in Haran before Abram's migration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm" title="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.">Acts 7:4</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm" title="So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.">Genesis 12:4</a> we are told that Abram was seventy-five years of age when he departed from that country. Either, therefore, Terah was a hundred and thirty years old when Abram was born--and Abram was a younger, and not the older son--or the Samaritan text is right in making the total age of Terah a hundred and forty-five years. The latter is probably the true solution: first, because Nahor died at the age of a hundred and forty-eight, and it is not probable that Terah so long outlived him; for human life, as we have seen, was progressively shortening after the flood: and secondly, because Abram, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm" title="Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?">Genesis 17:17</a>, speaks of it as almost an impossibility for a man to have a son when he is a hundred years old. Had he been born when his father was a hundred and thirty, he could scarcely have spoken in this way.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the generations of Shem</span>.

The English term is borrowed from the LXX., the Hebrew being Arpaehshadh, a compound of which the principal part is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span>, giving rise to the Chashdim or Chaldeans; whence Professor Lewis regards it as originally the name of a people transferred to their ancestor (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Two years after the flood.</span> So that in Noah's 603rd year Shem was 100, and must accordingly have been born in Noah's 503rd year, i.e. two years after Japheth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>). The mention of the Flood indicates the point of time from which the present section is designed to be reckoned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-26 Here is a genealogy, or list of names, ending in Abram, the friend of God, and thus leading towards Christ, the promised Seed, who was the son of Abram. Nothing is left upon record but their names and ages; the Holy Ghost seeming to hasten through them to the history of Abram. How little do we know of those that are gone before us in this world, even of those that lived in the same places where we live, as we likewise know little of those who now live in distant places! We have enough to do to mind our own work. When the earth began to be peopled, men's lives began to shorten; this was the wise disposal of Providence.</body></html>
