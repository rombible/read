the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>). The object of the builders was twofold: first, they wished to have some central beacon which might guide them in their return from their wanderings; and secondly, they had a distinctly ambitious object, for by remaining as one nation they would be able to reduce to obedience all the tribes now perpetually wandering away from them, and so would "make them a name." We may, indeed, dismiss the silly stories of Josephus about their defiance of God and Nimrod's impiety, and the purpose of escaping a second deluge, for all which there is not the least vestige of authority in the sacred record; but we undoubtedly find a political purpose of preventing that dispersion of mankind which God had commanded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>), and of using the consequent aggregation of population for the attaining to empire. There was probably some one able and ambitious mind at the bottom of this purpose, and doubtless it had very many advantages: for it is what is now called centralisation, by which the individual sacrifices his rights to the nation, the provinces to the capital, and small nations are bound together in one empire, that the force of the whole body may be brought to bear more rapidly and effectually in carrying out the will of the nation or of the ruler, as the case may be. Nimrod's efforts at a later date were successful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10-12</a>); and when we remember the blood-stained course of some of his cities, we may well doubt whether, with all its present advantages, this centralisation really promotes human happiness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said</span>.

This tower is commonly identified with the temple of Belus, which Herodotus describes (1. 181) as being quadrangular (two stadia each way), and having gates of brass, with a solid tower in the middle, consisting of eight sections, each a stadium in height, placed one above another, ascended by a spiral staircase, and having in the top section a spacious temple with a golden table and a well-furnished bed. Partially destroyed by Xerxes ( <span class="date">B.C. 490</span>), it was attempted unsuccessfully to be rebuilt by Alexander the Great; but the remaining portion of the edifice was known to be in existence five centuries later, and was sufficiently imposing to be recognized as the temple of Belus (Pliny, 6:30). The site of this ancient tower is supposed by George Smith to be covered by the ruin "Babil," a square mound about 200 yards each way, in the north of the city; and that of the tower of Babel to be occupied by the ruin Birs-Nimrod (situated six miles south-west of Hillah, which is about forty miles west of Bagdad), a tower consisting of seven stages, said by inscriptions on cylinders extracted from the ruin to have been "the Temple of the Seven Planets, which had been partially built by a former king of Babylon, and, having fallen into decay, was restored and completed by Nebuchadnezzar" ('Assyrian Discoveries,' 12. p. 59; 'Chaldaean Genesis,' p. 163; cf. Layard's 'Nineveh and Babylon,' chap. 22. p. 496). It is, however, <span class="accented">prima facie</span>, unlikely that either Babil or Birs-Nimrod is the exact site of Babel. The original building was never finished, and may not have attained any great dimensions. Perhaps the most that can be said is that these existing mounds enable us to picture what sort of erection the tower of Babel was to be. <span class="cmt_word">And let us make a name</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>; neither an idol temple, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span> being = God, which it never is without the article, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> - cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a> (Jewish writers); nor a monument, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a> (Clericus); nor a metropolis, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a> (Clericus); nor a tower that might serve as a sign to guide the wandering nomads and guard them against getting lost when spread abroad with their flocks, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-13.htm">Isaiah 55:13</a> (Perizonius, Dathe, Ilgen); but a name, a reputation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-12.htm">Isaiah 63:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a> (Luther, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth, Kalisch). This was the first impelling motive to the erection of the city and tower. The offspring of ambition, it was designed to spread abroad their fame <span class="accented">usque ad ultimos terrarum fines</span> (Calvin). According to Philo, each man wrote his name upon a brick before he built it in. The second was to establish a rallying point that might serve to maintain their unity. <span class="cmt_word">Lest we be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="accented">Lest - antequam</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span>, before that, as if anticipating that the continuous increase of population would necessitate their dispersion (LXX., Vulgute), or as if determined to distinguish themselves before surrendering to the Divine command to spread themselves abroad (Luther); but the more exact rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">ne</span>, lest, introducing an apodosis expressive of something to be avoided by a preceding action (cf.

What the builders dreaded was not the recurrence of a flood (Josephus, Lyra), but the execution of the Divine purpose intimated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>, and perhaps recalled to their remembrance by Noah (Usher), or by Sham (Wordsworth), or by Eber (Candlish); and what the builders aimed at was resistance to the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the face of the whole earth.</span> Over the entire surface of the globe, and not simply over the land of Shiner (Inglis), or over the immediate region in which they dwelt (Clericus,.

Though the desolations of the deluge were before their eyes, though they sprang from the stock of righteous Noah, yet even during his life-time, wickedness increases exceedingly. Nothing but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit can remove the sinful lusts of the human will, and the depravity of the human heart. God's purpose was, that mankind should form many nations, and people all lands. In contempt of the Divine will, and against the counsel of Noah, the bulk of mankind united to build a city and a tower to prevent their separating. Idolatry was begun, and Babel became one of its chief seats. They made one another more daring and resolute. Let us learn to provoke one another to love and to good works, as sinners stir up and encourage one another to wicked works.</body></html>
