But in most ancient languages men are said to <span class= "ital">cut </span>or <span class= "ital">strike </span>a covenant, because the most solemn formula involved either the cutting of victims in two, or striking them dead, as was the Roman manner. The severing of the bodies was not, as some suppose, to represent the two parties; but, as explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/34-18.htm" title="And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof,">Jeremiah 34:18-20</a>, it set forth the penalty of perjury, and was usually accompanied by the imprecation upon the covenant-breaker of a destruction as complete as that which had befallen the slaughtered animals. There is no mention in this place of a sacrifice, although the animals are those subsequently set apart for sacrifice by the Levitical law. The heifer, she-goat, and ram at three years old would each have attained its full maturity; but there may be a further symbolic meaning in there being three animals each three years old.<p><span class= "bld">Laid each piece . . . --</span>More exactly, <span class= "ital">and laid each half over against the other. </span>The birds were not divided; but as there were two, Abram probably placed one on one side and one on the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him, Take me</span> (literally, <span class="accented">for</span> me, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for my use in sacrifice) <span class="cmt_word">an heifer of three years old</span>.

God never promises more than he is able to perform, as men often do. Abram did as God commanded him. He divided the beasts in the midst, according to the ceremony used in confirming covenants, Jer 34:18,19. Having prepared according to God's appointment, he set himself to wait for the sign God might give him. A watch must be kept upon our spiritual sacrifices. When vain thoughts, like these fowls, come down upon our sacrifices, we must drive them away, and seek to attend on God without distraction.</body></html>
