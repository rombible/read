The revelation on this occasion is made by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>), not however in a dream, but in a trance, in which the senses of Abram were closed to all earthly impressions and he became passive in the hands of the Almighty. Up to this time Abram had received only general promises of offspring, and of the land being the possession of his seed; but years were passing by, and the fulfilment of his hopes remained distant as ever. By the war with the Elamite king he had also made for himself powerful enemies; and though the immediate result was fortunate, yet many Canaanite nations may have witnessed with displeasure so remarkable an exhibition of the power and energy of an "immigrant." And thus the time had come when the patriarch needed and obtained more formal assurances, first, of the bestowal upon him of offspring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1-6</a>), and, secondly, of the future possession of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span> - the events just recorded - <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- Deb ar Jehovah</span>; the first occurrence of this remarkable phrase, afterwards so common in the Hebrew Scriptures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-16.htm">Numbers 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a><span class="accented">, et passim</span>). That this was a personal designation of the pre-incarnate Logos, if not susceptible of complete demonstration, yet receives not a little sanction from the language employed throughout this narrative (cf. Vers. 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, etc.). At least the expression denotes "the Lord manifesting himself by speech to his servant" (Murphy; <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 1:3) - <span class="cmt_word">came</span> (literally, was) <span class="cmt_word">unto Abram in a vision</span> - a night vision, but no dream (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 5). Biblically viewed, the vision, as distinguished from the ordinary dream, defines the presentation to the bodily senses or to the mental consciousness of objects usually beyond the sphere of their natural activities; hence visions might be imparted in dreams (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>), or in trances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Fear not, Abram.</span> With allusion, doubtless, to the patriarch's mental dejection, which was probably occasioned by the natural re action consequent upon his late high-pitched excitement (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>), which might lead him to anticipate either a war of revenge from the Asiatic monarchs (Jonathan), or an assault from the heathen Canaanites, already jealous of his growing power, or perhaps both. Wordsworth observes that the words here addressed to Abram are commonly employed in Scripture to introduce announcements of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a>; cf. St. John's vision, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am thy shield, and thy exceed lag great reward.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">thy reward, exceeding abundantly</span>, the hiphil inf. abs. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> being always used adverbially (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-33.htm">Nehemiah 3:33</a>), The other rendering, "thy reward m exceeding great" (LXX., Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, Ewald), fails to give prominence to the thought that the patriarch's reward was to be the all-sufficient Jehovah himself. It is not needful to suppose with Lange an actual vision of a shield and treasure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1 God assured Abram of safety and happiness; that he should for ever be safe. I am thy shield; or, I am a shield to thee, present with thee, actually caring for thee. The consideration that God himself is, and will be a shield to his people, to secure them from all evils, a shield ready to them, and a shield round about them, should silence all perplexing, tormenting fears.</body></html>
