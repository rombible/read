The body may be buried far away, but the soul joins the company of its forefathers in some separate abode, not to be absorbed, but still to enjoy a personal existence. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a>.) A similar, but more exact, distinction between the body and the spirit is drawn in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>). Not a periphrasis for going to the grave (Rosenm&uuml;ller), since Abram s ancestors were not entombed in Canaan; but a proof of the survival of departed spirits in a state of conscious existence after death (Knobel, Murphy, Wordsworth, 'Speaker s Commentary,' Inglis), to the company of which the patriarch was in due time to be gathered. The disposal of his remains is provided for in what follows. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:12-16 A deep sleep fell upon Abram; with this sleep a horror of great darkness fell upon him: a sudden change. The children of light do not always walk in the light. Several things were then foretold. 1. The suffering state of Abram's seed for a long time. They shall be strangers. The heirs of heaven are strangers on earth. They shall be servants; but Canaanites serve under a curse, the Hebrews under a blessing. They shall be suffers. Those that are blessed and beloved of God, are often sorely afflicted by wicked men. 2. The judgment of the enemies of Abram's seed. Though God may allow persecutors and oppressors to trample upon his people a great while, he will certainly reckon with them at last. 3. That great event, the deliverance of Abram's seed out of Egypt, is here foretold. 4. Their happy settlement in Canaan. They shall come hither again. The measure of sin fills gradually. Some people's measure of sin fills slowly. The knowledge of future events would seldom add to our comfort. In the most favoured families, and most happy lives, there are so many afflictions, that it is merciful in God to conceal what will befall us and ours.</body></html>
