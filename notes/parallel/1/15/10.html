The word is afterwards found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-17.htm">Song of Solomon 2:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>) them in the midst, - <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.); in equal parts (Onkelos) - <span class="cmt_word">and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</span> So afterwards in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>). Wordsworth detects in the non-dividing of the birds an emblem of "the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of peace and love; which is a Spirit of unity, and of "Christ's human spirit, which was not divisible." Kalisch, with more probability, recognizes as the reason of their not being divided the fact that such division was not required, both fowls being regarded as one part of the sacrifice only, and each, as the half, being placed opposite the other. Wordsworth numbers seven parts in the sacrifice, and sees a symbol of completeness and finality, the number seven being the root of <span class="accented">shaba</span>, to swear (Gesenius, p. 802); Kalisch reckons four, which he regards as "denoting perfection, but rather the external perfection of form than the internal one of the mind," and pointing "to the perfect possession of the Holy Land." The ritual here described is the same which was afterwards observed among the Hebrews in the formation of covenants (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-18.htm">Genesis 34:18</a>), and appears to have extensively prevailed among heathen nations (cf. ' Iliad,' b. 124, "<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>;" and the Latin phrase, "<span class="accented">foedus</span> icere"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:7-11 Assurance was given to Abram of the land of Canaan for an inheritance. God never promises more than he is able to perform, as men often do. Abram did as God commanded him. He divided the beasts in the midst, according to the ceremony used in confirming covenants, Jer 34:18,19. Having prepared according to God's appointment, he set himself to wait for the sign God might give him. A watch must be kept upon our spiritual sacrifices. When vain thoughts, like these fowls, come down upon our sacrifices, we must drive them away, and seek to attend on God without distraction.</body></html>
