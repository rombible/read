The morning had been spent in the performance of the command, and after wards he had watched, probably for several hours, by the side of the divided bodies, uncertain what would happen, but occupied in driving away the vultures, which gathered from all quarters round the abundant feast. At sunset the revelation came to him, not in a waking trance, as on the previous night, but in "a deep sleep," and with those accompaniments of terror so powerfully described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/4-12.htm" title="Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof.">Job 4:12-16</a>, and which the creature cannot but feel when brought near to the manifest presence of the Creator (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-8.htm" title="Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.">Daniel 10:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">lo, a terror, even great darkness, falling upon him. </span>The terror was not mental so much as bodily, caused by a deep gloom settling round him, such as would be the effect of an eclipse of the setting sun, and shutting all mortal things away from his view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the sun was going down.</span> Literally, was about to go down (cf.

The children of light do not always walk in the light. Several things were then foretold. 1. The suffering state of Abram's seed for a long time. They shall be strangers. The heirs of heaven are strangers on earth. They shall be servants; but Canaanites serve under a curse, the Hebrews under a blessing. They shall be suffers. Those that are blessed and beloved of God, are often sorely afflicted by wicked men. 2. The judgment of the enemies of Abram's seed. Though God may allow persecutors and oppressors to trample upon his people a great while, he will certainly reckon with them at last. 3. That great event, the deliverance of Abram's seed out of Egypt, is here foretold. 4. Their happy settlement in Canaan. They shall come hither again. The measure of sin fills gradually. Some people's measure of sin fills slowly. The knowledge of future events would seldom add to our comfort. In the most favoured families, and most happy lives, there are so many afflictions, that it is merciful in God to conceal what will befall us and ours.</body></html>
