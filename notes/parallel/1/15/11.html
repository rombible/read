It does not appear necessary to attach any special significance to the descent of the vultures, which are always attracted towards carrion, and the introduction of which here completes the naturalness of the scene - <span class="cmt_word">came down upon the caresses</span> (the LXX. interpolates, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>Abram drove them away.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">caused them to be blown away, i.e.</span> by blowing. "Though Abram is here represented as the instrument, yet the effect is to be ascribed primarily to the tutelar agency of omnipotence" (Bush; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-31.htm">Ezekiel 21:31</a>). The act of scaring the voracious birds has been taken to represent the ease with which Abram or Israel would ward off his enemies (Jonathan, Targums, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bush); the averting of destruction from the Israelites through Abram's merit (Kalisch, Keil); Abram's religious regard for and observance of God's treaty (Wordsworth); the patriarch's expectation that God was about to employ the sacrificial victims for some holy purpose (Alford); simply his anxiety to preserve the victims pure and un-mutilated for whatever end they might have to serve (Murphy). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:7-11 Assurance was given to Abram of the land of Canaan for an inheritance. God never promises more than he is able to perform, as men often do. Abram did as God commanded him. He divided the beasts in the midst, according to the ceremony used in confirming covenants, Jer 34:18,19. Having prepared according to God's appointment, he set himself to wait for the sign God might give him. A watch must be kept upon our spiritual sacrifices. When vain thoughts, like these fowls, come down upon our sacrifices, we must drive them away, and seek to attend on God without distraction.</body></html>
