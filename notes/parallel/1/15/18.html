The northern capital of their empire was Carchemish, about sixteen miles south of the modern Birejik; and the southern Kadesh, on an island of the Orontes (Prof. Sayce in 'Frazer's Magazine,' August, 1880, art. 'A forgotten Empire in Asia Minor') - <span class="cmt_word">and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Oirgashites, and the Jebusites</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-19</a>).

It is probable that this furnace and lamp, which passed between the pieces, burned and consumed them, and so completed the sacrifice, and testified God's acceptance of it. So it intimates that God's covenants with man are made by sacrifice, Ps 50:5. And we may know that he accepts our sacrifices, if he kindles in our souls pious and devout affections. The bounds of the land granted are stated. Several nations, or tribes, are spoken of, that must be cast out to make room for the seed of Abram. In this chapter we perceive in Abram faith struggling against, and triumphing over, unbelief. Wonder not, believers, if you meet with seasons of darkness and distress. But it is not the will of God that you should be cast down: fear not; for all that he was to Abram he will be to you.</body></html>
