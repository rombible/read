Other authorities derive <span class= "ital">meshek </span>from a verb signifying "to run about," as if it was Eliezer's business to go to and fro in execution of Abram's orders. The term is rare, and has evidently been chosen for the play of words upon <span class= "ital">Dammesek= </span>Damascus. Perhaps this may also explain the last words, which literally are, <span class= "ital">he is Damascus Eliezer. </span>Grammatically it should have been, "he is the Damascene Eliezer," but this would have spoiled the assonance between <span class= "ital">ben-meshek </span>(probably pronounced <span class= "ital">bemmeshek</span>) and <span class= "ital">Dammesek.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abram said, Lord God.</span> <span class="accented">Adonai Jehovah</span>; the first use of these terms in combination, the second, which usually has the vowel-points of the first, being here written with the vocalization of Elohim. <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, an older plural form of <span class="accented">Adonim, pluralis excellentive</span> (Gesenius), though by some the termination is regarded as a suffix (Ewald, Furst), is a term descriptive of the Divine sovereignty, from <span class="accented">adan = dun</span>, or <span class="accented">din, to</span> rule or judge; connected with which is the Phoenician aden, an honorary epithet of deity, and recognized as such in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a> (<span class="accented">vide Furst</span>, 'Hebrew Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>What wilt thou give me, seeing I go literally</span>, <span class="accented">and I going - </span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (LXX., Jonathan); <span class="accented">ex hac vita discedam</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but this, though the word "go" is sometimes used in the sense of "die" (Psalm 39:14), does not seem necessary - <span class="cmt_word">childless</span> - solitary, desolate, hence devoid of offspring, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-20.htm">Leviticus 20:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a> - and the <span class="accented">steward - Ben-Meshek</span>; either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the son of running (from <span class="accented">shakak</span>, to run) <span class="accented"> = filius dis-cursitatis, i.e.</span> the steward who attends to my domestic affairs (Onkelos, Drusius); or, and with greater probability, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the son of possession (from <span class="accented">mashak</span>, to hold),. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the possessor of my house, or heir of my property (Gesenius, Furst, Delitzsch, Keel, Halisch) - <span class="cmt_word">of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">Dammesek Eliezer</span>. The paronomasia of this utterance is apparent, and was obviously designed to impart a touch of pathos to the patriarch's grief by pointing out the coincidence that the <span class="accented">Ben</span>-<span class="accented">shek</span> of his house was either <span class="accented">Dammesek</span> (Damascus) in the person of Eliezer (Delitzsch, Keil), or the Damascene Eliezer (Onkelos, Syriac, Aben Ezra, Calvin, Lange, Murphy), or <span class="accented">Dammesek-Eliezer</span> as one word (Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:2-6 Though we must never complain of God, yet we have leave to complain to him; and to state all our grievances. It is ease to a burdened spirit, to open its case to a faithful and compassionate friend. Abram's complaint is, that he had no child; that he was never likely to have any; that the want of a son was so great a trouble to him, that it took away all his comfort. If we suppose that Abram looked no further than outward comfort, this complaint was to be blamed. But if we suppose that Abram herein had reference to the promised Seed, his desire was very commendable. Till we have evidence of our interest in Christ, we should not rest satisfied; what will all avail me, if I go Christless? If we continue instant in prayer, yet pray with humble submission to the Divine will, we shall not seek in vain. God gave Abram an express promise of a son. Christians may believe in God with respect to the common concerns of this life; but the faith by which they are justified, always has respect to the person and work of Christ. Abram believed in God as promising Christ; they believe in him as having raised him from the dead, Ro 4:24. Through faith in his blood they obtain forgiveness of sins.</body></html>
