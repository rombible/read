for he lost thereby the companionship of the relative who had shared his abandonment of his country, and whom, probably, in his childless state, he had regarded as his heir. Jehovah, therefore, consoles him by a more definite promise of the possession of the whole land of which he had so generously given Lot the choice, and by the assurance that his own seed should be numerous as the dust of the earth. We may also feel sure that as Lot was deteriorating, so Abram was drawing nearer to God, and walking more closely with Him; and hence the fuller assurance of the Divine blessing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said</span> - speaking probably with an articulate voice; the third occasion on which the patriarch was directly addressed by God. The narrative, however, does not affirm that there was any actual theophany - <span class="cmt_word">unto Abram</span> - who could readily recognize the voice which had twice already spoken to him. <span class="cmt_word">After that Lot was separated from him.</span> Thus God approved that separation (Peele), and administered consolation to the troubled heart of the patriarch (Calvin), though Divine revelations are rather wont to be made to minds already quiet and sedate (Lyra). <span class="cmt_word">Lift up now thine eyes.</span> Perhaps a studied reference to the act of Lot, which Moses describes in similar language (ver. 10), and possibly designed to suggest the greater satisfaction which would be imparted to the soul of Abram by the survey about to be made. <span class="cmt_word">And look from the place where thou art</span>. Between Bethel and Ai, on cue of the mountain peaks (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>), from which a commanding view of almost the entire country could be obtained. <span class="cmt_word">Northward</span> - towards "the hills which divide Judaea from the rich plains of Samaria" - <span class="cmt_word">and southward</span> - as far as to the Hebron range - <span class="cmt_word">and eastward</span> - in the direction of the dark mountain wall of Moab, down through the rich ravine which leads from the central hills of Palestine to the valley of the Jordan, and across that very "circle" into which Lot has already departed with his flocks - <span class="cmt_word">and westward</span> - literally, <span class="accented">towards the sea</span>. Cf. on the view from the stony but fertile plateau between Bethel and Ai, Stanley's ' Sinai and Palestine,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>. p. 218. <span class="cmt_word">For all the land which thou seest</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the entire country, a part being put for the whole - <span class="cmt_word">to thee will I give it.</span> To avoid an apparent conflict between this Divine declaration and the words of Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-5.htm">Acts 7:5</a>), it is proposed by some to read the next clause as epexegetic of the present (Ainsworth, Bush); but the land was really given to Abram as a nomade chief, in the sense that he peacefully lived for many years, grew old, and died within its borders (Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'), while it was assigned to his descendants only because it had been first donated to him. <span class="cmt_word">And to thy seed.</span> Not his bodily posterity alone, to whom the terrestrial Canaan was given, but also and chiefly his spiritual family, to whom was made over that better country, even an heavenly, of which the land of promise was a type. <span class="cmt_word">Forever</span>. '<span class="accented">Adh</span> '<span class="accented">olam</span> (<span class="accented">vide on Genesis</span> 9:16) = = in perpetuity; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the close of that clam or period which was already measured out in the secret counsels of Jehovah for the duration of the seed of Abraham as a people, "quum terra in seculum promittitur, non simpliciter notatur. perpetuitas, sed quae finem accepit in Christo" (Calvin); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> unto eternity, in so far as it was a promise of a spiritual inheritance to Abraham's believing children. Thus as the promise did not preclude the expulsion of unbelieving Israel from the land, so neither does it guarantee to existing Jews a return to the earthly Paradise (Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:14-18 Those are best prepared for the visits of Divine grace, whose spirits are calm, and not ruffled with passion. God will abundantly make up in spiritual peace, what we lose for preserving neighbourly peace. When our relations are separated from us, yet God is not. Observe also the promises with which God now comforted and enriched Abram. Of two things he assures him; a good land, and a numerous issue to enjoy it. The prospects seen by faith are more rich and beautiful than those we see around us. God bade him walk through the land, not to think of fixing in it, but expect to be always unsettled, and walking through it to a better Canaan. He built an altar, in token of his thankfulness to God. When God meets us with gracious promises, he expects that we should attend him with humble praises. In outward difficulties, it is very profitable for the true believer to mediate on the glorious inheritance which the Lord has for him at the last.</body></html>
