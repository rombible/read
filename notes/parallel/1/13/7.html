As thus some districts would be occupied by the dominant Canaanites, and others by these aborigines, two such large clans as those of Abram and Lot would find it difficult to discover unoccupied land enough to provide pasture for their cattle. The land must have been very thinly peopled for it to have been possible for them to do this, even when they had arranged to dwell apart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a strife</span> (originating doubtless in the scarcity of pasture, and having for its object the possession of the best wells and most fertile grounds) <span class="cmt_word">between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite</span> - the lowlander (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 9:22; 12:6) - <span class="cmt_word">and the Perizzite</span> - the highlander, or dweller in the hills and woods of Palestine (Josephus, Bochart); in the open country and in villages, as opposed to the Canaanites, who occupied walled towns (Kalisch, Wordsworth; a tribe of wandering nomads (Murphy), the origin of whose name is lost in obscurity (Keil), who, though not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, are commonly introduced with the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>), as dividing the land between them, and are probably to be regarded as the remnant of an early Shemite race displaced by the Hamite invaders of Palestine. Their introduction here is neither a sign of post-Mosaic authorship nor an interpolation, but an explanation of the difficulty of finding pasture - the land was occupied (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">dwelt then in the land.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:5-9 Riches not only afford matter for strife, and are the things most commonly striven about; but they also stir up a spirit of contention, by making people proud and covetous. Mine and thine are the great make-bates of the world. Poverty and labour, wants and wanderings, could not separate Abram and Lot; but riches did so. Bad servants often make a great deal of mischief in families and among neighbours, by their pride and passion, lying, slandering, and talebearing. What made the quarrel worse was, that the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land. The quarrels of professors are the reproach of religion, and give occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme. It is best to keep the peace, that it be not broken; but the next best is, if differences do happen, with all speed to quench the fire that is broken out. The attempt to stay this strife was made by Abram, although he was the elder and the greater man. Abram shows himself to be a man of cool spirit, that had the command of his passion, and knew how to turn away wrath by a soft answer. Those that would keep the peace, must never render railing for railing. And of a condescending spirit; he was willing to beseech even his inferior to be at peace. Whatever others are for, the people of God must be for peace. Abram's plea for peace was very powerful. Let the people of the land contend about trifles; but let not us fall out, who know better things, and look for a better country. Professors of religion should be most careful to avoid contention. Many profess to be for peace who will do nothing towards it: not so Abram. When God condescends to beseech us to be reconciled, we may well beseech one another. Though God had promised Abram to give this land to his seed, yet he offered an equal or better share to Lot, who had not an equal right; and he will not, under the protection of God's promise, act hardly to his kinsman. It is noble to be willing to yield for peace' sake.</body></html>
