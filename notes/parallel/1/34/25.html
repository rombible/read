And it seems that these two were the leaders in the plot, having probably excluded Reuben from it, as a man of feeble character and opposed to bloodshed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-22.htm" title="And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand on him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.">Genesis 37:22</a>); and Judah, as one too honourable to take part in so nefarious a transaction. Long afterwards Jacob speaks of it in terms of the strongest reprobation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/49-5.htm" title="Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). In executing their cruel deed, they would command the services of the more active and fierce portion of Jacob's servants; but they must have been not boys, but men of ripe manhood, before they could have had influence or power enough for so terrible an exploit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">in their being in pain</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> (LXX.). Inflammation and fever commonly set in on the third day, which was for that reason regarded as the critical day - <span class="cmt_word">that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> sons of the same mother, Leah), <span class="cmt_word">took each man his sword,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and came upon the city</span> - accompanied by their servants (Keil), or their father's men (Murphy), but this is doubtful (Lange). That the other sons of Jacob and brethren of Dinah did not pursue their thirst for vengeance to the same extremity as Simeon and Levi seems apparent from ver. 27; yet it is quite possible that they joined with Simeon and Levi in the assault upon the city (Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary') which they made - boldly, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either they themselves feeling confident of success because of the sickness which lay upon the inhabitants (Ainsworth, Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy, etc.), or, while the city was lulled into security in consequence of the treaty (Onkelos, Josephus, Keil, Lange), or perhaps referring only to the fact that they encountered no opposition, and came in safety (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) to the city (LXX., Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and slew all the males</span>. Probably the town was small. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:20-31 The Shechemites submitted to the sacred rite, only to serve a turn, to please their prince, and to enrich themselves, and it was just with God to bring punishment upon them. As nothing secures us better than true religion, so nothing exposes us more than religion only pretended to. But Simeon and Levi were most unrighteous. Those who act wickedly, under the pretext of religion, are the worst enemies of the truth, and harden the hearts of many to destruction. The crimes of others form no excuse for us. Alas! how one sin leads on to another, and, like flames of fire, spread desolation in every direction! Foolish pleasures lead to seduction; seduction produces wrath; wrath thirsts for revenge; the thirst of revenge has recourse to treachery; treachery issues in murder; and murder is followed by other lawless actions. Were we to trace the history of unlawful commerce between the sexes, we should find it, more than any other sin, ending in blood.</body></html>
