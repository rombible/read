but it was aroused by a great wrong. The use, however, of the term <span class= "ital">Israel </span>to signify the family of Jacob as distinguished from his person belongs to the age of Moses, and is one of the proofs of the arrangement of these records having been his work. In selecting them, and weaving them together into one history, he would add whatever was necessary, and in the latter half of this verse we apparently have one such addition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of Jacob</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Leah's children, Dinah's full brothers, for certain, though perhaps also her half brothers) <span class="cmt_word">came out of the field when they heard it</span> (Jacob having probably sent them word): <span class="cmt_word">and the men were grieved</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">grieved themselves</span>, or became pained with anger, the verb being the hithpael of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to toil or labor with pain.

Michaelis mentions an opinion still entertained in the East which explains the excessive indignation kindled in the breasts of Dinah's brothers, vie., that "in those countries it is thought that a brother is more dishonored by the seduction of his sister than a man by the infidelity of his wife; for, say the Arabs, a man may divorce his wife, and then she is no longer his; while a sister and daughter remain always sister and daughter" (vide Kurtz, 'Hist. of Old Covenant,' (82) - <span class="cmt_word">because he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Shechem) - <span class="cmt_word">had wrought folly</span>. - the term <span class="accented">folly</span> easily passes into the idea of wickedness of a shameful character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-12.htm">2 Samuel 13:12</a>), since from the standpoint of Scripture sin is the height of unreason (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-22.htm">Psalm 74:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>), and holiness the sublimest act of wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>) - in (or against) <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span> - the word, here applied for the first time to Jacob's household, afterwards became the usual national designation of Jacob's descendants; and the phrase here employed for the first time afterwards passed into a standing expression for acts done against the sacred character which belonged to Israel as a separated and covenanted community, especially for sins of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>), but also for other crimes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">in lying with Jacob's daughter</span>. The special wickedness of Shechem consisted in dishonoring a daughter of one who was the head of the theocratic line, and therefore under peculiar obligations to lead s holy life. <span class="cmt_word">Which thing ought not to be done</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and so is it not done</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-26.htm">Genesis 29:26</a>). Assigned to the historian ('Speaker's Commentary'), or to the hand of a late redactor (Davidson, Colenso, Alford), there is no reason why these words should not have been spoken by Jacob's sons (Keil, Murphy, and others)' to indicate their sense of the new and higher morality that had come in with the name of Israel (Lange). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-19 Young persons, especially females, are never so safe and well off as under the care of pious parents. Their own ignorance, and the flattery and artifices of designing, wicked people, who are ever laying snares for them, expose them to great danger. They are their own enemies if they desire to go abroad, especially alone, among strangers to true religion. Those parents are very wrong who do not hinder their children from needlessly exposing themselves to danger. Indulged children, like Dinah, often become a grief and shame to their families. Her pretence was, to see the daughters of the land, to see how they dressed, and how they danced, and what was fashionable among them; she went to see, yet that was not all, she went to be seen too. She went to get acquaintance with the Canaanites, and to learn their ways. See what came of Dinah's gadding. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. How great a matter does a little fire kindle! We should carefully avoid all occasions of sin and approaches to it.</body></html>
