Jacob, therefore, proposes that all such shall belong to Laban, but that the parti-coloured should be his hire.

Besides these, Jacob is to have all "brown cattle," that is, <span class= "ital">sheep, </span>for the word "cattle" is usually now confined to kine, which was not the case 200 years ago. This translation is taken from Rashi, but the word usually signifies <span class= "ital">black. </span>Philippsohn says that black sheep are seldom seen in the East, but that sheep of a blackish-red colour are common. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-35.htm" title="And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.">Genesis 30:35</a> we have another word, "ring-straked," that is, having the colours in stripes. This is never the case with sheep, but goats often have their coats thus definitely marked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will pass through all thy flock today</span>, - wrongly rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX), <span class="accented">gyra per omnes greges tuos</span> (Vulgate}, as if Jacob proposed that the separation of the flocks should be effected by Laban, and not by himself - <span class="cmt_word">removing from thence</span> - not remove thou, as if the verb were imperative (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy, Kalisch), but "to remove," the verb being in the inf.

Since in Oriental countries sheep are commonly white and goats black, the number of speckled and spotted animals (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sheep with little spots and largo patches of black, and goats with little or large points of white, in their hair) would be unusually small. <span class="cmt_word">And of such shall be my hire</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the dark-spotted or entirely black sheep and white or white-speckled goats were to be Jacob's reward (Knobel, Delitzsch, Keil, Lunge), which was to be subsequently increased by whatever speckled animals might appear among the one-colored flocks; but it seems more probable that Jacob only claimed the latter, and, both to make the bargain more attractive to Laban and to show that he wanted nothing from Laban but only what God might be pleased in accordance with this arrangement to bestow, he suggested that the flocks and herds should be purged of all such speckled and spotted animals to begin with (Tuch, Baumgarten, Kurtz, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Candlish; Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Clarke, Bush). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:25-43 The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without any provision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claim on Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.</body></html>
