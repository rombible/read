Moreover, Jacob had other daughters besides Dinah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm" title="And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.">Genesis 37:35</a>), and probably by these handmaids. We may well believe, therefore, that Reuben at this timewas from fifteen to twenty years of age, and might be trusted to wander at his will over the wild uncultivated waste.<p><span class= "bld">In the days of wheat harvest.</span>--This is mentioned to fix the time, namely, early in May. As Laban led a settled life, he may have grown wheat, as Jacob did in Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-7.htm" title="For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, see, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.">Genesis 37:7</a>), but mandrakes would most assuredly not be found on tilled land.<p><span class= "bld">Mandrakes.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">love-apples. </span>It is generally agreed that the fruit meant is that of the <span class= "ital">Atropa mandragora, </span>which ripens in May, and is of the size of a small plum, round, yellow, and full of soft pulp. The plant belongs to the same family (the <span class= "ital">Solanace?</span>) as the potato, and the <span class= "ital">egg </span>plant, the fruit of which is largely used as a vegetable in North America.<p>The mandragora has a long carrot-shaped root, from which grows a mass of leaves of a greyish colour, not unlike those of the primrose, but larger, and which lie flat upon the ground, and from among them rise blossoms, singly, of a rich purple colour. Canon Tristram (<span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bible, </span>p. 467) says that the fruit is not unpleasant, and that he has often eaten of it without experiencing any soporific or other bad effect. But in the East it has been, and is, the subject of many superstitions, and its Hebrew name arose from the popular belief that it was a specific against barrenness. Rachel, therefore, who still hankered after children of her own, was anxious to obtain some of the fruit, and Leah consents only upon the proffered condition that Jacob shall spend the night in her tent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Reuben</span> (at this time four or five years old) <span class="cmt_word">went</span> (probably accompanying the reapers) <span class="cmt_word">in the days of wheat harvest</span> (in the beginning of May), <span class="cmt_word">and found mandrakes</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (LXX., Josephus), apples of the mandragora, an herb resembling belladonna, with a root like a carrot, having white and reddish blossoms of a sweet smell, and with yellow odoriferous apples, ripening in May and June, and supposed, according to Oriental superstition, to possess the virtue of conciliating love and promoting fruitfulness (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, p. 191, and cf.
