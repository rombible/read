Great as was the affliction to a Hebrew woman of being barren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-10.htm" title="And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept sore.">1Samuel 1:10</a>), yet there is a painful petulance and peevishness about Rachel's words, in strong contrast with Hannah's patient suffering. But she was very young, and a spoiled wife; though with qualities which riveted Jacob's love to her all life through.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Rachel saw</span> (apparently after, though probably before, the birth of Leah's fourth son) <span class="cmt_word">that she bare Jacob no children</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that she bare not to Jacob</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Rachel envied her sister</span> (was jealous of her, the root referring to the redness with which the face of an angry woman is suffused); <span class="cmt_word">and said unto Jacob, Give me children</span> (sons), <span class="cmt_word">or else I die</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and if not</span>, <span class="accented">I am a dead woman</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for shame at her sterility. Rachel had three strong reasons for desiring children - that she might emulate her sister, become more dear to her husband, and above all share the hope of being a progenitrix of the promised Seed. If not warranted to infer that Rachel s barrenness was due to lack of prayer on her part and Jacob s (Keil), we are at least justified in asserting that her conduct in breaking forth into angry reproaches against her husband was unlike that of Jacob's mother, Rebekah, who, in similar circumstances, sought relief in prayer and oracles (Kalisch). The brief period that had elapsed since Rachel's marriage, in comparison with the twenty years of Rebekah's barrenness, signally discovered Rachel's sinful impatience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-13 Rachel envied her sister: envy is grieving at the good of another, than which no sin is more hateful to God, or more hurtful to our neighbours and ourselves. She considered not that God made the difference, and that in other things she had the advantage. Let us carefully watch against all the risings and workings of this passion in our minds. Let not our eye be evil towards any of our fellow-servants, because our Master's is good. Jacob loved Rachel, and therefore reproved her for what she said amiss. Faithful reproofs show true affection. God may be to us instead of any creature; but it is sin and folly to place any creature in God's stead, and to place that confidence in any creature, which should be placed in God only. At the persuasion of Rachel, Jacob took Bilhah her handmaid to wife, that, according to the usage of those times, her children might be owned as her mistress's children. Had not Rachel's heart been influenced by evil passions, she would have thought her sister's children nearer to her, and more entitled to her care than Bilhah's. But children whom she had a right to rule, were more desirable to her than children she had more reason to love. As an early instance of her power over these children, she takes pleasure in giving them names that carry in them marks of rivalry with her sister. See what roots of bitterness envy and strife are, and what mischief they make among relations. At the persuasion of Leah, Jacob took Zilpah her handmaid to wife also. See the power of jealousy and rivalship, and admire the wisdom of the Divine appointment, which joins together one man and one woman only; for God hath called us to peace and purity.</body></html>
