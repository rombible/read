He hearkens to her prayer, and remembers her. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-19.htm" title="And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.">1Samuel 1:19</a>.) In calling his name Joseph, there is again a play upon two words, for it may be formed from the verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-23.htm" title="And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God has taken away my reproach:">Genesis 30:23</a>, and would then mean <span class= "ital">he takes away; </span>or it may signify <span class= "ital">he adds, </span>which is the meaning made prominent by Rachel. And God did add to her another son, but the boon cost her her life. As Joseph was born six or seven years before Jacob left Padan-aram, Rachel had been barren for twenty-six years. We must add that in her joy at Joseph's birth there is no trace of the ungenerous triumph over Leah so marked in her rejoicing at the birth of the sons of Bilhah; and in her trust that "Jehovah would add to her another son," she evidently had in mind the covenant promises, which a son of her own womb might now inherit. As a matter of fact, the long struggle for supremacy lay between the houses of Joseph and Judah; and Judah finally prevailed.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God remembered Rachel</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and God hearkened to her</span>, - as to Leah (ver. 17) - <span class="cmt_word">and opened her womb</span> - as he had previously done to Leah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>). Rachel's barrenness had not continued so long as either Sarah's or Rebekah's. <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach</span> - i.e. of sterility. The mandrakes of Leah having proved inefficacious, Rachel at length realizes that children are God s gift, and this thought sufficiently explains the use of the term Elohim. <span class="cmt_word">And she called his name Joseph;</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>, either, "he takes away," with allusion to the removal of her reproach, or, "he shall add," with reference to her hope of another son. Perhaps the first thought is not obscurely hinted at, though the second appears' from the ensuing clause to have occupied the greater prominence in Rachel's mind - <span class="cmt_word">and said, The Lord</span> - Jehovah; a trace of the Jehovistic pen (Tuch, Bleek, <span class="accented">et alii</span>); rather an outcome of the higher spiritual life of Rachel, who had now got emancipated from all such merely human devices as resorting to mandrakes, and was able to recognize her complete dependence for offspring on the sovereign grace of the covenant God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob (Hengstenberg, Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">shall add to me another son.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 30:25-43 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:14-24 The desire, good in itself, but often too great and irregular, of being the mother of the promised Seed, with the honour of having many children, and the reproach of being barren, were causes of this unbecoming contest between the sisters. The truth appears to be, that they were influenced by the promises of God to Abraham; whose posterity were promised the richest blessings, and from whom the Messiah was to descend.</body></html>
