but, secondly, Leah gives it a higher meaning, "for God," she says, "hath given me my hire." In her eyes the birth of her fifth son was a Divine reward for the self-sacrifice involved in giving her maid to Jacob, and which had been followed by years of neglect of herself. As, too, it is said that "God hearkened unto Leah," we may feel sure that she had prayed for God's blessing upon her re-union with her husband; for Calvin's objection that prayer would scarcely accompany such odious courses has little weight. Leah and Rachel were uneducated and untrained country women, whose sole anxiety was to have offspring. Leah was the most religious and best disciplined of the two; and the shame ideally was that she should have been forced thus to buy her husband's attentions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Leah said, God</span> - Elohim; a proof of the lower religious consciousness into which Leah had fallen (Hengstenberg), though perhaps on the above hypothesis an e<span class="accented">vide</span>nce of her piety and faith (Keil, Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband</span>: - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as a reward for my self-denial (Keil, Murphy); an exclamation in which appears Leah's love for Jacob (Lange), if not also a tacit acknowledgment that she had her fears lest she may have sinned in asking him to wed Zilpah (Rosenm&uuml;ller) - <span class="cmt_word">and she called his name Issachar</span> - "There is Reward," or "There is Hire;" containing a double allusion to her hire of Jacob and her reward for Zilpah <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:14-24 The desire, good in itself, but often too great and irregular, of being the mother of the promised Seed, with the honour of having many children, and the reproach of being barren, were causes of this unbecoming contest between the sisters.
