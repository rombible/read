The authors of the Authorised Version evidently thought that Laban himself removed all speckled sheep and goats, and kept them; but the Hebrew is by no means so much in favour of this view as their own translation. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm" title="I will pass through all your flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.">Genesis 30:32</a> they insert "of such" in italics; the Hebrew distinctly says, <span class= "ital">And it shall be my hire: </span>that is, every one speckled or spotted shall be <span class= "ital">mine, </span>the singular number being used throughout. Next, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-33.htm" title="So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.">Genesis 30:33</a> they translate, <span class= "ital">in time to come: </span>according to this, if the particoloured sheep and goats at any time produced white or black lambs, as they generally would, such would revert to Laban; the Hebrew says, <span class= "ital">My righteousness shall answer for me to-morrow. </span>Jacob was to make the selection at once, but the next day Laban was to look over all those put aside, and if he found among them any white sheep, or black or brown goats, he was to regard them as stolen--that is, not merely might he take them back, but require the usual fine or compensation.<p><span class= "bld">And gave them into the hand of his sons.</span>--It has been assumed that these were Laban's sons, on the ground that Jacob's sons were not old enough to undertake the charge; but as Reuben was twenty-six, this was not the case. Jacob's flocks would have fared but badly if they had been entrusted to Laban's sons, nor could he, six years later, have escaped, had his property been in their keeping, without Laban being immediately aware of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - Laban (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Delitzsch, Kalisch, Murphy, <span class="accented">et alii</span>); Jacob (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">removed that day</span> (that the smallest possible chance of success might remain to his nephew) <span class="cmt_word">the he-goats that were ringstraked</span> (striped or banded) <span class="cmt_word">and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep,</span> - four sorts of animals were to be removed: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the dotted, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the patched, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the ring-marked or striped, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the black or brown - <span class="cmt_word">and gave them into the hand of his</span> (Laban's or Jacob's, <span class="accented">ut supra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>sons</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:25-43 The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without any provision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claim on Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.</body></html>
