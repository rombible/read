for she plays upon two words, which probably both belonged to the Mesopotamian <span class= "ital">pato is: </span>and as this was a Syriac dialect, we must look to that language for their explanation. The first is <span class= "ital">zebed; </span>and here there is no difficulty. It means such presents as a father gives his daughter on her marriage, over and above those enumerated in the marriage contract. Of the second, <span class= "ital">zabal, </span>there is no trace. Nor do the Syro-Arabic lexicons acknowledge in the word "Zebulun" such a sense as that of <span class= "ital">dwelling, </span>given it in our margin. Bar-Ali explains it as meaning "salvation of the night, or a good dowry," and Bar- Bahlul, "a dowry of the night," both deriving it from <span class= "ital">zebed, </span>a dowry, and <span class= "ital">lun, </span>to pass the night. The derivation is wrong as far as concerns <span class= "ital">lun; </span>for the word Zebulun is formed simply from <span class= "ital">zebed, </span>the final <span class= "ital">d </span>of which is changed into I for mere reasons of euphony. The Versions take the word <span class= "ital">zabal </span>as mean ing, "to be with," Vulg.; "to choose," LXX.; "to cleave to," Syriac. It occurs nowhere else, but the substantive <span class= "ital">zebul </span>is not uncommon, and means <span class= "ital">dwelling, station.</span><p>As a woman's value in the East rises with each son, Leah now hoped for more love from her husband. Nor does she seem to have been disappointed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:14-24 The desire, good in itself, but often too great and irregular, of being the mother of the promised Seed, with the honour of having many children, and the reproach of being barren, were causes of this unbecoming contest between the sisters. The truth appears to be, that they were influenced by the promises of God to Abraham; whose posterity were promised the richest blessings, and from whom the Messiah was to descend.</body></html>
