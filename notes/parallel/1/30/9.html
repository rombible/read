The struggle of these two women for the husband gives us a strange picture of manners and morals, but must not be judged by our standard. Leah herself regards the bestowal of her handmaid upon Jacob as a deserving act of self-sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-18.htm" title="And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.">Genesis 30:18</a>). The names, moreover, which she gives to Zilpah's children show that the happier frame of mind to which she had attained when she called her fourth son "Judah," <span class= "ital">praise, </span>remained unbroken. On the birth of the first, she says, "With good luck!" and calls his name "Gad," that is, <span class= "ital">luck. </span>The Jews read, in their synagogue, <span class= "ital">Luck cometh, </span>whence the rendering of the Authorised Version, "A troop cometh;" but there is no justification for the change. With regard to the meaning of the word "Gad," all the Versions render it <span class= "ital">prosperity, good fortune. </span>Nor is the Samaritan, as has been alleged, an exception; for though the worthless Latin translation of it has "a troop cometh," the Samaritan itself has <span class= "ital">with good luck. </span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-11.htm" title="But you are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering to that number.">Isaiah 65:11</a> we find Gad used as the name of an idol. Zilpah's other son is called Asher, that is, <span class= "ital">happy, </span>in Latin Felix, and Leah says, "With my happiness," using just the same turn of speech as before. The first child came bringing <span class= "ital">her </span>good luck; the second brought her happiness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Leah saw that she had left bearing</span> (literally, <span class="accented">stood from bearing</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>), <span class="cmt_word">she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her to Jacob to wife</span> - being in this led astray by Rachel's sinful example, both as to the spirit of unholy rivalry she cherished, and the questionable means she employed for its gratification. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-13 Rachel envied her sister: envy is grieving at the good of another, than which no sin is more hateful to God, or more hurtful to our neighbours and ourselves. She considered not that God made the difference, and that in other things she had the advantage. Let us carefully watch against all the risings and workings of this passion in our minds. Let not our eye be evil towards any of our fellow-servants, because our Master's is good. Jacob loved Rachel, and therefore reproved her for what she said amiss. Faithful reproofs show true affection. God may be to us instead of any creature; but it is sin and folly to place any creature in God's stead, and to place that confidence in any creature, which should be placed in God only. At the persuasion of Rachel, Jacob took Bilhah her handmaid to wife, that, according to the usage of those times, her children might be owned as her mistress's children. Had not Rachel's heart been influenced by evil passions, she would have thought her sister's children nearer to her, and more entitled to her care than Bilhah's. But children whom she had a right to rule, were more desirable to her than children she had more reason to love. As an early instance of her power over these children, she takes pleasure in giving them names that carry in them marks of rivalry with her sister. See what roots of bitterness envy and strife are, and what mischief they make among relations. At the persuasion of Leah, Jacob took Zilpah her handmaid to wife also. See the power of jealousy and rivalship, and admire the wisdom of the Divine appointment, which joins together one man and one woman only; for God hath called us to peace and purity.</body></html>
