The words "and Jacob fed," &c., are added to correct the natural supposition that he would at least give some part of his time and care to his own flocks, whereas it was his personal duty to attend only to those of Laban. The verse, nevertheless, is awkward, and the Syriac has probably preserved the right-reading: "And he set three days' journey between himself and Laban: and Jacob fed the flock of Laban that was left." The Samaritan and LXX. read, "between them and Jacob."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (as if to insure the impossibility of the two flocks mingling and breeding) <span class="cmt_word">he set three days journey betwixt himself</span> (with his sons and the parti-colored animals) <span class="cmt_word">and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks</span> - out of which he was to pay himself as best he could in accordance with the contract. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:25-43 The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without any provision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claim on Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.</body></html>
