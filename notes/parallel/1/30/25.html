During most of this time he would be too encumbered with pregnant wives and young children to wish to take so long a journey. (See "Excursus on Chronology of Jacob's Life.") In these thirty-four years of service there would be time for the vast increase of Laban's wealth referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm" title="For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?">Genesis 30:30</a>. But at length Joseph is born, and as his other sons were most of them grown to man's estate, as soon as Rachel was fit for the journey Jacob desired to return to his father, if for no other reason, yet because now it was time to provide for his children, and at Isaac's death he was joint heir of his property.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph</span>, - either at or about the expiry of the second term of seven years. Jacob's family now consisted in all of eleven sons and one daughter, unless Dinah's birth occurred later in the next term of service (Keil). Since these were all born within seven years, the chronological cannot be the order observed by the historian in recording the events of the preceding paragraphs. Rather the births of the children are arranged in connection with the mothers from whom they sprang. Hence the possibility of acquiring so large a family in so short a time. The six sons of Leah might be born in the seven years, allowing one year's complete cessation from pregnancy, viz., the fifth; Bilhah's in the third and fourth years; Zilpah's in the beginning of the sixth and seventh; and Rachel's toward the end of the seventh, leaving Dinah to be born later (cf. Keil in <span class="accented">loco</span>) <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>that Jacob said unto Laban</span> (if not immediately, certainly soon, after Joseph's birth), <span class="cmt_word">Send me away</span> (meaning that Laban should permit him to depart), <span class="cmt_word">that I may go</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and I will go</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto mine own place, and to my country</span> - to Canaan in general, and to that part of it in particular where he had formerly resided (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-55.htm">Genesis 31:55</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:25-43 The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without any provision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claim on Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.</body></html>
