As we have no data about the migration of Terah, except that it was after the death of Haran, and that Haran left children, we cannot tell how long the family rested at their first halting place, but it was probably a period of several years; and as Abram was "very rich in silver and in gold," he had apparently engaged there in trade, and thus possibly knew the course which the caravans took.<p><span class= "bld">The souls that they had gotten.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">had made. </span>Onkelos and the Jewish interpreters explain this of proselytes, and persons whom they had converted to the faith in one God. Such might probably be in Abram's company; but the most part were his dependents and slaves (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm" title="And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.">Genesis 14:14</a>,), though the word "slave" suggests a very different relation to us than that which existed between Abram and his household. Their descendants were most certainly incorporated into the Israelitish nation, and we have direct testimony that Abram gave them careful religious training (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm" title="For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.">Genesis 18:19</a>). Thus the Jewish traditions record a fact, and by acknowledging Abram's household as proselytes admit their claim to incorporation with the race.<p><span class= "bld">Into the land of Canaan they came.</span>--Slowly and leisurely as the cattle with their young and the women and children could travel, Abram would take his way along the 300 miles which separated him from Canaan. The ford by which he crossed the Euphrates was probably that at Jerabolus, the ancient Carchemish, as the route this way is both more direct and more fertile than either that which leads to the ferry of Bir or that by Thapsacus. The difficulty of passing so great a river with so much substance, and people, and cattle would give fresh importance to his title of "the Hebrew," <span class= "ital">the passer over, </span>already his by right of descent from Eber, so named from the passage of the Tigris. More correctly, these names are 'Eber and 'Ebrew, and have nothing in common with "Heber the Kenite" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm" title="Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.">Judges 4:11</a>). From Carchemish Abram's route would lie to the south-west, by Tadmor and Damascus; and Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antiq., </span>i. 7) has preserved the legend that "Abram came with an army from the country beyond Babylon, and conquered Damascus, and reigned there for a short time, after which he migrated into the land of Canaan." In Eliezer of Damascus we have a reminiscence of Abram's halt there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>). But it could not have been long, for Mr. Malan (<span class= "ital">Philosophy or Truth, </span>pp. 98-143) has conclusively shown by the dates in Holy Scripture that only about a year elapsed between Abram's departure from Kharan and his settlement in Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abram took</span> (an important addition to the foregoing statement, intimating that Abram did not go forth as a lonely wanderer, but accompanied by) <span class="cmt_word">Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all the substance</span> - <span class="accented">recush</span>, acquired wealth, from <span class="accented">racash</span>, to gain (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-11.htm">Genesis 14:11, 16, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>), which consisted chiefly in cattle, Lot and Abram being nomads - <span class="cmt_word">that they had gathered</span> (not necessarily implying a protracted stay, as some allege), <span class="cmt_word">and the souls</span> - here slaves and their children (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">that they had gotten</span> - "not only as secular property for themselves, but as brethren to themselves, and as children of the one heavenly Father" (Wordsworth); that they had converted to the law (Onkelos); that they had proselyted (Raschi, Targam Jonathan, and Jerusalem Targum) - <span class="cmt_word">in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan</span>; - a prolepsis (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, q.v.) - <span class="cmt_word">and into the land of Canaan they came</span> - a distance of 300 miles from Haran, from which their course must have been across the Euphrates in one of its higher affluent, over the Syrian desert, southwards to Lebanon and Damascus (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), where, according to Josephus, the patriarch reigned for some considerable time, "being come with an army from the land of the Chaldaeans" ('Ant.,' 1:07), and a village survived to his day called "Abraham's habitation." According to the partitionists (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Davidson) this verse belongs to the Elohist or fundamental document; but if so, then the Jehovist represents Abram (ver. 6) as journeying through the land without having previously mentioned what land (cf. Quarry, p. 420). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:4,5 Abram believed that the blessing of the Almighty would make up for all he could lose or leave behind, supply all his wants, and answer and exceed all his desires; and he knew that nothing but misery would follow disobedience. Such believers, being justified by faith in Christ, have peace with God. They hold on their way to Canaan. They are not discouraged by the difficulties in their way, nor drawn aside by the delights they meet with. Those who set out for heaven must persevere to the end. What we undertake, in obedience to God's command, and in humble attendance on his providence, will certainly succeed, and end with comfort at last. Canaan was not, as other lands, a mere outward possession, but a type of heaven, and in this respect the patriarchs so earnestly prized it.</body></html>
