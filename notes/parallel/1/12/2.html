In return for all that he abandons he is to become the founder of a powerful nation, who will honour his name, and teach the inheritors of their spiritual privileges to share in their veneration for him. But in the command to "be" or "become a blessing," we reach a higher level, and it is the glory of Abram's faith that it was not selfish, and in return for his consenting to lead the life of a stranger, he was to be the means of procuring religious privileges, not only for his own descendants, but also "for all families of the earth" (Heb., <span class= "ital">of the ground</span>--<span class= "ital">the adamah</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Not for the earth as the material universe, but solely in its connection with man. Wherever man makes his home upon it, there, through Abram, spiritual blessings will be offered him.<p><span class= "bld">I will bless . . . --</span>These words indicate relations mysteriously close between Jehovah and Abram, whereby the friends and enemies of the one become so equally to the other. But in the second clause our version has not noticed an essential difference between the verbs used. They occur together again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>, and are there more correctly rendered by "revile" and "curse." The one word signifies to treat lightly and contemptuously, the other to pronounce a curse, usually in a judicial manner. We might, therefore, translate, "I will curse--pass a sentence of rejection upon--him that speaketh lightly of, or revileth thee."<p><span class= "bld">In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</span>--Some authorities translate, "shall bless themselves;" but there is a different conjugation to express this meaning, and no reason exists for forcing it upon the text. Henceforward Abram and the nation sprung from him were to be the intermediaries between God and mankind, and accordingly revelation was virtually confined to them. But though the knowledge of God's will was to be given through them, it was for the benefit of all the families of every race and kindred distributed throughout the habitable world, the <span class= "ital">adamah </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-29.htm" title="Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?

So God made David a great name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt be a blessing</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "blessed," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-12.htm">Zechariah 8:12</a> (Chaldee, Syriac, LXX., Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius); or "a type or example of blessing," so that men shall introduce thy name into their formularies of blessing (Kimchi, Clericus, Knobel, Calvin); but, best, "a source of blessing' (spiritual) to others" (Tuch, Delitzsch, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy). The sense in which Abram was to be a source of blessing to others is explained in the next verse. First, men were to be either blessed or cursed of God according as their attitude to Abram was propitious or hostile. <span class="cmt_word">And I will bless them</span> - grace expecting they will be many to bless (Delitzsch) - <span class="cmt_word">that bless thee, and curse</span> (with a judicial curse, the word being the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>) <span class="cmt_word">him</span> - only an individual here and there, in the judgment of the Deity, being likely to inherit this malediction (Delitzsch) - <span class="cmt_word">that curseth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">treateth lightly</span> or <span class="accented">despiseth</span> The verb is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a> to the diminution of the waters of the flood) <span class="cmt_word">thee</span>. The Divine Being thus identifies himself with Abram, and solemnly engages to regard Abrams friends and enemies as his, as Christ does with his Church (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</span> Not Mess themselves by thee or in thy name (Jarchi, Clericus); but in thee, as the progenitor of the promised seed, shall all the families of the ground (which was cursed on account of sin, Genesis ill 17) be spiritually blessed - cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a> (Calvin, Luther, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Wordsworth, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Thus the second sense in which Abram was constituted a blessing lay in this, that the whole fullness of the Divine promise of salvation for the world was narrowed up to his line, by which it was in future to be carried forward, and at the appointed season, when the woman s seed was horn, distributed among mankind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-3 God made choice of Abram, and singled him out from among his fellow-idolaters, that he might reserve a people for himself, among whom his true worship might be maintained till the coming of Christ. From henceforward Abram and his seed are almost the only subject of the history in the Bible. Abram was tried whether he loved God better than all, and whether he could willingly leave all to go with God. His kindred and his father's house were a constant temptation to him, he could not continue among them without danger of being infected by them. Those who leave their sins, and turn to God, will be unspeakable gainers by the change. The command God gave to Abram, is much the same with the gospel call, for natural affection must give way to Divine grace. Sin, and all the occasions of it, must be forsaken; particularly bad company. Here are many great and precious promises. All God's precepts are attended with promises to the obedient. 1. I will make of thee a great nation. When God took Abram from his own people, he promised to make him the head of another people. 2. I will bless thee. Obedient believers shall be sure to inherit the blessing. 3. I will make thy name great. The name of obedient believers shall certainly be made great. 4. Thou shalt be a blessing. Good men are the blessings of their country. 5. I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee. God will take care that none are losers, by any service done for his people. 6. In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Jesus Christ is the great blessing of the world, the greatest that ever the world possessed. All the true blessedness the world is now, or ever shall be possessed of, is owing to Abram and his posterity. Through them we have a Bible, a Saviour, and a gospel. They are the stock on which the Christian church is grafted.</body></html>
