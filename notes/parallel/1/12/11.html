Though its general meaning is <span class= "ital">beautiful, </span>yet there can be no doubt that the light colour of Sarai's complexion was that which would chiefly commend her to the Egyptians; for she was now past sixty, and though vigorous enough to bear a son at ninety, yet that was by the special favour of God. As she lived to the age of 127 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-1.htm" title="And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.">Genesis 23:1</a>), she was now about middle age, and evidently had retained much of her early beauty; and this, added to the difference of tint, would make her still attractive to the swarthy descendants of Ham, especially as they were not a handsome race, but had flat foreheads, high cheek-bones, large mouths, and thick lips. Twenty years later we find Abram still haunted by fears of the effects of her personal appearance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-2.htm" title="And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.">Genesis 20:2</a>), even when living among a better-featured race. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.">Genesis 20:13</a> it appears that on leaving Haran Abram and Sarai had agreed upon adopting this expedient, which seems to us so strangely contrary to the faith which the patriarch was at that very time displaying. He abandons his birthplace at the Divine command, and starts upon endless wanderings; and yet, to protect his own life, he makes an arrangement which involves the possible sacrifice of the chastity of his wife; and twice, but for God's interference, this painful result would actually have happened. Perhaps Abram may have depended upon Sarai's cleverness to help herself out of the difficulty; but such a mixture of faith and weakness, of trust in God in abandoning so much and trust in worldly policy for preservation in a foreseen danger, cannot but make us feel how much of infirmity there was even in a character otherwise so noble.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> (literally, <span class="accented">it was</span>), <span class="cmt_word">when he was come near to enter into Egypt</span> (that he had his misgivings, arising probably from his own eminence, which could scarcely fail to attract attention among strangers, but chiefly from the beauty of his wife, which was calculated to inflame the cupidity and, it might be, the violence of the warm-blooded Southrons, and) <span class="cmt_word">that he said unto Sarai his wife</span>. The arrangement here referred to appears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-13.htm">Genesis 20:13</a>) to have been preconcerted on first setting out from Ur or Haran, so that Abram's address to his wife on approaching Egypt may be viewed as simply a reminder of their previous compact. <span class="cmt_word">Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">fair of aspect</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>). Though now upwards of sixty-five years of age, she was still in middle life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-1.htm">Genesis 23:1</a>), and her constitution had not been impaired by bearing children. Besides, the clear complexion of Sarah would render her specially attractive in the eyes of the Egyptians, whose women, though not so dark as the Nubians and Ethiopians, were yet of a browner tinge than the Syrians and Arabians. Monumental evidence confirms the assertion of Scripture that a fair complexion was deemed a high recommendation in the age of the Pharaohs (<span class="accented">ride</span> Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 200). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">it shall come to pass, when</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that</span>) the Egyptians - notorious for their licentiousness (<span class="accented">vide</span> P. Smith's ' History of the World,' vol. 1. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>. p. 71) - <span class="cmt_word">shall see thee, that</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">they shall say, this is his wife: and they will kill me</span> - in order to possess thee, counting murder a less crime than adultery (Lyra). An unreasonable anxiety, considering that he had hitherto enjoyed the Divine protection, however natural it might seem in view of the voluptuous character of the people. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">they will save thee alive</span> - for either compulsory marriage or dishonorable use. <span class="cmt_word">Say, I pray thee</span>, - translated in ver. 11 as "now;" "verbum obsecrantis vel adhortantis" (Masius) - <span class="cmt_word">thou art my sister</span>. A half-truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>), but a whole falsehood. The usual apologies, that he did not fabricate, but "cautiously conceal the truth" (Lyra), that perhaps he acted in obedience to a Divine impulse (Mede), that he dissembled in order to protect his wife's chastity (Rosenm&uuml;ller), are not satisfactory. On the other hand, Abram must not be judged by the light of New Testament revelation. It is not necessary for a Christian in every situation Of life to tell all the truth, especially when its part suppression involves no deception, and is indispensable for self-preservation; and Abram may have deemed it legitimate as a means of securing both his own life and Sarah's honor, though how he was to shield his wife in the peculiar circumstances it is difficult to see. Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests that he knew the preliminary ceremonies to marriage required a considerable time, and counted upon being able to leave Egypt before any injury was done to Sarah. The only objection to this is that the historian represents him as being less solicitous about the preservation of his wife's chastity than about the conservation of his own life. <span class="cmt_word">That it may be well</span> (not with thee, though doubtless this is implied, but) <span class="cmt_word">with me for thy sake</span> (the import of which is declared in the words which follow); <span class="cmt_word">and my soul shall live because of thee</span>. "No defense can be offered for a man who, merely through dread of danger to himself, tells a lie, risks his wife's chastity, puts temptation in the way of his neighbors, and betrays the charge to which the Divine favor had summoned him "(Dykes). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:10-20 There is no state on earth free from trials, nor any character free from blemishes. There was famine in Canaan, the glory of all lands, and unbelief, with the evils it ever brings, in Abram the father of the faithful. Perfect happiness and perfect purity dwell only in heaven. Abram, when he must for a time quit Canaan, goes to Egypt, that he might not seem to look back, and meaning to tarry there no longer than needful. There Abram dissembled his relation to Sarai, equivocated, and taught his wife and his attendants to do so too. He concealed a truth, so as in effect to deny it, and exposed thereby both his wife and the Egyptians to sin. The grace Abram was most noted for, was faith; yet he thus fell through unbelief and distrust of the Divine providence, even after God had appeared to him twice. Alas, what will become of weak faith, when strong faith is thus shaken! If God did not deliver us, many a time, out of straits and distresses which we bring ourselves into, by our own sin and folly, we should be ruined. He deals not with us according to our deserts. Those are happy chastisements that hinder us in a sinful way, and bring us to our duty, particularly to the duty of restoring what we have wrongfully taken or kept. Pharaoh's reproof of Abram was very just: What is this that thou hast done? How unbecoming a wise and good man! If those who profess religion, do that which is unfair and deceptive, especially if they say that which borders upon a lie, they must expect to hear of it; and they have reason to thank those who will tell them of it. The sending away was kind. Pharaoh was so far from any design to kill Abram, as he feared, that he took particular care of him. We often perplex ourselves with fears which are altogether groundless. Many a time we fear where no fear is. Pharaoh charged his men not to hurt Abram in any thing. It is not enough for those in authority, that they do not hurt themselves; they must keep their servants and those about them from doing hurt.</body></html>
