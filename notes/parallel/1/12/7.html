The first mention of a theophany, though <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a> alleges that such a Divine manifestation had previously occurred in Ur of the Chaldees. Though not a direct vision of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>), that there was some kind of outward appearance may be inferred from the subsequent Divine manifestations to the patriarch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2, 17, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11-18</a>), to Hagar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17, 18</a>), and to Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-11.htm">Genesis 31:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>).

Now occupied by the Canaanites. Undoubtedly a great promise, that the Canaanites should be dispossessed, and their country given to the offspring of a childless old man already over seventy-five years. The apparent improbability of its ever being accomplished rendered it a strong trial to the patriarch's faith. <span class="cmt_word">And there builded he an altar.</span> "Constituit certum locum, in quo conveniat ecclesia, auditura verbum Dei, factura preess, laudatura Deum, sacrificatura <span class="accented">Dee"</span> (Luther). "Altare forma est Divini cultus; invocatio autem substantia et veritas" (Calvin). "The rearing of an altar in the land was, in fact, a form of taking possession of it on the ground of a right secured to the exercise of his faith" (Bush). "It is often said of Abraham and the patriarchs that they built altars to the Lord; it is never said they built houses for themselves" (Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Lord who had appeared to him.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:6-9 Abram found the country peopled by Canaanites, who were bad neighbours. He journeyed, going on still. Sometimes it is the lot of good men to be unsettled, and often to remove into various states. Believers must look on themselves as strangers and sojourners in this world, Heb 11:8,13,14. But observe how much comfort Abram had in God. When he could have little satisfaction in converse with the Canaanites whom he found there, he had abundance of pleasure in communion with that God, who brought him thither, and did not leave him. Communion with God is kept up by the word and by prayer. God reveals himself and his favours to his people by degrees; before, he had promised to show Abram this land, now, to give it to him: as grace is growing, so is comfort. It should seem, Abram understood it also as a grant of a better land, of which this was a type; for he looked for a heavenly country, Heb 11:16. As soon as Abram was got to Canaan, though he was but a stranger and sojourner there, yet he set up, and kept up, the worship of God in his family. He not only minded the ceremonial part of religion, the offering of sacrifice; but he made conscience of seeking his God, and calling on his name; that spiritual sacrifice with which God is well pleased. He preached concerning the name of the Lord; he taught his family and neighbours the knowledge of the true God, and his holy religion. The way of family worship is a good old way, no new thing, but the ancient usage of the saints. Abram was rich, and had a numerous family, was now unsettled, and in the midst of enemies; yet, wherever he pitched his tent, he built an altar: wherever we go, let us not fail to take our religion along with us.</body></html>
