The presents here show that Pharaoh fully believed that he was acting lawfully, while the largeness of them proves that Sarai, in spite of her years, was looked upon as a valuable acquisition. Among the presents are "asses." The charge on this account brought against the author of "inaccuracy," as if asses were not known at this time in Egypt, is disproved by the occurrence of representations of this animal on the tombs of Benihassan: we have proof even that they were numerous as far back as when the Pyramids of Gizeh were built. The horse is not mentioned, and the earliest representation of one is in the war-chariot of Ahmes, the first: Pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty, who expelled the Hyksos. Male and female slaves are, curiously enough, introduced between "he-asses" and "she-asses." As she-asses were especially valuable, perhaps these and the camels were looked upon as the monarch's choicest gifts.<p>Camels are not represented on the monuments, and are said not to thrive well in Egypt; but the Semitic hordes who were peopling the Delta would certainly bring camels with them. Many, too, of the Egyptian monarchs--as, for instance, those of the twelfth dynasty--held rule over a great part of the Sinaitic peninsula, and must have known the value of the camel for transporting heavy burdens in the desert, and its usefulness to a nomad sheik like Abram. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he entreated Abram well</span> - literally, <span class="accented">did good to Abram</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (LXX., Hieronymus, Poole) supposes that the court of Pharaoh or the Egyptian people generally conferred favors on the patriarch, which is not at all so probable as that Pharaoh did - <span class="cmt_word">for her sake.</span> Marriage negotiations in Oriental countries are usually accompanied by presents to the relatives of the de as a sort of payment.

Cf. with the Hebrew the Sanskrit as above, the Arab <span class="accented">jemel</span> or <span class="accented">gemel</span>, the Egyptian <span class="accented">sjamoul</span>, Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Latin <span class="accented">camelus</span>) is the well-known strong animal belonging to Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-67.htm">Ezra 2:67</a>), Arabia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>), Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>), Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>), which serves the inhabitants of the desert for travelling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-17.htm">Genesis 31:17</a>) as well as for carrying burdens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>), and for warlike operations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-7.htm">Genesis 21:7</a>), and in which their fiches consisted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>; 42:21). Though the camel does not thrive well in Egypt, and seldom appears on the monuments, the historian has not necessarily been guilty of an "<span class="accented">inaccuracy</span> and a blunder" in assigning it to Abram as one of Pharaoh's presents (Bohlen); for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the camel thrives better in Egypt than it does anywhere else out of its own proper habitat; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if camels were not generally kept in Egypt, this Pharaoh may have been "one of the shepherd kings who partly lived at Avaris, the Zoan of Scripture," a region much inhabited by strangers (Poole in Kitto, art. Camel); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> if camels have not been discovered among the delineations on the monuments, this may have been because of its connection with the foreign conqueror of Egypt, which caused it to be regarded as a beast of ill omen; though <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> according to Heeren they do appear on the monuments (Havernick, &sect; 18, p. 142). That horses, though the glory of Egypt, were not included among the monarch's gifts was doubtless owing to the fact that they could not have been of much service to the patriarch. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:10-20 There is no state on earth free from trials, nor any character free from blemishes. There was famine in Canaan, the glory of all lands, and unbelief, with the evils it ever brings, in Abram the father of the faithful. Perfect happiness and perfect purity dwell only in heaven. Abram, when he must for a time quit Canaan, goes to Egypt, that he might not seem to look back, and meaning to tarry there no longer than needful. There Abram dissembled his relation to Sarai, equivocated, and taught his wife and his attendants to do so too. He concealed a truth, so as in effect to deny it, and exposed thereby both his wife and the Egyptians to sin. The grace Abram was most noted for, was faith; yet he thus fell through unbelief and distrust of the Divine providence, even after God had appeared to him twice. Alas, what will become of weak faith, when strong faith is thus shaken! If God did not deliver us, many a time, out of straits and distresses which we bring ourselves into, by our own sin and folly, we should be ruined. He deals not with us according to our deserts. Those are happy chastisements that hinder us in a sinful way, and bring us to our duty, particularly to the duty of restoring what we have wrongfully taken or kept. Pharaoh's reproof of Abram was very just: What is this that thou hast done? How unbecoming a wise and good man! If those who profess religion, do that which is unfair and deceptive, especially if they say that which borders upon a lie, they must expect to hear of it; and they have reason to thank those who will tell them of it. The sending away was kind. Pharaoh was so far from any design to kill Abram, as he feared, that he took particular care of him. We often perplex ourselves with fears which are altogether groundless. Many a time we fear where no fear is. Pharaoh charged his men not to hurt Abram in any thing. It is not enough for those in authority, that they do not hurt themselves; they must keep their servants and those about them from doing hurt.</body></html>
