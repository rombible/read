As the name is thus taken from the natural conformation of the ground, it may be very ancient. The modern name of the place is Nablous, a contraction of Flavia Neapolis, a title given it in honour of Vespasian. Mr. Conder ( <span class= "ital">Tent Work in Palestine, </span>1:61) describes the valley as an oasis of remarkable beauty and luxuriance, but set, like Damascus, in a desert, and girt around by strong and barren mountains.<p><span class= "bld">The plain of Moreh.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the oak of Moreh, </span>It was here that Jacob buried the strange gods brought by his household from Haran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and here, too, Joshua set up the stone of testimony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm" title="And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.">Joshua 24:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm" title="And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.">Judges 9:6</a>); but as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm" title="Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?">Deuteronomy 11:30</a> the oaks (wrongly translated in most places in our version "plains") are described in the plural, it is probable that the word is to be taken as a collective for an oak grove. Such shady spots were favourite places for the tents of the wandering patriarchs. A famous terebinth, called after Abram's name, long existed at Mamre, and under it, in the time of Vespasian, the captive Jews were sold for slaves. It disappeared about A.D. 330, and no tree now marks the site of Abram's grove. The Hebrew word, however, for terebinth is <span class= "ital">elah, </span>while that used here is <span class= "ital">elon. </span>It was probably the <span class= "ital">quercus pseudococcifera </span>(see Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bible, </span>p. 369). This tree often grows to a vast size.<p><span class= "bld">Moreh.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">teacher </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-15.htm" title="The ancient and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet that teaches lies, he is the tail.">Isaiah 9:15</a>). Probably in this cool grove some religious personage had given instruction to the people. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-1.htm" title="Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.">Judges 7:1</a> we find a place called the "teacher's hill," and it is thus possible that among a people so religious as the race of Shem, men from time to time arose revered by the people as teachers of holiness. Such an one was Melchisedech.<p><span class= "bld">The Canaanite was then in the land.</span>--This is no sign of post-Mosaic authorship, nor a later interpolation, as if the meaning were that the Canaanite was there at that time, but is so no longer. What really is meant is that Abram on his arrival found the country no longer in the hands of the old Semitic stock, but occupied by the Canaanites, who seem to have gained the ascendancy, not so much by conquest as by gradual and peaceful means. We gather from the Egyptian records that this had taken place not very long before Abram's time. In the early inscriptions we read only of the Sati and Aamu, both apparently Semitic races, the latter name being derived from the Heb. <span class= "ital">am, </span>"people." Subsequently we find frequent mention of the Amaor and the Kheta--that is, the Amorites and Hittites, evidently in Abram's time the two most powerful races of Canaan. (See Tomkins' <span class= "ital">Studies, </span>82 ff.)

He journeyed, going on still. Sometimes it is the lot of good men to be unsettled, and often to remove into various states. Believers must look on themselves as strangers and sojourners in this world, Heb 11:8,13,14. But observe how much comfort Abram had in God. When he could have little satisfaction in converse with the Canaanites whom he found there, he had abundance of pleasure in communion with that God, who brought him thither, and did not leave him. Communion with God is kept up by the word and by prayer. God reveals himself and his favours to his people by degrees; before, he had promised to show Abram this land, now, to give it to him: as grace is growing, so is comfort. It should seem, Abram understood it also as a grant of a better land, of which this was a type; for he looked for a heavenly country, Heb 11:16. As soon as Abram was got to Canaan, though he was but a stranger and sojourner there, yet he set up, and kept up, the worship of God in his family. He not only minded the ceremonial part of religion, the offering of sacrifice; but he made conscience of seeking his God, and calling on his name; that spiritual sacrifice with which God is well pleased. He preached concerning the name of the Lord; he taught his family and neighbours the knowledge of the true God, and his holy religion. The way of family worship is a good old way, no new thing, but the ancient usage of the saints. Abram was rich, and had a numerous family, was now unsettled, and in the midst of enemies; yet, wherever he pitched his tent, he built an altar: wherever we go, let us not fail to take our religion along with us.</body></html>
