an expression which Joseph never could have used, since the Hebrews were strangers and sojourners in the land, and had no settled possession in it, and therefore a certain index of the lateness of the composition of this portion of the narrative (Block, 'Introd.,' &sect; 80); but if Abram, nearly two centuries earlier, was recognized as a Hebrew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>), and if Potiphar's wife could, in speaking to her Egyptian husband and domestics, describe Joseph as an Hebrew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14, 17</a>), there does not appear sufficient reason why Joseph should not be able to characterize his country as the land of the Hebrews. The Hebrews had through Abraham become known at least to Pharaoh and his Court as belonging to the land of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-15.htm">Genesis 12:15-20</a>); and it is not a violent supposition that in Joseph s time "<span class="accented">the</span> land of the Hebrews" was a phrase quite intelligible to an Egyptian, as signifying not perhaps the entire extent of Palestine, but the region round about Hebron and Mamre (Nachmanides, Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller) - scarcely as suggesting that the Hebrews had possession of the land prior to the Canaanites (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And here also have I done nothing</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> committed no crime) <span class="cmt_word">that they should</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that they have</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>put me into the dungeon</span>. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> is here used to describe Joseph's place of confinement, because pits or cisterns or cesspools, when empty, were frequently employed in primitive times for the incarceration of offenders (el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-19 It was not so much the prison that made the butler and baker sad, as their dreams. God has more ways than one to sadden the spirits. Joseph had compassion towards them. Let us be concerned for the sadness of our brethren's countenances. It is often a relief to those that are in trouble to be noticed. Also learn to look into the causes of our own sorrow. Is there a good reason? Is there not comfort sufficient to balance it, whatever it is? Why art thou cast down, O my soul? Joseph was careful to ascribe the glory to God. The chief butler's dream foretold his advancement. The chief baker's dream his death. It was not Joseph's fault that he brought the baker no better tidings. And thus ministers are but interpreters; they cannot make the thing otherwise than it is: if they deal faithfully, and their message prove unpleasing, it is not their fault. Joseph does not reflect upon his brethren that sold him; nor does he reflect on the wrong done him by his mistress and his master, but mildly states his own innocence. When we are called on to clear ourselves, we should carefully avoid, as much as may be, speaking ill of others. Let us be content to prove ourselves innocent, and not upbraid others with their guilt.</body></html>
