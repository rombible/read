As we learn in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-11.htm" title="And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.">Genesis 40:11</a> that it was grapewine which he gave the king to drink, this chapter has been the main dependence of the new critics for their proof that the Book of Genesis was not written by Moses. For Herod. (i. 77) says, "The Egyptians make use of wine prepared from barley, because there are no vineyards in their country." As Herodotus was thirteen centuries later than the time of Joseph, they argue not only that the vine could not have been introduced into Egypt at so early a date, but that the records of Joseph's life could not have been put together by anyone acquainted with Egypt, in spite of their exact knowledge in all other respects of Egyptian customs. But when we turn to Herodotus himself, we find the most complete refutation of the previous statement. For, in Book ii. 37, speaking of the liberal treatment of the priests, he says, that they had an allowance of "grape-wine." Again, in Genesis 39, he tells us that it was the custom to pour wine on a victim about to be sacrificed. To one used to the extensive vineyards of Greece and Asia Minor, the comparative scarcity of the vine, and the use of another ordinary drink in its place, would be striking; but that he was guilty of gross exaggeration in his statement is proved by evidence far more trustworthy than his own writings. For, on the tombs at Beni-hassan, which are anterior to the time of Joseph, on those at Thebes, and on the Pyramids, are representations of vines grown in every way, except that usual in Italy, festooned on trees; there is every process of the vintage, grapes in baskets, men trampling them in vats, various forms of presses for squeezing out the juice, jars for storing it, and various processes, even of the fermentation, noticed. Numerous engravings of the sculptures and paintings on these ancient monuments may be seen in Wilkinson's <span class= "ital">Egypt; </span>and most abundant evidence of the culture of the vine in ancient Egypt has been collected, and an account of the vines grown there given in Malan's <span class= "ital">Philosophy or Truth, </span>pp. 31-39. It neither is nor ever was a great wine-producing country, but the vine existed from one end of the country to the other, as it does at this day.<p><span class= "bld">Baker.</span>--Wilkinson, <span class= "ital">Ancient Egyptians, </span>ii. 38, 39, gives proof from the monuments, that they had carried the art of making confectionery to very great perfection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and it was</span>) <span class="cmt_word">after these things</span> (literally, <span class="accented">words</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the transactions just re. corded), <span class="cmt_word">that the butler</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, the hiph. part. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to drink, signifies one who causes to drink, hence cupbearer (cf. ver. 11) - <span class="cmt_word">of the king of Egypt and his baker</span> - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (part. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to cook or bake) was the officer who prepared the king's food. The monuments show that the Egyptians had carried the arts of the confectioner and cook to a high degree of perfection (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hengstenberg, 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 27; Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' 2:33-39, ed. 1878) - <span class="cmt_word">had offended</span> (or sinned against) <span class="cmt_word">their lord</span> (literally, <span class="accented">against</span>, the preposition being repeated) <span class="cmt_word">the king of Egypt</span> - whom they had attempted to poison (the Targum of Jonathan), though this of course is only a conjecture in the absence of specific information. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-19 It was not so much the prison that made the butler and baker sad, as their dreams. God has more ways than one to sadden the spirits. Joseph had compassion towards them. Let us be concerned for the sadness of our brethren's countenances. It is often a relief to those that are in trouble to be noticed. Also learn to look into the causes of our own sorrow. Is there a good reason? Is there not comfort sufficient to balance it, whatever it is? Why art thou cast down, O my soul? Joseph was careful to ascribe the glory to God. The chief butler's dream foretold his advancement. The chief baker's dream his death. It was not Joseph's fault that he brought the baker no better tidings. And thus ministers are but interpreters; they cannot make the thing otherwise than it is: if they deal faithfully, and their message prove unpleasing, it is not their fault. Joseph does not reflect upon his brethren that sold him; nor does he reflect on the wrong done him by his mistress and his master, but mildly states his own innocence. When we are called on to clear ourselves, we should carefully avoid, as much as may be, speaking ill of others. Let us be content to prove ourselves innocent, and not upbraid others with their guilt.</body></html>
