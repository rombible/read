The introduction of the vine into the narrative, which has been pronounced (Bohlen) an important factor in proof of its recent composition, since, according to Herodotus (2:77), the vine was not cultivated in Egypt, and, according to Plutarch ('De Is. et Osir.,' 6), it was not till after Psammetichus, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about the time of Josiah, that the Egyptians began to drink wine, has now by more accurate study been ascertained to be in exact accordance, not only with Biblical statements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-5.htm">Numbers 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-33.htm">Psalm 105:33</a>), but likewise with the testimony of Herodotus, who affirms (2:37) that wine (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) was a privilege of the priestly order, and with the representations on the monuments of vines and grapes, and of the entire process of wine-making (<span class="accented">vide</span> Havernick's 'Introduction,' &sect; 21; Wilkinson's 'Ancient Egyptians,' 1:379, <span class="accented">et seqq</span>. 430, 431, ed. 1878; Hengstenberg, 'Egypt,' p. 13; Rawlinson, 'Hist.

That Pharaoh is represented as drinking the expressed juice of grapes is no proof that the Egyptians were not acquainted with fermentation, and did not drink fermented liquors. In numerous frescoes the process of fermentation is distinctly represented, and Herodotus testifies that though the use of grape wine was comparatively limited, the common people drank a wine made from barley: <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> (2:77) - i<span class="cmt_word">nto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand</span> - literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">placed the cup upon Pharaoh's palm</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, used of Jacob's thigh-socket (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>), meaning something hollowed out. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-19 It was not so much the prison that made the butler and baker sad, as their dreams. God has more ways than one to sadden the spirits. Joseph had compassion towards them. Let us be concerned for the sadness of our brethren's countenances. It is often a relief to those that are in trouble to be noticed. Also learn to look into the causes of our own sorrow. Is there a good reason? Is there not comfort sufficient to balance it, whatever it is? Why art thou cast down, O my soul? Joseph was careful to ascribe the glory to God. The chief butler's dream foretold his advancement. The chief baker's dream his death. It was not Joseph's fault that he brought the baker no better tidings. And thus ministers are but interpreters; they cannot make the thing otherwise than it is: if they deal faithfully, and their message prove unpleasing, it is not their fault. Joseph does not reflect upon his brethren that sold him; nor does he reflect on the wrong done him by his mistress and his master, but mildly states his own innocence. When we are called on to clear ourselves, we should carefully avoid, as much as may be, speaking ill of others. Let us be content to prove ourselves innocent, and not upbraid others with their guilt.</body></html>
