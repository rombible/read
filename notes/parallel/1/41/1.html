Just as centuries afterwards, Daniel rose to high office at Babylon by God making known to him the dream of Nebuchadnezzar; so here, the transplantation of Israel into Egypt is brought about by the revelation to Joseph of "what was to be hereafter."<p>The river.--Heb., <span class= "ital">Yeor, </span>the Egyptian word for "great river."

But Canon Cook, in his Essay, <span class= "ital">On the bearings of Egyptian History upon the Pentateuch, </span>after carefully reviewing the whole subject, decides in favour of King Amenemha III., the greatest monarch of the noble twelfth dynasty, and the last king of all Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass at the end of two full years</span> (literally, <span class="accented">two years of</span> days, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two complete years from the commencement of Joseph's incarceration, or more probably after the butler's liberation), <span class="cmt_word">that Pharaoh</span> - on the import of the term <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 12:15.

It may assist the student to arrive at a decision with respect to these contending aspirants for the throne of Pharaoh in the time of Joseph to know that Canon Cook ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 451), after an elaborate and careful as well as scholarly review of the entire question, regards it as at least "a very probable conjecture" that the Pharaoh of Joseph was Amenemha III., "who is represented on the lately-discovered table of Abydos as the last great king of all Egypt in the ancient empire (the last of the twelfth dynasty), and as such receiving divine honors from his descendant Rameses" - <span class="cmt_word">dreamed</span>. "For the third time are dreams employed as the agencies of Joseph's history: they first foreshadow his illustrious future; they then manifest that the Spirit of God had not abandoned him even in the abject condition of a slave and a prisoner; and lastly they are made the immediate forerunners of his greatness" (Kalisch.). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, he stood by the river</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> upon the banks of the Nile, the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;</span> (an Egyptian word signifying great river or canal, in the Memphitic dialect <span class="accented">yaro, in</span> the Sahidic <span class="accented">yero</span>) being used almost exclusively in Scripture for the Nile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>; Gesenius, 'Lex., p. 326).

Now that God no longer speaks to us in that way, it is no matter how little we either heed dreams, or tell them. The telling of foolish dreams can make no better than foolish talk. But these dreams showed that they were sent of God; when he awoke, Pharaoh's spirit was troubled.</body></html>
