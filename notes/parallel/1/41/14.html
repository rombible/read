whereas in Palestine the beard was regarded as a manly ornament. On Egyptian monuments only captives and men of low condition are represented with beards. In the prison, therefore, Joseph would leave his beard untrimmed, but when summoned into the king's presence, he would shave it off. Abravanel notices that for each suffering of Joseph there was an exact recompense. It was for dreams that his brethren hated him, and by help of dreams he was exalted in Egypt. They stripped him of his many-coloured coat; the Egyptians clothed him in byssus. They cast him into a pit, and from the pit <span class= "ital">of </span>the prison he was drawn forth by Pharaoh. They sold him into slavery; in Egypt he was made lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily</span> (literally, <span class="accented">caused him to run</span>) <span class="cmt_word">out of the dungeon</span> (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-15.htm">Genesis 40:15</a>): <span class="cmt_word">and he shaved himself</span>, - this was exactly in accordance with Egyptian custom (Herod. 2:36). Wilkinson states that "the custom of shaving the head as well as beard was not confined to the priests in Egypt, but was general among all classes" (Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 49; cf. 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 2. pp. 330-332. ed. 1878). That the verb is not more exactly defined by a terra Cellowing, such as the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-9.htm">Numbers 6:9</a>), the beard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>), but stands alone (the only instance of its intransitive use), appears to suggest that the writer was familiar with the practice of shaving (<span class="accented">vide</span> Havernick, 'Introd.,'&sect; 21) - <span class="cmt_word">and changed his raiment</span>, - as required by the customs of Egypt (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hengstenberg's 'Egypt,' p. 30; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and came</span> (or went) <span class="cmt_word">in unto Pharaoh.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:9-32 God's time for the enlargement of his people is the fittest time. If the chief butler had got Joseph to be released from prison, it is probable he would have gone back to the land of the Hebrews. Then he had neither been so blessed himself, nor such a blessing to his family, as afterwards he proved. Joseph, when introduced to Pharaoh, gives honour to God. Pharaoh had dreamed that he stood upon the bank of the river Nile, and saw the kine, both the fat ones, and the lean ones, come out of the river. Egypt has no rain, but the plenty of the year depends upon the overflowing of the river Nile. See how many ways Providence has of dispensing its gifts; yet our dependence is still the same upon the First Cause, who makes every creature what it is to us, be it rain or river. See to what changes the comforts of this life are subject. We cannot be sure that to-morrow shall be as this day, or next year as this. We must learn how to want, as well as how to abound. Mark the goodness of God in sending the seven years of plenty before those of famine, that provision might be made. The produce of the earth is sometimes more, and sometimes less; yet, take one with another, he that gathers much, has nothing over; and he that gathers little, has no lack, Ex 16:18. And see the perishing nature of our worldly enjoyments. The great harvests of the years of plenty were quite lost, and swallowed up in the years of famine; and that which seemed very much, yet did but just serve to keep the people alive. There is bread which lasts to eternal life, which it is worth while to labour for. They that make the things of this world their good things, will find little pleasure in remembering that they have received them.</body></html>
