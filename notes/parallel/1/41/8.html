But in ancient times the possession of real knowledge was generally accompanied by a claim to an occult and mysterious acquaintance with the secrets of the gods and of nature. And as the people regarded the knowledge which such scribes really possessed as more than human, the claim was easily maintained, or, rather, grew naturally out of the superstition of the multitude. So, too, the "wise men" were men educated and trained, but probably the profession of magic, of divination, and astrology was that which gained for them wealth and honour, and not the possession of whatever real science existed at that time in Egypt. We find, subsequently, even Joseph claiming the power of divination.<p><span class= "bld">There was none that could interpret . . . --</span>Probably many of the wise men made the attempt, but in such an imperfect manner as not to be able to satisfy Pharaoh's mind, or allay the excitement of his spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;</span> or, rather, his mind was agitated, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">pavore perterritus</span> (Vulgate), the <span class="accented">ruach</span> being the seat of the senses, affections, and emotions of various kinds (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-5.htm">Daniel 4:5, 19</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and he</span> <span class="cmt_word">sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt</span>, - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> (unused), to engrave, whence <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, a stylus (Gesenius), or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to see or explain, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, to conceal, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he who explains hidden or mysterious things (Kalisch), were sacred scribes, <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, belonging to the priestly caste, who were skilled in making and deciphering the hieroglyphics.

That they could not explain the dream, though couched in the symbolical language of the time, was no doubt surprising; but "the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>), and they to whom the Spirit doth reveal them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-8 The means of Joseph's being freed from prison were Pharaoh's dreams, as here related. Now that God no longer speaks to us in that way, it is no matter how little we either heed dreams, or tell them. The telling of foolish dreams can make no better than foolish talk. But these dreams showed that they were sent of God; when he awoke, Pharaoh's spirit was troubled.</body></html>
