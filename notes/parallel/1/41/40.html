The ordinary meaning of the verb is <span class= "ital">to kiss, </span>and the translation would then be <span class= "ital">And on thy mouth shall all my people kiss, </span>that is, they shall do thee homage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm" title="Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.

The versions seem to have taken this sense, though they translate very loosely "shall obey thee;" or <span class= "ital">"</span>shall receive judgment at thy mouth;" or "shall be governed by thee." As however in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.">1Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-17.htm" title="And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.">2Chronicles 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-9.htm" title="The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.">Psalm 78:9</a>, the verb is used of bearing arms, Aben-Ezra translates "shall arm themselves," and supposes that Joseph was made commander-in-chief.

Fair warning should always be followed by good counsel. God has in his word told us of a day of trial before us, when we shall need all the grace we can have. Now, therefore, provide accordingly. Pharaoh gave Joseph an honourable testimony. He is a man in whom the spirit of God is; and such men ought to be valued. Pharaoh puts upon Joseph marks of honour. He gave him such a name as spoke the value he had for him, Zaphnath-paaneah, a revealer of secrets. This preferment of Joseph encourages all to trust in God. Some translate Joseph's new name, the saviour of the world. The brightest glories, even of the upper world, are put upon Christ, the highest trust lodged in his hand, and all power given him, both in heaven and earth.</body></html>
