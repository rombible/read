It is situated about six miles north-east of Cairo.<p>A difficulty has been felt by some in a Hebrew shepherd being thus described as marrying the daughter of a priest of the sun; and also that Joseph, a worshipper of the One God, should ally himself with an idolater. But the elevation of a slave to high rank is not an uncommon occurrence in the East, especially as he might be of as good birth and education as his owner, slaves being obtained either by kidnapping, or by war. And a slave so raised to power, would not be likely to oppose his benefactor, nor would even a high priest refuse a daughter to the king's favourite, especially if, as appears to have been the case, he had first been raised to the priesthood. Joseph too, would rightly regard the whole matter as providential, and though he might not know for what exact purpose, as regards his race, he was thus exalted, there was noble work for him to do in saving Egypt from perishing by famine. The narrative throughout represents him as remaining true to the religion of his family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/41-51.htm" title="And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.">Genesis 41:51-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-18.htm" title="And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:">Genesis 42:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.">Genesis 43:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-5.htm" title="Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life.">Genesis 45:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/45-7.htm" title="And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.">Genesis 45:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-9.htm" title="And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.">Genesis 48:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-19.htm" title="And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.">Genesis 1:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>), but probably, on public occasions he would be required to attend at the religious solemnities of the Egyptian gods. We must remember, however, that their worship had not degenerated as yet into the miserable idolatry of later times, and that the Egyptian creed contained much primaeval truth, though in a corrupted form. Pharaoh himself, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/41-38.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?">Genesis 41:38-39</a>, speaks as one that acknowledged a supreme God, and Joseph throughout freely used to him the name of Elohim. As for Asenath, no doubt Joseph would teach her higher views of the Deity, and make her acquainted with the religious hopes and destinies of the Abrahamic race.<p>The possibility, however, of a foreigner attaining to high rank in Egypt, is demonstrated by the story of Saneha, translated in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. vi., pp. 131-150. It belongs to the reign of Amenemha I., a king of the twelfth dynasty, and represents Saneha as entering Egypt in the dress of a herbseller, but in time he marries there the eldest daughter of a local king, has a large landed estate given him, "which abounded in wines more than in water," and, finally, is sent for by King Amenemha, and raised to such high rank, as to be clad in "garments of kingly attire," and on his going to the royal palace "the king's children attend him, proceeding even unto the great gates." This curious evidence, which is even a little older than the time of Joseph, proves that there is nothing unusual or improbable in his exaltation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah</span>; - an Egyptian word, of which the most accredited interpretations are <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;</span> (LXX); <span class="accented">Salva-tor Mundi</span> (Vulgate); "the Salvation of the World," answering to the Coptic P-sote-m-ph-eneh - P the article, <span class="accented">sots</span> salvation, m the sign of the genitive, <span class="accented">ph</span> the article, and <span class="accented">eneh</span> the world (Furst, Jablonsky, Rosellini, and others); "the Rescuer of the World" (Gesenius); "the Prince of the Life of the World" (Brugsch); "the Food of Life," or "the Food of the Living" (Canon Cook in 'Speaker's Commentary') - <span class="cmt_word">and he gave him to wife</span> - cf. the act of Rhamp-sinitus, who gave his daughter in marriage to the son of an architect on account of his cleverness (Herod., 2:121) - <span class="cmt_word">Asenath</span> - another Egyptian term, rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;</span> (LXX.), and explained by Egyptologers to mean, "She who is of Neith, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Minerva of the Egyptians" (Gesenius, Furst), "the Worshipper of Neith" (Jablousky), "the Favorite of Neith" (Canon Cook in 'Speaker's Commentary'), though by some authorities regarded as Hebrew (Pools in Smith's ' Dictionary,' art. Joseph) - <span class="cmt_word">the daughter of Potipherah</span> - Potipherah ("devoted to the sun") - Potiphar (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>). The name is very common on Egyptian monuments (Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 32) - <span class="cmt_word">priest</span> - or prince (Onkelos.), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, where the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, as explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>, means a principal minister of State, though the probability is that Poti-pherah belonged to the priestly caste in Egypt - <span class="cmt_word">of On</span> - or Heliopolis, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), the name on the monuments being ta-Ra or pa-Ra, house of the sun. "The site of Heliopolis is still marked by the massive walls that surround it, and by a granite obelisk bearing the name of Osirtasen I., of the twelfth dynasty, dating about 3900 years ago" (Wilkinson in Rawlinson's 'Herod.,' 2. p. 8). The priests attached to the temple of the sun at Heliopolis enjoyed the reputation of being the most intelligent and cultured historians in Egypt (Herod., 2:3). That a priest's daughter should have married with a foreign shepherd may, have been distasteful to the prejudices of an intolerant priesthood (Bohlen), but in the case of Asenath and Joseph it was recommended by sundry powerful considerations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, Joseph was a descendant of Abraham, whom a former Pharaoh had recognized and honored as a prince, and ' The Story of Saneha,' a hieratic papyrus belonging to the twelfth dynasty, shows that Eastern foreigners might even become sons-in-law to the most powerful potentates under the ancient empire (vide 'Records of the Past,' vol. 6. pp. 135-150). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, Joseph was at this time grand vizier of the realm, with absolute control of the lives and fortunes of its people (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 44). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, he was obviously a favorite of Pharaoh, who, besides being monarch of the realm, was the recognized head of the priestly caste, over whom, therefore, he exercised more than a merely external authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Though a foreign shepherd Joseph had become a naturalized Egyptian, as may be gathered from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-32.htm">Genesis 43:32</a>. And, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Though a foreign shepherd, he was circumcised, which, if this rite was already observed in Egypt, and did not originate with Joseph, would certainly not prove a bar to the contemplated alliance (<span class="accented">vide</span> Canon Cook in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 480; Kurst, 'Hist. of Old Covenant,' &sect; 88; Hengstenberg, 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' pp. 32-35). As to the probability of Joseph consenting to become son-in-law to a heathen priest, it may suffice to remember that though marriage with idolaters was expressly forbidden by patriarchal commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1</a>), and afterwards by Mosaic statute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-16.htm">Genesis 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), it was sometimes contracted for what seemed a perfectly adequate reason, viz., the furtherance of the Divine purposes concerning Israel, and apparently too with the Divine sanction (cf. the cases of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>, and Esther, Esther 2:16); that Joseph may have deemed the religion of Egypt, especially in its early symbolical forms, as perfectly compatible with a pure monotheistic worship, or, if he judged it idolatrous, he may both have secured for himself complete toleration and have felt himself strong enough to resist its seductions; that Asenath may have adopted her husband's faith, though on this, of course, nothing can be affirmed; and lastly, that the narrator of this history pronounces no judgment on the moral quality of Joseph's conduct in consenting to this alliance, which, though overruled for good, may have been, considered in itself, a sin. <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt</span> in the discharge of his vice-regal duties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 41:46-57 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:33-45 Joseph gave good advice to Pharaoh. Fair warning should always be followed by good counsel. God has in his word told us of a day of trial before us, when we shall need all the grace we can have. Now, therefore, provide accordingly. Pharaoh gave Joseph an honourable testimony. He is a man in whom the spirit of God is; and such men ought to be valued. Pharaoh puts upon Joseph marks of honour. He gave him such a name as spoke the value he had for him, Zaphnath-paaneah, a revealer of secrets. This preferment of Joseph encourages all to trust in God. Some translate Joseph's new name, the saviour of the world. The brightest glories, even of the upper world, are put upon Christ, the highest trust lodged in his hand, and all power given him, both in heaven and earth.</body></html>
