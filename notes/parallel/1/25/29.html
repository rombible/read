Coming home one day weary, and fainting with hunger, he found Jacob preparing a pottage of lentils. No sooner did the savoury smell reach him than he cried out in haste, "Let me swallow, I pray, of the red, this red." The verb expresses extreme eagerness, and he adds no noun whatever, but points to the steaming dish. And Jacob, seeing his brother's greediness and ravenous hunger, refuses to give him food until he has parted with the high and sacred prerogative which made him the inheritor of the Divine promise.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore was his name called Edom.</span>--Esau may have been called Edom, that is, <span class= "ital">Rufus, </span>the red one, before, but after this act it ceased to be a mere allusive by name, and became his ordinary appellation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob sod pottage</span>: - literally, <span class="accented">cooked something cooked</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3b2;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.); prepared boiled food, of lentils (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 34) - <span class="cmt_word">and Esau came from the field, and he was faint</span> - exhausted, the term being used of one who is both wearied and languishing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-7.htm">Job 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:29-34 We have here the bargain made between Jacob and Esau about the right, which was Esau's by birth, but Jacob's by promise. It was for a spiritual privilege; and we see Jacob's desire of the birth-right, but he sought to obtain it by crooked courses, not like his character as a plain man. He was right, that he coveted earnestly the best gifts; he was wrong, that he took advantage of his brother's need. The inheritance of their father's worldly goods did not descend to Jacob, and was not meant in this proposal. But it includeth the future possession of the land of Canaan by his children's children, and the covenant made with Abraham as to Christ the promised Seed. Believing Jacob valued these above all things; unbelieving Esau despised them. Yet although we must be of Jacob's judgment in seeking the birth-right, we ought carefully to avoid all guile, in seeking to obtain even the greatest advantages. Jacob's pottage pleased Esau's eye. Give me some of that red; for this he was called Edom, or Red. Gratifying the sensual appetite ruins thousands of precious souls. When men's hearts walk after their own eyes, Job 31:7, and when they serve their own bellies, they are sure to be punished. If we use ourselves to deny ourselves, we break the force of most temptations. It cannot be supposed that Esau was dying of hunger in Isaac's house. The words signify, I am going towards death; he seems to mean, I shall never live to inherit Canaan, or any of those future supposed blessings; and what signifies it who has them when I am dead and gone. This would be the language of profaneness, with which the apostle brands him, Heb 12:16; and this contempt of the birth-right is blamed, ver. 34. It is the greatest folly to part with our interest in God, and Christ, and heaven, for the riches, honours, and pleasures of this world; it is as bad a bargain as his who sold a birth-right for a dish of pottage. Esau ate and drank, pleased his palate, satisfied his appetite, and then carelessly rose up and went his way, without any serious thought, or any regret, about the bad bargain he had made. Thus Esau despised his birth-right. By his neglect and contempt afterwards, and by justifying himself in what he had done, he put the bargain past recall. People are ruined, not so much by doing what is amiss, as by doing it and not repenting of it.</body></html>
