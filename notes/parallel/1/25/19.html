(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22-23</a>.) The name of the district also correctly is "Paddan-Ararn," and so far from being identical with Aram-Naharaim, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>, it is strictly the designation of the region immediately in the neighbourhood of Charran. The assertion of Gesenius that it meant "Mesopotamia, with the desert to the west of the Euphrates, in opposition to the mountainous district towards the Mediterranean," is devoid of proof. (See Chwolsohn, <span class= "ital">Die Ssabier, </span>1, p. 304.) In Syriac, the language of Charran, padana means a <span class= "ital">plough </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-20.htm" title="But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his ax, and his mattock.">1Samuel 13:20</a>), or a <span class= "ital">yoke of oxen </span>( <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-7.htm" title="And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.">1Samuel 11:7</a>); and this also suggests that it was the cultivated district close to the town. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm" title="And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.">Hosea 12:12</a> it is said that "Jacob fled to the field of Aram;" but this is a very general description of the country in which he found refuge, and affords no basis for the assertion that Padan-aram was the level region. Finally, the assertion that it is an ancient name used by the Jehovist is an assertion only. It is the name of a special district, and the knowledge of it was the result of Jacob's long-continued stay there. Chwolsohn says that traces of the name still remain in Faddan and Tel Faddan, two places close to Charran, mentioned by Yacut, the Arabian geographer, who flourished in the thirteenth century.<p><span class= "bld">Isaac intreated the Lord.</span>--This barrenness lasted twenty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm" title="And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them.">Genesis 25:26</a>), and must have greatly troubled Isaac; but it would also compel him to dwell much in thought upon the purpose for which he had been given to Abraham, and afterwards rescued from death upon the mount Jehovah-Jireh. And when offspring came, in answer to his earnest pleading of the promise, the delay would serve to impress upon both parents the religious significance of their existence as a separate race and family, and the necessity of training their children worthily. The derivation of the verb <span class= "ital">to intreat, </span>from a noun signifying <span class= "ital">incense, </span>is uncertain, but rendered probable by the natural connection of the idea of the ascending fragrance, and that of the prayer mounting heavenward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-4.htm" title="And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.">Revelation 8:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The children struggled together.--</span>Two dissimilar nations sprang from Abraham, but from mothers totally unlike; so, too, from the peaceful Isaac two distinct races of men were to take their origin, but from the same mother, and the contest began while they were yet unborn. And Rebekah, apparently unaware that she was pregnant with twins, but harassed with the pain of strange jostlings and thrusts, grew despondent, and exclaimed--<p><span class= "bld">If it be so, why am I thus?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">If </span>so, <span class= "ital">why am I this? </span>Some explain this as meaning "Why do I still live?" but more probably she meant, If I have thus conceived, in answer to my husband's prayers, why do I suffer in this strange manner? It thus prepares for what follows, namely, that Rebekah wished to have her condition explained to her, and therefore went to inquire of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">She went to enquire of the Lord.</span>--Not to Shem, nor Melchizedek, as many think, nor even to Abraham, who was still alive, but, as Theodoret suggests, to the family altar. Isaac had several homes, but probably the altar at Bethel, erected when Abraham first took possession of the Promised Land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a>), and therefore especially holy, was the place signified; and if Abraham were there, he would doubtless join his prayers to those of Rebekah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son</span>. The usual formula for the opening of a new section (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abraham begat Isaac</span>. A reiteration in perfect harmony not only with the style of the present narrative, but of ancient historiography in general; in this instance specially designed to connect the subsequent streams of Isaac's posterity with their original fountain-head in Abraham. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:19-26 Isaac seems not to have been much tried, but to have spent his days in quietness. Jacob and Esau were prayed for; their parents, after being long childless, obtained them by prayer. The fulfilment of God's promise is always sure, yet it is often slow. The faith of believers is tried, their patience exercised, and mercies long waited for are more welcome when they come. Isaac and Rebekah kept in view the promise of all nations being blessed in their posterity, therefore were not only desirous of children, but anxious concerning every thing which seemed to mark their future character. In all our doubts we should inquire of the Lord by prayer. In many of our conflicts with sin and temptation, we may adopt Rebekah's words, If it be so, why am I thus? If a child of God, why so careless or carnal? If not a child of God, why so afraid of, or so burdened with sin?</body></html>
