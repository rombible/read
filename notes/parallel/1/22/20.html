But besides the domestic interest, the knowledge thus conveyed to him was the cause "probably of Abraham's determination to seek a wife for his son from among his own kindred. It has been noticed that Nahor has twelve sons, eight by his lawful wife, and four by his concubine. So Jacob has twelve sons, eight by two lawful wives, and four by two concubines. Lastly, Ishmael has twelve sons. These coincidences are curious, but afford no ground for the assertion that therefore these narratives are mythical. For coincidences quite as strange are to be found in every history, and in daily life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass after these things</span> (probably not long after his return to Beersheba), <span class="cmt_word">that it was told</span> (by some unknown messenger or accidental traveler from Mesopotamia) <span class="cmt_word">Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>), <span class="cmt_word">she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor</span> - as Sarah has born a son to thee.

This seems to be given for the connexion which it had with the church of God. From thence Isaac and Jacob took wives; and before the account of those events this list is recorded. It shows that though Abraham saw his own family highly honoured with privileges, admitted into covenant, and blessed with the assurance of the promise, yet he did not look with disdain upon his relations, but was glad to hear of the increase and welfare of their families.</body></html>
