It thus makes the words more an exhortation than a command.<p><span class= "bld">Thine only son Isaac.</span>--The words in the original are more emphatic, being, "Take, I pray, thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac." If childlessness was so unendurable in old time to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>), what would it be now, after so many years of enjoyment of a son, and after giving up Ishmael for his sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-18.htm" title="And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before you!">Genesis 17:18</a>)?<p><span class= "bld">The land of Moriah.</span>--Moriah may either mean <span class= "ital">Jah is teacher </span>(see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh.

If this be the meaning, the name would be derived from this event, and would signify the place where "Jehovah will Himself provide the sacrifice." It has been suggested by many able commentators, that the place meant was Moreh in Sichem, and that the site of the sacrifice was, as the Samaritans affirmed, the natural altar upon the summit of Mount Gerizim. But as Abraham and Isaac reached the spot on the third day, and evidently at an early hour, Gerizim is too remote from Beer-sheba for this to be possible Even Jerusalem is distant enough, as the journey from Beer-sheba takes twenty and a half hours; and travellers in those days had to cook their own food, and prepare their own sleeping accommodation. We may notice also, that Moriah is described as "a land," in some part of which Abraham was to be shown the special mountain intended for the sacrifice; Moreh, on the contrary, was a place where Abraham had lived, and which was therefore well known to him.<p><span class= "bld">Offer him there for a burnt offering.</span>--Hengstenberg and others have argued that Abraham was not to kill Isaac, but to surrender him spiritually to God, and sanctify him by a burnt offering. But this is contradicted by the narrative itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-10.htm" title="And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.">Genesis 22:10</a>), and by the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews referred to above, where the victory of Abraham's faith is described as consisting in the belief, that even though Isaac were killed, nevertheless the promise would still in some Divine manner be fulfilled in him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Take</span> now - "the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span> modifies the command, and seems to express that Elohim wished to receive the sacrifice as a free-will offering" (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">thy son</span> (not a lamb, but thy child), <span class="cmt_word">thine only son</span> - not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), but <span class="accented">unigenitum</span> (Vulgate), meaning the only son of Sarah, the only legitimate offspring he possessed, the only heir of the promise, the only child that remained to him after Ishmael's departure (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Isaac, whom thou lovest,</span> - or, <span class="accented">whom thou lovest, Isaac</span>; the order and accumulation of the terms being calculated to excite the parental affection of the patriarch to the highest pitch, and to render compliance with the Divine demand a trial of the utmost severity - <span class="cmt_word">and get thee</span> - literally, <span class="accented">go for thyself</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">into the land of Moriah</span>. Moriah - vision (Vulgate, Symmachus, Samaritan), worship (Onkelos, Jonathan), high (LXX.), rebellious (Murphy); but rather a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, meaning God is my instructor, alluding to the temple from which the law should afterwards proceed (Kalisch), or, better, of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>, and signifying "the shown of Jehovah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the revelation or manifestation of Jehovah (Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Keil, &e.); or "the chosen, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pointed out of God," with reference to its selection as the site of the Divine sanctuary (Gesenius), or rather because there God provided and pointed out the sacrifice which he elected to accept (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">And offer him there for a burnt offering</span> - not make a spiritual surrender of him in and through a burnt offering (Hengstenberg, Lange), but actually present him as a holocaust. That Abraham did not stagger on receiving this astounding injunction may be accounted for by remembering that the practice of offering human sacrifices prevailed among the early Chaldaeans and Canaanites, and that as yet no formal prohibition, like that of the Mosaic code, had been issued against them - <span class="cmt_word">upon one of the mountains</span> - not Moreh in Sicbem (Tuch, Michaelis, Stanley, Grove, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), which was too distant, but Moriah at Jerusalem (Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Keil, Kalisch), where subsequently God appeared to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>), and the temple of Solomon was built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">which I will tell thee of</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> point out (probably by secret inspiration) as thou proceedest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1,2 We never are secure from trials In Hebrew, to tempt, and to try, or to prove, are expressed by the same word. Every trial is indeed a temptation, and tends to show the dispositions of the heart, whether holy or unholy. But God proved Abraham, not to draw him to sin, as Satan tempts. Strong faith is often exercised with strong trials, and put upon hard services. The command to offer up his son, is given in such language as makes the trial more grievous; every word here is a sword. Observe, 1. The person to be offered: Take thy son; not thy bullocks and thy lambs. How willingly would Abraham have parted with them all to redeem Isaac! Thy son; not thy servant. Thine only son; thine only son by Sarah. Take Isaac, that son whom thou lovest. 2. The place: three days' journey off; so that Abraham might have time to consider, and might deliberately obey. 3. The manner: Offer him fro a burnt-offering; not only kill his son, his Isaac, but kill him as a sacrifice; kill him with all that solemn pomp and ceremony, with which he used to offer his burnt-offerings.</body></html>
