The few words that passed between father and son, the notice by the latter that amid such careful preparation no victim had been provided, the father's answer that that matter was left to God, the resolute faith of the one, and the trusting submission of the other, as "they went both of them together," form a picture full not merely of interest, but even of tragical pathos.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye</span> (for similar forms of expression cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>) <span class="cmt_word">here with the ass;</span> - partly because the beast required watching, though chiefly because the contemplated sacrifice was too solemn for any eyes but God's to witness - <span class="cmt_word">and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.</span> An act of dissimulation on the part of Abraham (Knobel, Kalisch, Murphy); an unconscious prophecy (Lyra, Junius, Rashi); the expression of a hopeful wish (Lange); a somewhat confused utterance (Calvin, Keil); the voice of his all-conquering faith (Augustine, Calvin, Wordsworth, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis), which last seems the teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:3-10 Never was any gold tried in so hot a fire. Who but Abraham would not have argued with God? Such would have been the thought of a weak heart; but Abraham knew that he had to do with a God, even Jehovah. Faith had taught him not to argue, but to obey. He is sure that what God commands is good; that what he promises cannot be broken. In matters of God, whoever consults with flesh and blood, will never offer up his Isaac to God. The good patriarch rises early, and begins his sad journey. And now he travels three days, and Isaac still is in his sight! Misery is made worse when long continued. The expression, We will come again to you, shows that Abraham expected that Isaac, being raised from the dead, would return with him. It was a very affecting question that Isaac asked him, as they were going together: My father, said Isaac; it was a melting word, which, one would think, should strike deeper in the heart of Abraham, than his knife could in the heart of Isaac. Yet he waits for his son's question. Then Abraham, where he meant not, prophesies: My son, God will provide a lamb for a burnt-offering. The Holy Spirit, by his mouth, seems to predict the Lamb of God, which he has provided, and which taketh away the sin of the world. Abraham lays the wood in order for his Isaac's funeral pile, and now tells him the amazing news: Isaac, thou art the lamb which God has provided! Abraham, no doubt, comforting him with the same hopes with which he himself by faith was comforted. Yet it is necessary that the sacrifice be bound. The great Sacrifice, which, in the fulness of time, was to be offered up, must be bound, and so must Isaac.
