It is added that hence arose a proverb "In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen," or rather, <span class= "ital">In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.</span>--The verb literally means <span class= "ital">to see, </span>or, <span class= "ital">to see to a thing, </span>and the sense of the proverb plainly is that in man's necessity God will Himself see to it, and provide due help and deliverance. The Samaritan, Syriac and Vulg. have a better reading, namely, "In the mount Jehovah will provide." This makes no change in the consonants, which alone are authoritative, but only in the vowels, which were added since the Christian era, and represent the tradition of the Jewish school of Tiberias. The LXX., without changing the vowels, translate, "In the mount Jehovah shall be seen," which would be a prophecy of the manifestation of Christ. The other two renderings, besides their general proverbial sense, point onward to the providing upon this very spot of the sacrifice that was to take away the sins of the world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm" title="But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p>But when and how did this grow into a proverb? and who added this note? It may have been inserted by Moses when he arranged these marvellous. documents; less probably by Ezra and the men of the Great Synagogue, when they collected and revised the several books of Holy Scripture after the exile. In either case, the proverb is a national testimony to the genuineness of the record, and proves that the facts narrated in it were so impressed upon the memory of Abraham's descendants, as to shape their thoughts and language.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh</span>: - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Lord will provide (Jonathan, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, etc.), rather than the Lord selects, or looks out, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. the sacrifices to be afterwards offered in the temple worship on Morish (Kalisch); or, the Lord shall appear (Oort, Kuenen), which overlooks the manifest allusion to Ver. 8 - <span class="cmt_word">as it is said to this day</span>, - or, so that it is said; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a> (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen</span> - or "it shall be provided" (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Dathe, 'Speaker's Commentary'), though by competent authorities it has been otherwise rendered. "In the mount the Lord shall appear, or be seen" (LXX.); "in the mount the Lord will see, or provide" (Vulgate, Syriac, Samaritan); "in the mount of the Lord he will be seen" (Murphy); "<span class="accented">in</span> the mount of the Lord one shall be seen," or "people appear," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people of God shall gather on this mountain for worship (Kalisch); "<span class="accented">on</span> the mountain where Jehovah appears" (Keil). Amidst such a conflict of interpretations absolute certainty is perhaps unattainable; but the sense of the proverb will probably be expressed by understanding it to mean that on the mount of Abraham's sacrifice Jehovah would afterwards reveal himself for the salvation of his people, as he then interposed for the help of Abraham - a prophecy which was afterwards fulfilled in the manifestations of the Divine glory given in the Solomonic temple and in the incarnation of Jesus Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:11-14 It was not God's intention that Isaac should actually be sacrificed, yet nobler blood than that of animals, in due time, was to be shed for sin, even the blood of the only begotten Son of God. But in the mean while God would not in any case have human sacrifices used. Another sacrifice is provided. Reference must be had to the promised Messiah, the blessed Seed. Christ was sacrificed in our stead, as this ram instead of Isaac, and his death was our discharge. And observe, that the temple, the place of sacrifice, was afterwards built upon this same mount Moriah; and Calvary, where Christ was crucified, was near. A new name was given to that place, for the encouragement of all believers, to the end of the world, cheerfully to trust in God, and obey him. Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide; probably alluding to what Abraham had said, God will provide himself a lamb. The Lord will always have his eye upon his people, in their straits and distresses, that he may give them seasonable help.</body></html>
