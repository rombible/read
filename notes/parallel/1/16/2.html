Until late times the tent was the habitation, while the house was the family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1</a>). Thus the phrase "to build a man <span class= "ital">a sure house</span>" meant, to give him lasting prosperity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm" title="And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.">1Samuel 2:35</a>). Hence, too, the close connection between building and the bestowal of children in Psalms 127. As then the children of a woman bestowed by her mistress upon the husband were regarded as belonging to the wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-3.htm" title="And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear on my knees, that I may also have children by her.">Genesis 30:3</a>), Sarah, despairing of bearing a son herself, as she was now seventy-five, and had been ten years in Canaan, concluded that her heir was to be born of a substitute.<p>As regards the morality of the act, we find that marriage with one wife was the original law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>), and that when polygamy was introduced it was coupled by the inspired narrator with violence and licence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-19.htm" title="And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.">Genesis 4:19</a>). Monogamy was the rule, as we see in the households of Noah, Terah, Isaac, and others; but many, like Esau and Jacob, allowed themselves a greater latitude. In so doing, their conduct falls below the level of Christian morality, but everyone's actions are strongly influenced by the general views of the people among whom he lives; and in Abram's case it must be said in his defence that, with so much depending on his having offspring, he took no steps to obtain another wife, but remained content with the barren Sarai. When he did take Hagar it was at his wife's request, and for a reason which seemed to them adequate, and even religious. Rachel subsequently did the same for a much lower motive. The consent of the wife was in such cases all-important; and so in India, in ancient times, it was necessary to make a second marriage valid (see Wilson's <span class= "ital">Hindu Theatre, </span>i. 179).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained us from bearing</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">hath shut me up</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my womb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, LXX.) <span class="accented">from bearing</span>. Her advancing age was rendering this every day more and more apparent. <span class="cmt_word">I pray thee go in unto my maid</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3, 9</a>). It is so far satisfactory that the proposal to make a secondary wife of Hagar did not originate with Abram; though, as Sarai's guilt in making it cannot altogether. be excused, so neither can Abram be entirely freed from fault in yielding to her solicitations. <span class="cmt_word">It may be that I may obtain children by her</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">be built up by her</span>; from <span class="accented">banah</span>, to build, whence <span class="accented">ben</span>, a son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>). Calvin notes that Sarai s desire of offspring was not prompted by natural impulse, but by the zeal of faith which made her wish to secure the promised benediction. As yet it had not been clearly intimated that Sarai was to be the mother of Abram's child; and hence her recourse to what was a prevalent practice of the times, while unjustifiable in itself, was a signal proof of her humility, of her devotion to her husband, and perhaps also of her faith in God. <span class="cmt_word">And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</span> "The faith of both was defective; not indeed with regard to the substance of the premise, but with regard to the method in which they proceeded" (Calvin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-3 Sarai, no longer expecting to have children herself, proposed to Abram to take another wife, whose children she might; her slave, whose children would be her property. This was done without asking counsel of the Lord. Unbelief worked, God's almighty power was forgotten. It was a bad example, and a source of manifold uneasiness. In every relation and situation in life there is some cross for us to bear: much of the exercise of faith consists in patiently submitting, in waiting the Lord's time, and using only those means which he appoints for the removal of the cross. Foul temptations may have very fair pretences, and be coloured with that which is very plausible. Fleshly wisdom puts us out of God's way. This would not be the case, if we would ask counsel of God by his word and by prayer, before we attempt that which is doubtful.</body></html>
