Its characteristics are great speed, love of solitude, and an untamable fondness of liberty.

As Ishmael and his offspring are here called "wild ass men," so Israel is designated by the prophet "sheep men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm">Ezekiel 36:37, 38</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His hand</span> will <span class="cmt_word">be against every man, and every man's hand against him.</span> Exemplified in the turbulent and lawless character of the Bedouin Arabs and Saracens for upwards of thirty centuries.

It is a great mercy to be stopped in a sinful way, either by conscience or by providence. Whence comest thou? Consider that thou art running from duty, and the privileges thou wast blest with in Abram's tent. It is good to live in a religious family, which those ought to consider who have this advantage. Whither wilt thou go? Thou art running into sin; if Hagar return to Egypt, she will return to idol gods, and into danger in the wilderness through which she must travel. Recollecting who we are, would often teach us our duty. Inquiring whence we came, would show us our sin and folly. Considering whither we shall go, discovers our danger and misery. And those who leave their space and duty, must hasten their return, how mortifying soever it be. The declaration of the Angel, I will, shows this Angel was the eternal Word and Son of God. Hagar could not but admire the Lord's mercy, and feel, Have I, who am so unworthy, been favoured with a gracious visit from the Lord? She was brought to a better temper, returned, and by her behaviour softened Sarai, and received more gentle treatment. Would that we were always suitably impressed with this thought, Thou God seest me!</body></html>
