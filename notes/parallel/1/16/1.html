and though papyrus was known at Ur (<span class= "ital">Trans. Soc. Bibl. Arch., </span>i. 343, ii. 430), yet the absence of any convenient writing material for ordinary use would oblige men in those ancient days to content themselves with short inscriptions, like those tablets of clay brought from Ur, many of which now in the British. Museum are said to be considerably older than the time of Abram. The narrator would naturally make but few alterations in such precious-documents, and hence a certain amount of recapitulation, like that which we find in the Books of Samuel, where again we have not a narrative from one pen, but the arrangement of materials already ancient. As, however, the Divine object was the revealing to mankind of the way by which God would raise up man from the fall, the narrator would be guided by inspiration in his choice of materials, and in the omission of such things as did not fall in with this purpose; and the evident reverence with which he deals with these records is a warrant to us of their genuineness. Such additions as the remark that the "Valley of Shaveh" was many centuries later called "the King's Dale" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-17.htm" title="And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm" title="Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.">2Samuel 18:18</a>) are generally acknowledged to have been the work of Ezra and the men of the Great Synagogue, after the return from the exile.<p><span class= "bld">Hagar.</span>--As this word apparently comes from the Arabic verb <span class= "ital">to flee, </span>it cannot have been her original name, unless we suppose that she really was an Arab fugitive who had taken refuge in Egypt. More probably she was an Egyptian woman who had escaped to Abram when he was in the Negeb, and had then received this appellation, which virtually means <span class= "ital">run-away.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children</span> (literally, <span class="accented">bare not to him</span>, notwithstanding the promise; the barrenness of Sarai being introduced as the point of departure for the ensuing narrative, and emphasized as the cause or occasion of the subsequent transaction): <span class="cmt_word">and she had</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to her</span> (there was) - <span class="cmt_word">an handmaid, an Egyptian</span> (obtained probably while in the house of Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>) - whose name was <span class="cmt_word">Hagar</span> <span class="accented">-</span> "<span class="accented">flight</span>," from <span class="accented">hagar</span>, to flee. Cf. Hegirah, the flight of Mahomet. Not her original designation, but given to her afterwards, either because of her flight from Egypt (Ambrose, Wordsworth), or because of her escape from her mistress (Michaelis, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Though not the imaginary or mythical (Bohlen), it is doubtful if she was the real (Ainsworth, Bush), ancestor of the Hagarenes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10, 19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-31.htm">1 Chronicles 27:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-3 Sarai, no longer expecting to have children herself, proposed to Abram to take another wife, whose children she might; her slave, whose children would be her property. This was done without asking counsel of the Lord. Unbelief worked, God's almighty power was forgotten. It was a bad example, and a source of manifold uneasiness. In every relation and situation in life there is some cross for us to bear: much of the exercise of faith consists in patiently submitting, in waiting the Lord's time, and using only those means which he appoints for the removal of the cross. Foul temptations may have very fair pretences, and be coloured with that which is very plausible. Fleshly wisdom puts us out of God's way. This would not be the case, if we would ask counsel of God by his word and by prayer, before we attempt that which is doubtful.</body></html>
