The act of Sarai (cf. the similar behavior of Stratonice, the wife of King Deiotarus, who, according to Plutarch, gave her maid Electra to her husband, and so obtained an heir to the crown) is as little to be imitated as the conduct of Abram. The apparent repetitions in Vers. 1-3 do not require the hypothesis of different authorship (Tuch, Colenso, Bleek, Davidson) for their explanation, but are characteristic of the genius of Hebrew composition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1-10</a>), and may even be considerably removed by connecting Vers. 1, 2 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, and commencing the new sub-section with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-3.htm">Genesis 16:3</a> (Quarry, p. 331). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-3 Sarai, no longer expecting to have children herself, proposed to Abram to take another wife, whose children she might; her slave, whose children would be her property. This was done without asking counsel of the Lord. Unbelief worked, God's almighty power was forgotten. It was a bad example, and a source of manifold uneasiness. In every relation and situation in life there is some cross for us to bear: much of the exercise of faith consists in patiently submitting, in waiting the Lord's time, and using only those means which he appoints for the removal of the cross. Foul temptations may have very fair pretences, and be coloured with that which is very plausible. Fleshly wisdom puts us out of God's way. This would not be the case, if we would ask counsel of God by his word and by prayer, before we attempt that which is doubtful.</body></html>
