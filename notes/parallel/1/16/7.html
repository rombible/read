With more force of reason believed to have been the Divine Being himself, who already as Jehovah had appeared to Abram (the Fathers, the Reformers, Hengstenberg, Keil, Lange, Havernick, Nitzsch, Ebrard, Steir, Kalisch, Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth, Candlish), since - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">Maleach Jehovah</span> explicitly identifies himself with Jehovah (Ver. 10) and Elohim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-12.htm">Genesis 22:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Those to whom he makes his presence known recognize him as Divine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-16.htm">Genesis 28:16-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15, 20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The Biblical writers constantly speak of him as Divine, calling him Jehovah without the least reserve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The doctrine here implied of a plurality of persons in the Godhead is in complete accordance with earlier foreshadowings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>) and later revelations of the same truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The organic unity of Scripture would be broken if it could be proved that the central point in the Old Testament revelation was a creature angel, while that of the New is the incarnation of the God-Man. <span class="cmt_word">Found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness</span>. Properly an uninhabited district suitable for pasturing flocks, from a root signifying to lead to pasture; hence a sterile, sandy country, like that here referred to, Arabia Deserta, bordering on Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the fountain</span>.

Hagar was clearly directing her flight to Egypt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:7-16 Hagar was out of her place, and out of the way of her duty, and going further astray, when the Angel found her. It is a great mercy to be stopped in a sinful way, either by conscience or by providence. Whence comest thou? Consider that thou art running from duty, and the privileges thou wast blest with in Abram's tent. It is good to live in a religious family, which those ought to consider who have this advantage. Whither wilt thou go? Thou art running into sin; if Hagar return to Egypt, she will return to idol gods, and into danger in the wilderness through which she must travel. Recollecting who we are, would often teach us our duty. Inquiring whence we came, would show us our sin and folly. Considering whither we shall go, discovers our danger and misery. And those who leave their space and duty, must hasten their return, how mortifying soever it be. The declaration of the Angel, I will, shows this Angel was the eternal Word and Son of God. Hagar could not but admire the Lord's mercy, and feel, Have I, who am so unworthy, been favoured with a gracious visit from the Lord? She was brought to a better temper, returned, and by her behaviour softened Sarai, and received more gentle treatment. Would that we were always suitably impressed with this thought, Thou God seest me!</body></html>
