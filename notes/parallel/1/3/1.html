This quality of the serpent was in itself innocent, and even admirable, and accordingly the LXX. translate <span class= "ital">prudent; </span>but it was made use of by the tempter to deceive Eve; for, it has been remarked, she would not be surprised on finding herself spoken to by so sagacious a creature. If this be so, it follows that Eve must have dwelt in Paradise long enough to have learnt something of the habits of the animals around her, though she had never studied them so earnestly as Adam, not having felt that want of a companion which had made even his state of happiness so dull.<p><span class= "bld">And he said unto the woman.</span>--The leading point of the narrative is that the temptation came upon man from without, and through the woman. Such questions, therefore, as whether it were a real serpent or Satan under a serpent-like form, whether it spake with a real voice, and whether the narrative describes a literal occurrence or is allegorical, are better left unanswered. God has given us the account of man's temptation and fall, and the entry of sin into the world, in this actual form; and the more reverent course is to draw from the narrative the lessons it was evidently intended to teach us, and not enter upon too curious speculations. We are dealing with records of a vast and hoar antiquity, given to man when he was in a state of great simplicity, and with his intellect only partly developed, and we cannot expect to find them as easy to understand as the pages of modern history.<p><span class= "bld">Yea, hath God said . . .</span>?--There is a tone of surprise in these words, as if the tempter could not bring himself to believe that such a command had been given. Can it really be true, he asks, that Elohim has subjected you to such a prohibition? How unworthy and wrong of Him! Neither the serpent nor the woman use the title--common throughout this section--of Jehovah-Elohim, a sure sign that there was a thoughtful purpose in giving this appellation to the Deity. It is the impersonal God of creation to whom the tempter refers, and the woman follows his guidance, forgetting that it was Jehovah, the loving personal Being in covenant with them, who had really given them the command.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - How long the paradisiacal state of innocence and felicity continued the historian does not declare, probably as not falling within the scope of his immediate design. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a> has been thought, though without sufficient reason, to hint that man's Eden life was of comparatively short duration. The present chapter relates the tragic incident which brought it to a termination. Into the question of the origin of moral evil in the universe it does not enter. The metaphysical problem of how the first thought of sin could arise in innocent beings it does not attempt to resolve. It seeks to explain the genesis of evil with reference to man. Nor even with regard to this does it aim at an exhaustive dissertation, but only at such a statement of its beginnings as shall demonstrate that God is not the author of sin, but that man, by his own free volition, brought his pristine state of purity and happiness to an end. A due regard to this, the specific object of the Mosaic narrative, will go far to answer not a few of the objections which have been taken to its historic credibility. Like the Mosaic record of creation, the Biblical story of the fall has been impugned on a variety of grounds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">doctrine</span> of a fall, which this chapter clearly teaches, has been assailed as inconsistent with the dictates of a speculative philosophy, if not also with the tenets of a Scriptural theology. While in the present narrative the origin of sin is distinctly traced back to the free volition of man acting without constraint, though not without temptation, in opposition to the Divine will, a more exact psychological analysis, it is alleged, declares it to have been from the first a necessity, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">metaphysically</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being involved in the very conception of a finite will (Spinoza, Leibnitz, Baur); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">historically</span>, "<span class="accented">as</span> the expression of the necessary transition of the human race from the state of nature to that of culture" (Fichte, Kant, Schiller), or as developing itself in obedience to the law of antagonism and conflict (John Seotus Erigena, Hegel, Sehleiermacher, Schelling); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">theologically</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> predetermined by a Divine decree (supralapsarianism). Without offering any separate refutation of these anti-Scriptural theories, it may suffice to say that in all questions affecting man's responsibility, the testimony of the individual consciousness, the ultimate ground of appeal, apart from revelation, affirms moral evil to be no all-controlling necessity, but the free product of the will of the creature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The <span class="accented">narrative</span> of the fall has been impugned - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> On the ground of its <span class="accented">miraculous character</span>. But unless we are prepared to equate the supernatural with the impossible and incredible, we must decline to admit the force of such objections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> On the ground of its <span class="accented">mythical form</span>, resembling as it does, in some slight degree, Oriental traditions, and in particular the Persian legend of Ormuzd and Ahriman (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">infra</span>, 'Traditions of the Fall'). But here the same remark will apply as was made in connection with the similarity alleged to exist between the Mosaic and heathen cosmogonies: it is immeasurably easier and more natural to account for the resemblance of Oriental legend to Biblical history, by supposing the former to be a traditional reflection of the latter, than it is to explain the unchallengable superiority of the latter to the former, even in a literary point of view, not to mention ethical aspects at all, by tracing both to a common source - the philosophic or theologic consciousness of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> There are also those who, while neither repudiating it on the ground of miracle, nor discrediting it as a heathen myth, yet decline to accept it as other than a <span class="accented">parabolic</span> or allegorical narration of what transpired in the spiritual experience of the first pair. History is often a parable of truth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">the serpent</span>. <span class="accented">Nachash</span>, from <span class="accented">nachash -</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in Kal, to hiss (unused), with allusion to the hissing sound emitted by the reptile (Gesenius, Furst), though it has been objected that prior to the fall the serpent could hardly have been called by a name derived from its present constitution (Delitzsch); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in Piel, to whisper, use sorcery, find out by divination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>), suggestive of the creature's wisdom (Bush), Which, however, is regarded as doubtful (Furst); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to shine (unused, though supplying the noun <span class="accented">nechsheth</span>, brass, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>), referring to its glossy shining appearance, and in par-titular its bright glistening eye: cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (T.

If applied to the serpent in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Aquila, Keil, Lange, Macdonald), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>it can only be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> metaphorically for the devil, whose instrument it was; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> proleptically, with reference to the results of the temptation; for in itself, as one of God's creatures, it must have been originally good. It seems more correct to regard the epithet as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), and to hold that Moses, in referring to the subtlety of this creature, "does not so much point out a fault as attribute praise to nature" (Calvin), and describes qualities which in themselves were good, such as quickness of sight, swiftness of motion, activity of the self-preserving instinct, seemingly intelligent adaptation -of means to end, with perhaps a glance, in the use of '<span class="accented">arum</span>, at the sleekness of its glossy skin; but which were capable of being perverted to an unnatural use by the power and craft of a superior intelligence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c9;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Than any</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was subtil more than any</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>beast of the field which the Lord God had made</span>. The comparison here instituted is commonly regarded as a proof that the tempter was a literal serpent, though Macdonald finds in the contrast between it and all other creatures, as well as in the ascription to it of pre-eminent subtlety, which is not now a characteristic of serpents, an intimation that the reptile was no creature of earth, or one that received its form from God," an opinion scarcely different from that of Cyril (100. Julian., lib. 3), that it was only the <span class="accented">simulacrum</span> of a serpent. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the curse pronounced upon the serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>) would seem to be deprived of all force if the subject of it had been only an apparition or an unreal creature; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the language of the New Testament in referring to man's temptation implies its literality (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). "We are perfectly justified in concluding, from this mention of the fall, that Paul spoke of it as an actual occurrence" (Olshausen). Adam Clarke contends with much enthusiasm that the tempter was not a serpent, but an ape or orangutan. <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>. Not as originally endowed with speech (Josephus, Clarke), or gifted at this particular time with the power of articulation ('Ephrem., lib. de paradiso,' c. 27, quoted by Willet), but simply as used by the devil (Augustine, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), who from this circumstance is commonly styled in Scripture '<span class="accented">The</span> serpent," "the old serpent," "that old serpent" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>). Nor is it more difficult to understand the speaking of the serpent when possessed by Satan, than the talking of Balaam s ass when the Lord opened its mouth (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28-30</a>). Equally with the idea that the devil was the only agent in man s temptation, and that the serpent is purely the allegorical dress in which the historian clothes him (Eusebius, Cajetan, Quarry, Alford), must the notion be rejected that there was nothing but a serpent (Aben Ezra, Kalisch, Knobel). Why, if there was an evil spirit manipulating the reptile, the historian did not say so has been explained <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on the ground that the belief in the devil was then foreign to the Hebrews (Knobel); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that up to this point in the narrative there is no mention of the devil (White of Dorchester); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that Moses simply wished to <span class="accented">be rei gestae scriptor non interpres</span> (Pererins); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it was unnecessary, those for whom he wrote being sufficiently capable of discerning that the serpent was not the prime mover in the transaction (Candlish); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> that "by a homely and uncultivated style he accommodates what he delivers to the capacity of the people" (Calvin); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> that his object being merely to show that God had no hand in man's temptation, but that Adam sinned of himself, it was not needful to do more than recite the incident as it appeared to the senses (White); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> that he wished "<span class="accented">to</span> avoid encouraging the disposition to transfer the blame to the evil spirit which tempted man, and thus reduce sin to a mere act of weakness" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the woman</span>. As the weaker of the two, and more likely to be easily persuaded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-14.htm">1 Timothy 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). Cf. Satan's assault on Job through his wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>). Milton's idea that Eve desired to be independent, and had withdrawn herself out of Adam's sight, it has been well remarked, "<span class="accented">sets</span> up a beginning of the fall before the fall itself" (Lunge). <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span>. Is it even so that? (Gesenius). Is it really so that! (Ewald, Furst, Keil). <span class="accented">Etiamne</span>, <span class="accented">vel Itane</span> (Calvin). A question either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> spoken in irony, as if the meaning were, "Very like it is that. God careth what you eat!" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> inquiring the reason of the prohibition (LXX., - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">cur praecepit vobis Deus</span>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> simply soliciting information (Chaldee Paraphrase); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> most likely expressing surprise and astonishment, with the view of suggesting distrust of the Divine goodness and disbelief in the Divine veracity (Ewald, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Keil, Macdonald, Lunge). The conversation may have been commenced by the tempter, and the question "thrown out as a feeler for some weak point where the fidelity of the woman might be shaken" (Murphy); but it is more likely that the devil spoke in continuation of a colloquy which is not reported (Kalisch, Macdonald), which has led some, on the supposition that already many arguments had been adduced to substantiate the Divine severity, to render "yea" by "<span class="accented">quanto magis</span>," as if the meaning were, "How much more is this a proof of God's unkindness!" (Aben Ezra, Kimchi). <span class="cmt_word">Hath God said</span>. "The tempter felt it necessary to change the living personal God into a merely general <span class="accented">numen divinum"</span> (Keil); but the Elohim of <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. He was not a mere <span class="accented">numen divinum</span> As much astray is the observation that Satan wished to avoid profaning the name of Jehovah (Knobel). Better is the remark that the serpent could not utter the name Jehovah as his assault was directed against the paradisiacal covenant of God with man (Lange). By using the name Elohim instead of Jehovah the covenant relationship of God towards man was obscured, and man's position in the garden represented as that of a subject rather than a son. As it were, Eve was first placed at the furthest distance possible from the supreme, and then assailed. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden.</span> I.e. either accepting the present rendering as correct, which the Hebrew will bear, - "Are there any trees in the garden of which you may not eat?" "<span class="accented">Is</span> it really so that God hath prohibited you from some?" (Calvin), - or, translating <span class="accented">lo-kol</span> as <span class="accented">not</span> any - Latin, <span class="accented">nullus</span> (Gesenius, &sect; 152, 1) - "Hath God said ye shall not eat of any?" (Macdonald, Keil). According to the first the devil simply seeks to impeach the Divine goodness; according to the second he also aims at intensifying the Divine prohibition. The second rendering appears to be supported by the fitness of Eve's reply. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Satan assaulted our first parents, to draw them to sin, and the temptation proved fatal to them. The tempter was the devil, in the shape and likeness of a serpent. Satan's plan was to draw our first parents to sin, and so to separate between them and their God. Thus the devil was from the beginning a murderer, and the great mischief maker. The person tempted was the woman: it was Satan's policy to enter into talk with her when she was alone. There are many temptations to which being alone gives great advantage; but the communion of saints tends very much to their strength and safety. Satan took advantage by finding her near the forbidden tree. They that would not eat the forbidden fruit, must not come near the forbidden tree. Satan tempted Eve, that by her he might tempt Adam. It is his policy to send temptations by hands we do not suspect, and by those that have most influence upon us. Satan questioned whether it were a sin or not, to eat of this tree. He did not disclose his design at first, but he put a question which seemed innocent. Those who would be safe, need to be shy of talking with the tempter. He quoted the command wrong. He spoke in a taunting way. The devil, as he is a liar, so he is a scoffer from the beginning; and scoffers are his children. It is the craft of Satan to speak of the Divine law as uncertain or unreasonable, and so to draw people to sin; it is our wisdom to keep up a firm belief of God's command, and a high respect for it. Has God said, Ye shall not lie, nor take his name in vain, nor be drunk, etc.? Yes, I am sure he has, and it is well said; and by his grace I will abide by it. It was Eve's weakness to enter into this talk with the serpent: she might have perceived by his question, that he had no good design, and should therefore have started back. Satan teaches men first to doubt, and then to deny. He promises advantage from their eating this fruit. He aims to make them discontented with their present state, as if it were not so good as it might be, and should be. No condition will of itself bring content, unless the mind be brought to it. He tempts them to seek preferment, as if they were fit to be gods. Satan ruined himself by desiring to be like the Most High, therefore he sought to infect our first parents with the same desire, that he might ruin them too. And still the devil draws people into his interest, by suggesting to them hard thoughts of God, and false hopes of advantage by sin. Let us, therefore, always think well of God as the best good, and think ill of sin as the worst evil: thus let us resist the devil, and he will flee from us.</body></html>
