Until sin entered the world no sacrifices could have been offered; and if, therefore, these were the skins of animals offered in sacrifice, as many suppose, Adam must in some way, immediately after the fall, have been taught that without shedding of blood is no remission of sin, but that God will accept a vicarious sacrifice. This is perhaps the most tenable view; and if, with Knobel, we see in this arrival at the idea of sacrifice a rapid development in Adam of thought and intellect, yet it may not have been entirely spontaneous, but the effect of divinely-inspired convictions rising up within his soul. It shows also that the innocence of our first parents was gone. In his happy state Adam had studied the animals, and tamed them and made them his friends; now a sense of guilt urges him to inflict upon them pain and suffering and death. But in the first sacrifice was laid the foundation of the whole Mosaical dispensation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a> that of the Gospel. Moreover, from sacrificial worship there was alleviation for man's bodily wants, and he went forth equipped with raiment suited for the harder lot that awaited him outside the garden; and, better far, there was peace for his soul, and the thought--even if still but faint and dim--of the possibility for him of an atonement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats</span> (<span class="accented">cathnoth</span>, from <span class="accented">cathan</span>, to cover; cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>; Sanscrit, <span class="accented">katam</span>; English, <span class="accented">cotton</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of skin</span> (<span class="accented">or</span>, the skin of a man, from <span class="accented">ur</span>, to be naked, hence a hide). Neither their bodies (Origen), nor garments of the bark of trees (Gregory Nazianzen), nor miraculously-fashioned apparel (Grotius), nor clothing made from the serpent's skin (R. Jonathan), but tunics prepared from the skins of animals, slaughtered possibly for food, as it is not certain that the Edenie man was a vegetarian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>), though more probably slain in sacrifice. Though said to have been made by God, "it is not proper so to understand the words, as if God had been a furrier, or a servant to sew clothes" (Calvin). God being said to make or do what he gives orders or instructions to be made or done. Willet and Macdonald, however, prefer to think that the garments were actually fashioned by God. Bush finds in the mention of Adam and his wife an intimation that they were furnished with different kinds of apparel, and suggests that on this fact is based the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a> against the interchange of raiment between the sexes. <span class="cmt_word">And clothed them.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To show them how their mortal bodies might be defended from cold and other injuries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To cover their nakedness for comeliness' sake; <span class="accented">vestimenta honoris</span> (Chaldee Paraphrase). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To teach them the lawfulness of using the beasts of the field, as for food, so for clothing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> To give a rule that modest and decent, not costly or sumptuous, apparel should be used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> That they might know the difference between God's works and man's invention - between coats of leather and aprons of leaves; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> To put them in mind of their mortality by their raiment of dead beasts' skins - talibus indici oportebat peccatorem ut essent mortalitatis indi-cium: Origen" (Wilier). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> "That they might feel their degradation - quia vestes ex ca materia confectae, belluinum quiddam magis saperent, quam lineae vel laneae - and be reminded of their sin" (Calvin).

Bonar recognizes in Jehovah Elohim at the gate of Eden, clothing the first transgressors, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, as the High Priest of our salvation, had a right to the skins of the burnt offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>), and who, to prefigure his own work, appropriated them for covering the pardoned pair. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:20,21 God named the man, and called him Adam, which signifies red earth; Adam named the woman, and called her Eve, that is, life. Adam bears the name of the dying body, Eve of the living soul. Adam probably had regard to the blessing of a Redeemer, the promised Seed, in calling his wife Eve, or life; for He should be the life of all believers, and in Him all the families of the earth should be blessed. See also God's care for our first parents, notwithstanding their sin. Clothes came in with sin. Little reason have we to be proud of our clothes, which are but the badges of our shame. When God made clothes for our first parents, he made them warm and strong, but coarse and very plain; not robes of scarlet, but coats of skin. Let those that are meanly clad, learn from hence not to complain. Having food and a covering, let them be content; they are as well off as Adam and Eve. And let those that are finely clad, learn not to make the putting on of apparel their adorning. The beasts, from whose skins they were clothed, it is supposed were slain, not for man's food, but for sacrifice, to typify Christ, the great Sacrifice. Adam and Eve made for themselves aprons of fig-leaves, a covering too narrow for them to wrap themselves in, Isa 28:20. Such are all the rags of our own righteousness. But God made them coats of skin, large, strong, durable, and fit for them: such is the righteousness of Christ; therefore put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
