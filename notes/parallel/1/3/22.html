By the fall man had sunk morally, but grown mentally. He had asserted his independence, had exercised the right of choosing for himself, and had attained to a knowledge without which his endowment of free-will would have remained in abeyance. There is something painful and humiliating in the idea of Chrysostom and other Fathers that the Deity was speaking ironically, or even with insult (Augustine). All those qualities which constitute man's likeness to God--free-will, self-dependence, the exercise of reason and of choice--had been developed by the fall, and Adam was now a very different being from what he had been in the days of his simple innocency.<p><span class= "bld">Lest he put forth his hand.</span>--Adam had exercised the power of marring God's work, and if an unending physical life were added to the gift of freewill now in revolt against God, his condition and that of mankind would become most miserable. Man is still to attain to immortality, but it must now be through struggle, sorrow, penitence, faith, and death. Hence a paradise is no fit home for him. The Divine mercy, therefore, commands Adam to quit it, in order that he may live under conditions better suited for his moral and spiritual good.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God said</span>. <span class="accented">Verba insultantis</span> (Augustine); <span class="accented">ironica reprobatio</span> (Calvin). But "irony at the expense of a wretched, tempted soul might well befit Satan, but not the Lord" (Delitzsch), and is altogether inconsistent with the footing of grace on which man was placed immediately upon his fall. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the man is become as one of us.</span> Not the angels (Kalisch), but the Divine Persons (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>). It is scarcely likely that Jehovah alludes to the words of the tempter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To know good and evil</span>. Implying an acquaintance with good and evil which did not belong to him in the state of innocence. The language seems to hint that a one-sided acquaintance with good and evil, such as that possessed by the first pair in the garden and the unfallen angels in heaven, is not so complete a knowledge of the inherent beauty of the one and essential turpitude of the other as is acquired by beings who pass through the experience of a fall, and that the only way in which a finite being can approximate to such a comprehensive knowledge of evil as the Deity possesses without personal contact - can see it as it lies everlastingly spread out before his infinite mind - is by going down into it and learning what it is through personal experience (cf. Candlish, <span class="accented">in loco</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.</span> On the meaning of the tree of life v/de <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>. Neither <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> lest by eating of the fruit he should recover that immortal life which he no longer "it possessed (Kalisch), as is certain that man would not have been able, had he even devoured the whole tree, to enjoy life against the will of God" (Calvin); nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> lest the first pair, through participation of the tree, should confer upon themselves the attribute of <span class="accented">undyingness</span>, which would not be the <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of salvation, but its opposite, the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the accursed (Keil, Lange, T. Lewis, Wordsworth); but either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> lest man should conceive the idea that immortality might still be secured by eating of the tree, instead of trusting in the promised seed, and under this false impression attempt to take its fruit, which, in his case, would have been equivalent to an attempt to justify himself by works instead of faith (Calvin, Macdonald); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> lest he should endeavor to partake of the symbol of immortality, which he could not again do until his sin was expiated and himself purified (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-14.htm">Revelation 22:14</a>; Candlish). The remaining portion of the sentence is omitted, <span class="accented">anakoloutha</span> or aposiopesis being not infrequent in impassioned speech (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-13.htm">Job 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). The force of the ellipsis or expressive silence may be gathered from the succeeding words of the historian. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-24 God bid man go out; told him he should no longer occupy and enjoy that garden: but man liked the place, and was unwilling to leave it, therefore God made him go out. This signified the shutting out of him, and all his guilty race, from that communion with God, which was the bliss and glory of paradise. But man was only sent to till the ground out of which he was taken. He was sent to a place of toil, not to a place of torment. Our first parents were shut out from the privileges of their state of innocency, yet they were not left to despair. The way to the tree of life was shut. It was henceforward in vain for him and his to expect righteousness, life, and happiness, by the covenant of works; for the command of that covenant being broken, the curse of it is in full force: we are all undone, if we are judged by that covenant. God revealed this to Adam, not to drive him to despair, but to quicken him to look for life and happiness in the promised Seed, by whom a new and living way into the holiest is laid open for us.</body></html>
