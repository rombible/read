It was a high bait which the tempter offered; and Eve, who at first had answered rightly, and who as yet knew nothing of falsehood, dallied with the temptation, and was lost. But we must not comment too severely upon her conduct.

And, as usual, the tempter kept the promise to the ear. Eve knew good and evil, but only by feeling evil within herself.

Thus the serpent practically charges the Deity with <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> envy of his creatures' happiness, as if he meant to say, Depend upon it, it is not through any fear of your dying from its fruit that the tree has been interdicted, but through fear of your becoming rivals to your Master himself; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with falsehood - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> in affirming that to be true which he knew to be false; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in doing this while delivering his law; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> in pretending to be careful of man's safety while in reality he was only jealous of his own honor. <span class="cmt_word">That in the day ye eat thereof</span>. Cf. the Divine prohibition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>), the exact terms of which are again used - a mark of growing aggressiveness towards the woman, and of special audacity towards God. The prohibition employs the singular number, being addressed to Adam only; the devil employs the plural, as his words were meant not for Eve alone, but for her husband with her. <span class="cmt_word">Your eyes shall be opened.</span> "To open the eyes," the usual Biblical phrase for restoring sight to the blind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>), is also used to denote the impartation of power to perceive (physically, mentally, spiritually) objects not otherwise discernible (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-19.htm">Genesis 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>). Here it was designed to be ambiguous; like all Satan's oracles, suggesting to the hearer the attainment of higher wisdom, but meaning in the intention of the speaker only a discovery of their nakedness. The same ambiguity attaches to the devil's exposition of his own text. <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall be as gods.</span> Literally, as <span class="accented">Elohim</span>; not &c <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">sicut dii</span> (Vulgate), as gods (A.V.), as the angels (R. Jonathan), as the devils (Ainsworth), <span class="accented">daemonibusque</span>, <span class="accented">diisve similes</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller), as princes (White); but as the supreme Deity (Calvin, Keil, Kalisch, <span class="accented">et alia</span>) <span class="accented">- ostensibly</span> a promise of divinity. Knowing good and evil. As they knew this already from the prohibition, the language must imply a fullness and accuracy of understanding such as was competent only to Elohim (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 22) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Satan assaulted our first parents, to draw them to sin, and the temptation proved fatal to them. The tempter was the devil, in the shape and likeness of a serpent. Satan's plan was to draw our first parents to sin, and so to separate between them and their God. Thus the devil was from the beginning a murderer, and the great mischief maker. The person tempted was the woman: it was Satan's policy to enter into talk with her when she was alone. There are many temptations to which being alone gives great advantage; but the communion of saints tends very much to their strength and safety. Satan took advantage by finding her near the forbidden tree. They that would not eat the forbidden fruit, must not come near the forbidden tree. Satan tempted Eve, that by her he might tempt Adam. It is his policy to send temptations by hands we do not suspect, and by those that have most influence upon us. Satan questioned whether it were a sin or not, to eat of this tree. He did not disclose his design at first, but he put a question which seemed innocent. Those who would be safe, need to be shy of talking with the tempter. He quoted the command wrong. He spoke in a taunting way. The devil, as he is a liar, so he is a scoffer from the beginning; and scoffers are his children. It is the craft of Satan to speak of the Divine law as uncertain or unreasonable, and so to draw people to sin; it is our wisdom to keep up a firm belief of God's command, and a high respect for it. Has God said, Ye shall not lie, nor take his name in vain, nor be drunk, etc.? Yes, I am sure he has, and it is well said; and by his grace I will abide by it. It was Eve's weakness to enter into this talk with the serpent: she might have perceived by his question, that he had no good design, and should therefore have started back. Satan teaches men first to doubt, and then to deny. He promises advantage from their eating this fruit. He aims to make them discontented with their present state, as if it were not so good as it might be, and should be. No condition will of itself bring content, unless the mind be brought to it. He tempts them to seek preferment, as if they were fit to be gods. Satan ruined himself by desiring to be like the Most High, therefore he sought to infect our first parents with the same desire, that he might ruin them too. And still the devil draws people into his interest, by suggesting to them hard thoughts of God, and false hopes of advantage by sin. Let us, therefore, always think well of God as the best good, and think ill of sin as the worst evil: thus let us resist the devil, and he will flee from us.</body></html>
