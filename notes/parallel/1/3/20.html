Adam's condition was now one of death, but his wife thereby attained a higher value in his sight. Through her alone could human life be continued, and the "woman's seed" be obtained who was to raise up man from his fall. While, then, woman's punishment consists in the multiplication of her "sorrow and conception," she becomes thereby only more precious to man; and while "her desire is to her husband," Adam turns from his own punishment to look upon her with more tender love. He has no word for her of reproach, and we thus see that the common interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm" title="And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.">Genesis 3:12</a> is more than doubtful. Adam throws no blame either on Eve or on his Maker, because he does not feel himself to blame. He rather means, "How could I err in following one so noble, and in whom I recognise Thy best and choicest gift?" And with this agrees <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm" title="And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her; and he did eat.">Genesis 3:6</a>, where Adam partakes of the fruit without hesitation or thought of resistance. And so here he turns to her and calls her <span class= "ital">Chavvah, </span>his life, his compensation for his loss, and the antidote for the sentence of death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Arraigned, convicted, judged, the guilty but pardoned pair prepare to leave their garden home - the woman to begin her experience of sorrow, dependence, and subjection; the man to enter upon his life career of hardship and toil, and both to meet their doom of certain, though it might be of long-delayed, death. The impression made upon their hearts by the Divine Clemency, though not directly stated by the historian, may be inferred from what is next recorded as having happened within the precincts of Eden ere they entered on their exile. <span class="cmt_word">And Adam called</span> (not prior to the fall, reading the verb as a pluperfect (Calvin), nor after the birth of Cain, transferring the present verse to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a> (Knobel), but subsequent to the promise of the woman's seed, and preceding their ejection from the garden) <span class="cmt_word">his wife's name Eve</span>. <span class="accented">Chavvah</span>, from <span class="accented">chavvah = chayyah</span>, to live (cf. with the arganic rent <span class="accented">chvi</span> the Sanscrit, <span class="accented">giv</span>; Gothic, <span class="accented">quiv</span>; Latin, <span class="accented">rive</span>, <span class="accented">gigno</span>, <span class="accented">vigeo</span>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, etc., the fundamental idea being to breathe, to respire - Furst), is correctly rendered life - Work) by the LXX., Josephus, Philo, Gesenins, Delitzsch, Macdonald, etc. Lange, regarding it as an abbreviated form of the participle <span class="accented">mechavvah</span>, understands it to signify "the sustenance, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the propagation of life; while Knobel, viewing it as an adjective, hints at woman's peculiar function - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> - to quicken seed (Genesis 19:82) as supplying the explanation. Whether appended by the narrator (Delitzsch, Lange) or uttered by Adam (Kalisch, Macdonald), the words which follow give its true import and exegesis. <span class="cmt_word">Because she was the mother</span> (am - Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; Welsh, <span class="accented">mani</span>; Copt., <span class="accented">man</span>; German and English, mama; - Gesenius) <span class="cmt_word">of all living.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Of Adam's children, though in this respect she might have been so styled from the beginning; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of all who should truly live in the sense of being the woman's seed, as distinguished from the seed of the serpent. In Adam's giving a second name to his wife has been discerned the first assertion of his sovereignty or lordship over woman to which he was promoted subsequent to the fall (Luther), though this seems to be negatived by the fact that Adam exercised the same prerogative immediately on her creation; an act of thoughtlessness on the part of Adam, in that, "being himself immersed in death, he should have called his wife by so proud a name" (Calvin); a proof of his incredulity (Rupertus). With a juster appreciation of the spirit of the narrative, modern expositors generally regard it as a striking testimony to his faith. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:20,21 God named the man, and called him Adam, which signifies red earth; Adam named the woman, and called her Eve, that is, life. Adam bears the name of the dying body, Eve of the living soul. Adam probably had regard to the blessing of a Redeemer, the promised Seed, in calling his wife Eve, or life; for He should be the life of all believers, and in Him all the families of the earth should be blessed. See also God's care for our first parents, notwithstanding their sin. Clothes came in with sin. Little reason have we to be proud of our clothes, which are but the badges of our shame. When God made clothes for our first parents, he made them warm and strong, but coarse and very plain; not robes of scarlet, but coats of skin. Let those that are meanly clad, learn from hence not to complain. Having food and a covering, let them be content; they are as well off as Adam and Eve. And let those that are finely clad, learn not to make the putting on of apparel their adorning. The beasts, from whose skins they were clothed, it is supposed were slain, not for man's food, but for sacrifice, to typify Christ, the great Sacrifice. Adam and Eve made for themselves aprons of fig-leaves, a covering too narrow for them to wrap themselves in, Isa 28:20. Such are all the rags of our own righteousness. But God made them coats of skin, large, strong, durable, and fit for them: such is the righteousness of Christ; therefore put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
