Adam departed unwillingly from his happy home, and with the consciousness that he had incurred the Divine anger. It was the consequence of his sin, and was a punishment, even if necessary for his good under the changed circumstances produced by his disobedience. On the duration of Adam's stay in Paradise, see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>at end of this book.<p><span class= "bld">He placed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">caused to dwell. </span>The return to Paradise was closed for ever.<p><span class= "bld">At the east of the garden of Eden.</span>--Adam still had his habitation in the land of Eden, and probably in the immediate neighbourhood of Paradise. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-16.htm" title="And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelled in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.">Genesis 4:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Cherubims.</span>--The cherub was a symbolical figure, representing strength and majesty. The ordinary derivation, from a root signifying to <span class= "ital">carve, grave, </span>and especially to <span class= "ital">plough, </span>compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm" title="And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.">Exodus 25:20</a>, suggests that the cherubim were winged bulls, probably with human heads, like those brought from Nineveh. We must not confound them with the four living creatures of Ezekiel's vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm" title="Also out of the middle thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.">Ezekiel 1:5</a>), which are the "beasts" of the Revelation of St. John. The office of the cherub here is to guard the Paradise, lest man should try to force an entrance back; and so too the office of the cherubs upon the mercy-seat was to protect it, lest any one should impiously approach it, except the high-priest on the Day of Atonement. The four living creatures of the Apocalypse have a far different office and signification.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-24 God bid man go out; told him he should no longer occupy and enjoy that garden: but man liked the place, and was unwilling to leave it, therefore God made him go out. This signified the shutting out of him, and all his guilty race, from that communion with God, which was the bliss and glory of paradise. But man was only sent to till the ground out of which he was taken. He was sent to a place of toil, not to a place of torment. Our first parents were shut out from the privileges of their state of innocency, yet they were not left to despair. The way to the tree of life was shut. It was henceforward in vain for him and his to expect righteousness, life, and happiness, by the covenant of works; for the command of that covenant being broken, the curse of it is in full force: we are all undone, if we are judged by that covenant. God revealed this to Adam, not to drive him to despair, but to quicken him to look for life and happiness in the promised Seed, by whom a new and living way into the holiest is laid open for us.</body></html>
