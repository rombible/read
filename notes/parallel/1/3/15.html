Here the curse manifestly outgrows the literal serpent, and refers almost exclusively to the invisible tempter. The hostility commenced between the woman and her destroyer was to be continued by their descendants - the seed of the serpent being those of Eve's posterity who should imbibe the devil's spirit and obey the devil's rule (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>); and the seed of the woman signifying those whose character and life should be of an opposite description, and in particular the Lord Jesus Christ, who is styled by preeminence "the Seed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16, 19</a>), and who came "to destroy the works of the devil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). This we learn from the words which follow, and which, not obscurely, point to a seed which should be individual and personal. <span class="cmt_word">It</span> - or he; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); not <span class="accented">ipsa</span> (Vulgate, Augustine, Ambrose, Gregory the Great; later Romish interpreters understanding the Virgin) - <span class="cmt_word">shall bruise</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Shall crush, trample down - rendering <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> by <span class="accented">torero</span> or <span class="accented">conterere</span> (Vulgate, Syriac, Samaritan, Tuch, Baumgarten, Keil, Kalisch). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Shall pierce, wound, bite - taking the verb as - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, to bite (Furst, Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Shall watch, lie in wait = <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> - Wordsworth suggests as the correct reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">perforo</span>, <span class="accented">vulnero - </span> Gesenius, Knobel). The word occurs only in two other places in Scripture - <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11</a> - and in the latter of these the reading is doubtful (cf. Perowne on Psalm <span class="accented">in loco</span>). Hence the difficulty of deciding with absolute certainty between these rival interpretations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a> appear to sanction the first; the second is favored by the application of the same word to the hostile action of the serpent, which is not treading, but biting; the feebleness of the third is its chief objection. <span class="cmt_word">Thy head</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the superior part of thee (Calvin), meaning that the serpent would be completely destroyed, the head of the reptile being that part of its body in which a wound was most dangerous, and which the creature itself instinctively protects; or the import of the expression may be, He shall attack thee in a bold and manly way (T. Lewis). <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt bruise his heel.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the inferior part (Calvin), implying that in the conflict he would be wounded, but not destroyed; or "the biting of the heel may denote the mean, insidious character of the devil's warfare" (T. Lewis). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14,15 God passes sentence; and he begins where the sin began, with the serpent. The devil's instruments must share in the devil's punishments. Under the cover of the serpent, the devil is sentenced to be degraded and accursed of God; detested and abhorred of all mankind: also to be destroyed and ruined at last by the great Redeemer, signified by the breaking of his head. War is proclaimed between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. It is the fruit of this enmity, that there is a continual warfare between grace and corruption, in the hearts of God's people. Satan, by their corruptions, buffets them, sifts them, and seeks to devour them. Heaven and hell can never be reconciled, nor light and darkness; no more can Satan and a sanctified soul. Also, there is a continual struggle between the wicked and the godly in this world. A gracious promise is here made of Christ, as the Deliverer of fallen man from the power of Satan. Here was the drawn of the gospel day: no sooner was the wound given, than the remedy was provided and revealed. This gracious revelation of a Saviour came unasked, and unlooked for. Without a revelation of mercy, giving some hope of forgiveness, the convinced sinner would sink into despair, and be hardened. By faith in this promise, our first parents, and the patriarchs before the flood, were justified and saved. Notice is given concerning Christ. 1. His incarnation, or coming in the flesh. It speaks great encouragement to sinners, that their Saviour is the Seed of the woman, bone of our bone, Heb 2:11,14. 2. His sufferings and death; pointed at in Satan's bruising his heel, that is, his human nature. And Christ's sufferings are continued in the sufferings of the saints for his name. The devil tempts them, persecutes and slays them; and so bruises the heel of Christ, who is afflicted in their afflictions. But while the heel is bruised on earth, the Head is in heaven. 3. His victory over Satan thereby. Christ baffled Satan's temptations, rescued souls out of his hands. By his death he gave a fatal blow to the devil's kingdom, a wound to the head of this serpent that cannot be healed. As the gospel gains ground, Satan falls.</body></html>
