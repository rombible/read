The outward form of the condemnation is made suitable to the shape which the tempter had assumed; but the true force and meaning, especially in the last and most intense portion of the sentence, belong, not to the animal, but to Satan himself. The serpent is but the type: diabolic agency the reality. First, therefore, the serpent is condemned to crawl. As he is pronounced to be "cursed above (or rather, <span class= "ital">among</span>) all cattle"--that is, the tame animals subjected to man's service--and also "among all beasts of the field"--that is, the wild animals, but a term not applicable to reptiles--it has been supposed that the serpent was originally erect and beautiful, and that Adam had even tamed serpents, and had them in his household. But such a transformation belongs to the region of fable, and the meaning is that henceforward the serpent's crawling motion is to be to it a mark of disgrace, and to Satan a sign of meanness and contempt. He won the victory over our guileless first parents, and still he winds in and out among men, ever bringing degradation with him, and ever sinking with his victims into deeper abysses of shame and infamy. Yet, even so, perpetually he suffers defeat, and has, secondly, to "lick the dust," because his mean devices lead, as in this place, only to the manifestation of God's glory. In the <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost </span>Milton has made Satan a hero, though fallen; really he is a despicable and mean-spirited foe, whose strength lies in man's moral feebleness. Finally, there is perpetual enmity between the serpent and man. The adder in the path bites man's heel, and is crushed beneath his tramp. It has been noticed that in spite of the beauty and gracefulness of many of the species, man's loathing of them is innate; while in hot countries they are his great enemy, the deaths in India, for instance, from snake-bites being many times more than those caused by the carnivora.<p><span class= "bld">Her seed </span>. . . <span class= "bld">shall bruise thy head.</span>--We have here the sum of the whole matter, and the rest of the Bible does but explain the nature of this struggle, the persons who wage it, and the manner and consequences of the victory. Here, too, we learn the end and purpose for which the narrative is cast in its present form. It pictures to us man in a close and loving relation, not to an abstract deity, but to a personal and covenant Jehovah. This Being with tender care plants for him a garden, gathers into it whatever is most rare and beautiful in vegetation, and, having given it to him for his home, even deigns at eventide to walk with him there. In the care of this garden He provides for Adam pleasant employment, and watches the development of his intellect with such interest as a father feels in the mental growth of his child. Day by day He brings new animals within his view; and when, after studying their habits, he gives them names, the Deity shares man's tranquil enjoyment. And when he still feels a void, and needs a companion who can hold with him rational discourse, Jehovah elaborately fashions for him, out of his own self, a second being, whose presence satisfies all his longings. Meanwhile, in accordance with the universal law that hand in hand with free-will goes responsibility, an easy and simple trial is provided for man's obedience. He fails, and henceforward he must wage a sterner conflict, and attain to victory only by effort and suffering. In this struggle man is finally to prevail, but not unscathed. And his triumph is to be gained not by mere human strength, but by the coming of One who is "the Woman's Seed;" and round this promised Deliverer the rest of Scripture groups itself. Leave out these words, and all the inspired teaching which follows would be an ever-widening river without a fountain-head. But necessarily with the fall came the promise of restoration. Grace is no after-thought, but enters the world side by side with sin. Upon this foundation the rest of Holy Scripture is built, till revelation at last reaches its corner-stone in Christ. The outward form of the narrative affords endless subjects for curious discussion; its inner meaning and true object being to lay the broad basis of all future revealed truth.<p>As regards the reading of the Vulgate and some of the Fathers, <span class= "ital">ipsa conteret, </span>"she shall bruise," not only is the pronoun masculine in the Hebrew, but also the verb. This too is the case in the Syriac, in which language also verbs have genders. Most probably a critical edition of the Vulgate would restore even there <span class= "ital">ipse conteret, </span>"he shall bruise."<p>Like a large proportion of the words used in Genesis, the verb is rare, being found only twice elsewhere in Scripture. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm" title="For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.">Job 9:17</a> the meaning seems plainly to be <span class= "ital">to break, </span>but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-11.htm" title="If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.">Psalm 139:11</a>, where, however, J the reading is uncertain, the sense required is <span class= "ital">to cover</span> or <span class= "ital">veil, </span>though Dr. Kay translates <span class= "ital">overwhelm. </span>Some versions in this place translate it <span class= "ital">observe; </span>and the Vulgate gives two renderings, namely, "She shall <span class= "ital">bruise </span>thy head, and thou shalt <span class= "ital">lie in ambush </span>for (his or her) heel" (gender not marked--<span class= "ital">calcaneo ejus</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The translation of the Authorised Version may be depended upon as correct, in spite of its not being altogether applicable to the attack of a natural serpent upon a wayfarer's heel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Confession having thus been made by both delinquents, and the arch-contriver of the whole mischief discovered, the Divine Judge proceeds to deliver sentence. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God said unto the serpent</span>. Which he does not interrogate as he did the man and woman, "because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the animal itself there was no sense of sin, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the devil he would hold out no hope of pardon" (Calvin); "<span class="accented">because</span> the trial has now reached the fountain-head of sin, the purely evil purpose (the demoniacal) having no deeper ground, and requiring no further investigation" (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast done this</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> beguiled the woman. The incidence of this curse has been explained as - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The serpent only (Kalisch). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The devil only (Macdonald). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Partly on the serpent and partly on Satan (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Wholly upon both (Murphy, Bush, Candlish). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The difficulties attending these different interpretations have thus been concisely expressed: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Quidam statuunt maledictioncm latam in serpentem solum, quia hic confertur cum aliis bestiis, non in diabolum, quid is antea maledictus erat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Alii in diabolum solum, quid brutus serpens non poterat juste puniri. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Alii applicant ver. 14 ad serpentem, ver. 15 in diabolum. At vero tu et te idem sunt in utroque versu. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Alii existimant earn in utrumque latam" (Medus in 'Poll Commentsr.,' quoted by Lange). The fourth opinion seems most accordant with the language of the malediction. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art cursed</span>. The cursing of the irrational creature should occasion no more difficulty than the cursing of the earth (ver. 17), or of the fig tree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>). Creatures can be cursed or blessed only in accordance with their natures. The reptile, therefore, being neither a moral nor responsible creature, could not be cursed in the sense of being made susceptible of misery. But it might be cursed in the sense of being deteriorated in its nature, and, as it were, consigned to a lower position in the scale of being. And as the Creator has a perfect right to assign to his creature the specific place it shall occupy, and function it shall subserve, in creation, the remanding of the reptile to an inferior position could not justly be construed into a violation of the principles of right, while it might serve to God's intelligent creatures as a visible symbol of his displeasure against sin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28-36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Above</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">from</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> separate and apart from all cattle (Le Clerc, Von Bohlen, Tuch, Knobel, Keil); and neither <span class="accented">by</span> (Gesenius, De Wette, Baumgarten) nor <span class="accented">above</span> (Luther, A.V., Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch), as if the other creatures were either participators in or the instruments of the serpent's malediction. <span class="cmt_word">All cattle, and above</span> (apart from) <span class="cmt_word">every beast of the field.</span> The words imply the materiality of the reptile and the reality of the curse, so far as it was concerned. <span class="cmt_word">Upon thy belly</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (LXX.); "meaning with, great pain and, difficulty." As Adam s labor and Eve's conception had pain and sorrow added to them (vers. 16, 17), so the serpent's gait" (Ainsworth). <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou go</span>. "As the worm steals over the earth with its length of body," "as a mean and despised crawler in the dust," having previously gone erect (Luther), and been possessed of bone (Josephus), and capable of standing upright and twining itself round the trees (Lange), or at least having undergone some transformation as to external form (Delitzsch, Keil); though the language may import nothing more than that whereas the reptile had exalted itself against man, it was henceforth to be thrust back-into its proper rank," "recalled from its insolent motions to its accustomed mode of going," and "<span class="accented">at</span> the same time condemned to perpetual infamy" (Calvin). As applied to Satan this part of the curse proclaimed his further degradation in the scale of being in consequence of having tempted man. "Than the serpent trailing along the ground, no emblem can more aptly illustrate the character and condition of the apostate spirit who once occupied a place among the angels of God, but has been cast down to the earth, preparatory to his deeper plunge into the fiery lake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; Macdonald). <span class="cmt_word">And dust shalt thou eat</span>, <span class="accented">I.e.</span> mingling dust with all it should eat. "The great scantiness of food on which serpents can subsist gave rise to the belief entertained by many Eastern nations, and referred to in several Biblical allusions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>) - that they cat dust" (Kalisch). More probably it originated in a too literal interpretation of the Mosaic narrative. Applied to the devil, this part of the curse was an additional intimation of his degradation. To "lick the dust" or "eat the dust" "<span class="accented">is</span> equivalent to being reduced to a condition of meanness, shame, and contempt" (Bush); "is indicative of disappointment in all the aims of being" (Murphy); "denotes the highest intensity of a moral condition, of which the feelings of the prodigal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-16.htm">Luke 15:16</a>) may be considered a type' (Macdonald; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the days of thy life</span>. The degradation should be perpetual as well as complete. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14,15 God passes sentence; and he begins where the sin began, with the serpent. The devil's instruments must share in the devil's punishments. Under the cover of the serpent, the devil is sentenced to be degraded and accursed of God; detested and abhorred of all mankind: also to be destroyed and ruined at last by the great Redeemer, signified by the breaking of his head. War is proclaimed between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. It is the fruit of this enmity, that there is a continual warfare between grace and corruption, in the hearts of God's people. Satan, by their corruptions, buffets them, sifts them, and seeks to devour them. Heaven and hell can never be reconciled, nor light and darkness; no more can Satan and a sanctified soul. Also, there is a continual struggle between the wicked and the godly in this world. A gracious promise is here made of Christ, as the Deliverer of fallen man from the power of Satan. Here was the drawn of the gospel day: no sooner was the wound given, than the remedy was provided and revealed. This gracious revelation of a Saviour came unasked, and unlooked for. Without a revelation of mercy, giving some hope of forgiveness, the convinced sinner would sink into despair, and be hardened. By faith in this promise, our first parents, and the patriarchs before the flood, were justified and saved. Notice is given concerning Christ. 1. His incarnation, or coming in the flesh. It speaks great encouragement to sinners, that their Saviour is the Seed of the woman, bone of our bone, Heb 2:11,14. 2. His sufferings and death; pointed at in Satan's bruising his heel, that is, his human nature. And Christ's sufferings are continued in the sufferings of the saints for his name. The devil tempts them, persecutes and slays them; and so bruises the heel of Christ, who is afflicted in their afflictions. But while the heel is bruised on earth, the Head is in heaven. 3. His victory over Satan thereby. Christ baffled Satan's temptations, rescued souls out of his hands. By his death he gave a fatal blow to the devil's kingdom, a wound to the head of this serpent that cannot be healed. As the gospel gains ground, Satan falls.</body></html>
