Not simply of Noah and his sons, but of man in general. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be</span>. Not for the first time, as it could not fail to be evoked by the sin of man during the previous generations, but, having already been developed, it was henceforth to be turned back upon the creature rather than directed against man. <span class="cmt_word">Upon</span>. The verb <span class="accented">to be is</span> first construed with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, and afterwards with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. The LXX. render both by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, though perhaps the latter should be taken as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;</span>, in which case the three clauses of the verse will express a gradation. The dread of man shall first overhang the beasts, then it shall enter into and take possession of them, and finally under its influence they shall fall into man's hand. <span class="cmt_word">Every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in</span>; vide <span class="accented">supra</span>. Murphy translates <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="cmt_word">all that moveth upon the earth, and upon</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">all the fishes of the sea.</span> This does not imply that the animals may not sometimes rise against man and destroy him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-6.htm">Exodus 8:6, 17, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-36.htm">1 Kings 20:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-23.htm">Acts 12:23</a>, for instances in which the creatures were made ministers of Divine justice), but simply that the normal condition of the lower creatures will be one of instinctive dread of man, causing them rather to avoid than to seek his presence - a Statement sufficiently confirmed by the facts that wherever human civilization penetrates, there the dominion of the beasts retires; that even ferocious animals, such as lions, tigers, and other beasts of prey, unless provoked, usually flee from man rather than assail him<span class="cmt_word">. Into your hand are they delivered.</span> Attested by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> man's actual dominion over such of the creatures as are either immediately needful for or helpful to him, such as the horse, the ox, the sheep, etc.; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by man's capability of taming and so reducing to subjection every kind of wild beast - lions, tigers, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-3 The blessing of God is the cause of our doing well. On him we depend, to him we should be thankful. Let us not forget the advantage and pleasure we have from the labour of beasts, and which their flesh affords. Nor ought we to be less thankful for the security we enjoy from the savage and hurtful beasts, through the fear of man which God has fixed deep in them. We see the fulfilment of this promise every day, and on every side. This grant of the animals for food fully warrants the use of them, but not the abuse of them by gluttony, still less by cruelty. We ought not to pain them needlessly whilst they live, nor when we take away their lives.</body></html>
