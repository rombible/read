Though the first mention of wine in Scripture, it is scarcely probable that the natural process of fermentation for so many centuries escaped the notice of the enterprising Cainites, or even of the Sethites; that, "though grapes had been in use before this, wine had not been extracted from them" (Murphy); or that Noah was unacquainted with the nature and effects of this intoxicating liquor (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Keil, Lunge). The article before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> indicates that the patriarch was "familiar with the use and treatment" of the grape (Kalisch); and Moses does not say this was the first occasion on which the patriarch tasted the fermented liquor (Calvin, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And was drunken</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (whence <span class="accented">shechar</span>, strong drink, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>), to drink to the full, very often signifies to make oneself drunken, or simply to be intoxicated as the result of drinking; and that which the Holy Spirit here reprobates is not the partaking of the fruit of the vine, but the drinking so as to be intoxicated thereby. Since the sin of Noah cannot be ascribed to ignorance, it is perhaps right, as well as charitable, to attribute it to ago and inadvertence. Six hundred years old at the time of the Flood, he must have been considerably beyond this when Ham saw him overtaken in his fault, since Canaan was Ham's fourth son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>), and the first was not born till after the exit from the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-18.htm">Genesis 8:18</a>). But from whatever cause induced, the drunkenness of Noah was not entirely guiltless; it was sinful in itself, and led to further shame. <span class="cmt_word">And he was uncovered</span>.

That intoxication tends to sensuality cf. the cases of Lot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-33.htm">Genesis 19:33</a>), Ahasuerus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10, 11</a>), Belshazzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Within his tent</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (LXX.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:18-23 The drunkenness of Noah is recorded in the Bible, with that fairness which is found only in the Scripture, as a case and proof of human weakness and imperfection, even though he may have been surprised into the sin; and to show that the best of men cannot stand upright, unless they depend upon Divine grace, and are upheld thereby. Ham appears to have been a bad man, and probably rejoiced to find his father in an unbecoming situation. It was said of Noah, that he was perfect in his generations, ch.</body></html>
