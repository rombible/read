Literally, <span class="accented">to you it shall be for meat</span>. Though the distinction between unclean and clean animals as to food, afterwards laid clown in the Mosaic code (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-1.htm">Leviticus 11:1-31</a>), is not mentioned here, it does not follow that it was either unknown to the writer or unpracticed by the men before the Flood. <span class="cmt_word">Even as the green herb have I given you all things</span>. An allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a> (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bush); but <span class="accented">vide infra</span>. The relation of this verse to the former has been understood as signifying - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That animal food was expressly prohibited before the Flood, and now for the first time permitted (Mercerus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Candlish, Clarke, Murphy, Jamieson, Wordsworth, Kalisch) - the ground being that such appears the obvious import of the sacred writer s language. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That, though permitted from the first, it was not used till postdiluvian times, when men were explicitly directed to partake of it by God (Theodoret, Chrysostom, Aquinas, Luther, Pererius) - the reason being that prior to the Flood the fruits of the earth were more nutritious and better adapted for the sustenance of man's physical frame, propter excellentem terrae bonitatem praestantemque vim alimenti quod fructus terrae suppeditabant homini, while after it such a change passed upon the vegetable productions of the ground as to render them less capable of supporting the growing feebleness of the body, invalidam ad bene alendum hominem (Petetins). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That whether permitted or not prior to the Flood, it was used, and is here for the first time formally allowed (Keil, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary'); in support of which opinion it may be urged that the general tendency of subsequent Divine legislation, until the fullness of the times, was ever in the direction of concession to the infirmities or necessities of human nature (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>). The opinion, however, which appears to be the best supported is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That animal food was permitted before the fall, and that the grant is h ere expressly renewed (Justin Martyr, Calvin, Willet, Bush, Macdonald, Lange, Quarry). The grounds for this opinion are - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a> does not explicitly forbid the use of animal food. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That science demonstrates the existence of carnivorous animals prior to the appearance of man, and yet vegetable products alone were assigned for their food.' <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That shortly after the fall animals were slain by Divine direction for sacrifice, and probably also for food - at least this latter supposition is by no means an unwarrantable inference from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a> (q.v.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> That the words, "as the green herb," even if they implied the existence of a previous restriction, do not refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>, but to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a>, the green herb in the latter verse being contrasted with the food of man in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>. Solomon Glass thus correctly indicates the connection and the sense: "ut viridem herbam (illis), sic illa omnia dedi vobis" ('Sacr. Phil,' lib. 3. tr. 2, c. 22:2). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> That a sufficient reason for mentioning the grant of animal food in this connection may be found in the subjoined restriction, without assuming the existence of any previous limitation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-3 The blessing of God is the cause of our doing well. On him we depend, to him we should be thankful. Let us not forget the advantage and pleasure we have from the labour of beasts, and which their flesh affords. Nor ought we to be less thankful for the security we enjoy from the savage and hurtful beasts, through the fear of man which God has fixed deep in them. We see the fulfilment of this promise every day, and on every side. This grant of the animals for food fully warrants the use of them, but not the abuse of them by gluttony, still less by cruelty. We ought not to pain them needlessly whilst they live, nor when we take away their lives.</body></html>
