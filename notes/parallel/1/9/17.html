it seems more natural to conclude that from the beginning of the interview (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>) the ark, altar, and worshippers were encircled by its variegated arch. Kalisch compares with the rainbow the other signs which God subsequently appended to his covenants; as, e.g., circumcision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>), the passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>), the sabbath (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 31:13). The Noachic covenant being universal, the sign was also universal - "<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (I1, 11:27), a sign to men of many tongues. The later covenants being limited to Israel, their signs were local and provisional, and have now been supplanted by the higher symbolism of the Christian Church, viz., baptism, the Lord's Supper, and the Christian sabbath. <span class="cmt_word">Which I have established</span>. The different verbs used in this passage in connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> may be here brought together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (ver. 12) representing the covenant as a gift of Divine grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;</span> (Hiph.; vers. 9, 11, 17) exhibiting the covenant as something which God has both caused to stand and raised up when fallen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (ver. 15) depicting the covenant as always present to the Divine mind.

But <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> is used by the Elohist in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-27.htm">Genesis 21:27, 32</a>, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-18.htm">Deuteronomy 4:18</a> the Jehovist uses <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Between ms and all flesh that is upon the earth</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:8-17 As the old world was ruined, to be a monument of justice, so this world remains to this day a monument of mercy. But sin, that drowned the old world, will burn this. Articles of agreement among men are sealed, that what is promised may be the more solemn, and the doing of what is covenanted the more sure to mutual satisfaction. The seal of this covenant was the rainbow, which, it is likely, was seen in the clouds before, but was never a seal of the covenant till now it was made so. The rainbow appears when we have most reason to fear the rain prevailing; God then shows this seal of the promise, that it shall not prevail. The thicker the cloud, the brighter the bow in the cloud. Thus, as threatening afflictions abound, encouraging consolations much more abound. The rainbow is the reflection of the beams of the sun shining upon or through the drops of rain: all the glory of the seals of the covenant are derived from Christ, the Sun of righteousness. And he will shed a glory on the tears of his saints. A bow speaks terror, but this has neither string nor arrow; and a bow alone will do little hurt. It is a bow, but it is directed upward, not toward the earth; for the seals of the covenant were intended to comfort, not to terrify. As God looks upon the bow, that he may remember the covenant, so should we, that we may be mindful of the covenant with faith and thankfulness. Without revelation this gracious assurance could not be known; and without faith it can be of no use to us; and thus it is as to the still greater dangers to which all are exposed, and as to the new covenant with its blessings.</body></html>
