The Authorised Version is probably right in taking <span class= "ital">blood </span>as in apposition to <span class= "ital">soul, </span>which word means here the principle of animation, or that which causes an animal to live. This is God's especial gift; for He alone can bestow upon that aggregation of solids and fluids which we call a body the secret principle of life. Of this hidden life the blood is the representative, and while man is permitted to have the body for his food, as being the mere vessel which contains this life, the gift itself must go back to God, and the blood as its symbol be treated with reverence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, an adverb of limitation or exception, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>, introducing a restriction on the foregoing precept - <span class="cmt_word">flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">with its soul, its blood</span>; the blood being regarded as the seat of the soul, or life principle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), and even as the soul itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>). The idea of the unity of the soul and the blood, on which the prohibition of blood is based, comes to light everywhere in Scripture. In the blood of one mortally wounded his soul flows forth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>), and he who voluntarily sacrifices himself pours out his soul unto death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). The murderer of the innocent slays the soul of the blood of the innocent (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a>), which also cleaves to his (the murderer's) skirts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17</a>, blood of a soul; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>). Nor can it be said to be exclusively peculiar to Holy Scripture. In ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics the hawk, which feeds on bloods, represents the soul. Virgil says of a dying person, "purpuream vomit ille animam" ('AEneid,' 9:349). The Greek philosophers taught that the blood was either the soul (Critias), or the soul s food (Pythagoras), or the soul's seat (Empedocles), or the soul's producing cause (the Stoics); but only Scripture reveals the true relation between them both when it declares the blood to be not the soul absolutely, but the means of its self-attestation (vide Delitzsch s ' Bib. Psychology,' div. 4. sec. 11.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye not eat.</span> Not referring to, although certainly forbidding, the eating of flesh taken from a living animal (Raschi, Cajetan, Delitzsch, Luther, Peele, Jamieson) - a fiendish custom which may have been practiced among the antediluvians, as, according to travelers, it is, or was, among modern Abyssinians; rather interdicting the flesh of slaughtered animals from which the blood has not been properly drained (Calvin, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Wordsworth). The same prohibition (commonly regarded by the Hebrew doctors as the seventh of the Noachic precepts which were enjoined upon all nations; <span class="accented">vide infra</span>, ver. 6) was afterwards incorporated in the Mosaic legislation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16, 23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>), and subsequently imposed upon the Gentile converts in the Christian Church by the authority of the Holy Ghost and the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28, 29</a>). Among other reasons, doubtless, for the original promulgation of this law were these: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A desire to guard against the practice of cruelty to animals (Chrysostom, Calvin, 'Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A design to hedge about human life by showing the inviolability which in God s eye attached to even the lives of the lower creatures (Calvin, Willet, Peele, Kalisch, Murphy). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The intimate connection which even in the animal creation subsisted between the blood and the life (Kurtz, 'Sacr. Worship,' I. A.V.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Its symbolic use as an atonement for sin (Peele, Delitzsch, ' Bib. Psy.' 4:11; Keil, Wordsworth, Murphy). That the restriction continues to the present day may perhaps be argued from its having been given to Noah, but cannot legitimately be inferred from having been imposed on the Gentile converts to Christianity as one <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, from the burden of which they could not be excused (Clarke), as then, by parity of reasoning, meat offered to idols would be equally forbidden, which it is not, except when the consciences of the weak and ignorant are endangered (Calvin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-7 The main reason of forbidding the eating of blood, doubtless was because the shedding of blood in sacrifices was to keep the worshippers in mind of the great atonement; yet it seems intended also to check cruelty, lest men, being used to shed and feed upon the blood of animals, should grow unfeeling to them, and be less shocked at the idea of shedding human blood. Man must not take away his own life. Our lives are God's, and we must only give them up when he pleases. If we in any way hasten our own death, we are accountable to God for it. When God requires the life of a man from him that took it away unjustly, the murderer cannot render that, and therefore must render his own instead. One time or other, in this world or in the next, God will discover murders, and punish those murders which are beyond man's power to punish. But there are those who are ministers of God to protect the innocent, by being a terror to evil-doers, and they must not bear the sword in vain, Ro 13:4. Wilful murder ought always to be punished with death. To this law there is a reason added. Such remains of God's image are still upon fallen man, that he who unjustly kills a man, defaces the image of God, and does dishonour to him.</body></html>
