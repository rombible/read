and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you.">Genesis 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm" title="And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.">Exodus 3:12</a>;

<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-16.htm" title="And it shall be for a token on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.">Exodus 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.">Numbers 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-12.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that you will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token:">Joshua 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm" title="Have you not asked them that go by the way? and do you not know their tokens,">Job 21:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-8.htm" title="They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at your tokens: you make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.">Psalm 65:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm" title="Show me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because you, LORD, have helped me, and comforted me.">Psalm 86:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-9.htm" title="Who sent tokens and wonders into the middle of you, O Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.">Psalm 135:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm" title="That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;">Isaiah 44:25</a>. In the majority of these places the sign, or token, is some natural occurrence, but in its higher meaning it is a proof or indication of God's immediate working. On proper occasions, therefore, it will be supernatural, because the proof of God's direct agency will most fitly be some act such as God alone can accomplish. More frequently it is something natural. Thus the sign to the shepherds of the birth of a Saviour, who was "the anointed Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-11.htm" title="For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.">Luke 2:11</a>), was their finding in a manger a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, a thing of the most simple and ordinary kind. We may dismiss, then, all such curious speculations as that no rain fell before the flood, or that some condition was wanting necessary for producing this glorious symbol. What Noah needed was a guarantee and a memorial which, as often as rain occurred, would bring back to his thoughts the Divine promise; and such a memorial was best taken from the natural accompaniments of rain. We may further notice with Maimonides that the words are not, as in our version, "I do set," but <span class= "ital">my how I have set in the cloud: </span>that is, the bow which God set in the cloud on that day of creation in which He imposed upon air and water those laws which produce this phenomenon, is now to become the sign of a solemn compact made with man by God, whereby He gives man the assurance that neither himself nor his works shall ever again be swept away by a flood.<p>But a covenant is a contract between two parties; and what, we may ask, was the undertaking on man's part? The Talmud enumerates several of the chief moral laws, which it supposes that Noah was now bound to observe. More truly it was a covenant of grace, just as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-18.htm" title="But with you will I establish my covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.">Genesis 6:18</a> was one simply of mercy. What then might have been granted simply as a promise on God's part is made into a covenant, not merely for man's greater assurance, but also to indicate that it was irrevocable. Promises are revocable, and their fulfilment may depend upon man's co-agency; a covenant is irrevocable, and under no circumstances will the earth again be destroyed by water.<p>The rainbow appears in the <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis, </span>but in a heathenish manner:--<p>"From afar the great goddess (Istar) at her approach<p>Lifted up the mighty arches (i.e., the rainbow) which Anu<p>had created as his glory.<p>The crystal of those gods before me (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the rainbow) never<p>may I forget."--<span class= "ital">Chald.

Here the meaning is, that so long as there were circuits or generations of men upon the earth, so long would this covenant endure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:8-17 As the old world was ruined, to be a monument of justice, so this world remains to this day a monument of mercy. But sin, that drowned the old world, will burn this. Articles of agreement among men are sealed, that what is promised may be the more solemn, and the doing of what is covenanted the more sure to mutual satisfaction. The seal of this covenant was the rainbow, which, it is likely, was seen in the clouds before, but was never a seal of the covenant till now it was made so. The rainbow appears when we have most reason to fear the rain prevailing; God then shows this seal of the promise, that it shall not prevail. The thicker the cloud, the brighter the bow in the cloud. Thus, as threatening afflictions abound, encouraging consolations much more abound. The rainbow is the reflection of the beams of the sun shining upon or through the drops of rain: all the glory of the seals of the covenant are derived from Christ, the Sun of righteousness. And he will shed a glory on the tears of his saints. A bow speaks terror, but this has neither string nor arrow; and a bow alone will do little hurt. It is a bow, but it is directed upward, not toward the earth; for the seals of the covenant were intended to comfort, not to terrify. As God looks upon the bow, that he may remember the covenant, so should we, that we may be mindful of the covenant with faith and thankfulness. Without revelation this gracious assurance could not be known; and without faith it can be of no use to us; and thus it is as to the still greater dangers to which all are exposed, and as to the new covenant with its blessings.</body></html>
