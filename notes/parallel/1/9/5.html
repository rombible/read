Perhaps the force of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> may be brought out by rendering, "your blood <span class="accented">to the extent of</span> your lives; ' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not all blood-letting, but that which proceeds to the extent of taking life (cf. ver. 15: "There shall no more be waters <span class="accented">to the extent of</span> a flood"). <span class="cmt_word">Will I require.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">search after</span>, with a view to punishment; hence avenge (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from<span class="cmt_word"></span>) the hand of every beast will I require it. </span> Not "an awful warning against cruelty to the brute creation!" (Clarke), but a solemn proclamation of the sanctity of human life, since it enacted that that beast should be destroyed which slew a man - a statute afterwards incorporated in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28-32</a>), and practiced even in Christian times; "not for any punishment to the beast, which, being under no law, is capable of neither sin nor punishment, but for caution to men" (Peele). If this practice appears absurd to some moderns (Dr. H. Oort, 'The Bible for Young People,' p. 103), it was not so to Solon and Draco, in whose enactments there was a similar provision (Delitzsch, Lunge). <span class="cmt_word">And at</span> (from) <span class="cmt_word">the hand of man</span>; <span class="cmt_word">at</span> (or <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the hand of every man's brother</span>.

The principal objection to discovering Goelism in the phraseology is that it requires <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> to be understood in two different senses, and the circumstance, that the institution of the magistracy appears to be hinted at in the next verse, renders it unnecessary to detect it in this. <span class="cmt_word">Will I require the life</span> (or <span class="accented">soul</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of man.</span> The specific manner in which this inquisition after Blood should be carried out is indicated in the words that follow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-7 The main reason of forbidding the eating of blood, doubtless was because the shedding of blood in sacrifices was to keep the worshippers in mind of the great atonement; yet it seems intended also to check cruelty, lest men, being used to shed and feed upon the blood of animals, should grow unfeeling to them, and be less shocked at the idea of shedding human blood. Man must not take away his own life. Our lives are God's, and we must only give them up when he pleases. If we in any way hasten our own death, we are accountable to God for it. When God requires the life of a man from him that took it away unjustly, the murderer cannot render that, and therefore must render his own instead. One time or other, in this world or in the next, God will discover murders, and punish those murders which are beyond man's power to punish. But there are those who are ministers of God to protect the innocent, by being a terror to evil-doers, and they must not bear the sword in vain, Ro 13:4. Wilful murder ought always to be punished with death. To this law there is a reason added. Such remains of God's image are still upon fallen man, that he who unjustly kills a man, defaces the image of God, and does dishonour to him.</body></html>
