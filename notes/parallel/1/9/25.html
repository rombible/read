In it Ham is passed over in silence, as though his unfilial conduct, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-22.htm" title="And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers without.">Genesis 9:22</a>, made him unworthy of a blessing, while it was not so wicked as to bring on him a curse. The whole weight of Noah's displeasure falls on Canaan, whose degraded position among the nations is thrice insisted upon.<p><span class= "bld">A servant of servants.</span> That is, the most abject of slaves. This was fulfilled in the conquest of Canaau by Joshua, but the race had nevertheless a great future before it. The Hittites were one of the foremost nations of antiquity, and the Sido-nians, Tyrians, and Ph?nicians were such famous traders, that Canaanite is in our version translated <span class= "ital">merchant, </span>without even a note in the margin (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm" title="She makes fine linen, and sells it; and delivers girdles to the merchant.">Proverbs 31:24</a>). But the whole race was enslaved by one of the most terrible and degrading forms of idolatry, and as Shem's blessing is religious, so possibly is Canaan's curse. Lenormant (Manual of Ancient History of the East, 2:219) says of their religion, "No other people ever rivalled them in the mixture of bloodshed and debauchery with which they thought to honour the Deity." He also quotes Creuzer, who says, "The Canaanite religion silenced all the best feelings of human nature, degraded men's minds by a superstition alternately cruel and profligate, and we may seek in vain for any influence for good it could have exercised on the nation."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>. Not in personal resentment, since "the fall of Noah is not at all connected with his prophecy, except as serving to bring out the real character of his children, and to reconcile him to the different destinies which he was to announce as awaiting their respective races" (Candlish); but under the impulse of a prophetic spirit (Poole, Keil, Lange, Candlish, Murphy, and expositors generally), which, however, had its historical occasion in the foregoing incident. The structure of the prophecy is perfectly symmetrical, introducing, in three poetical verses, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the curse of Canaan, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the blessing of Shem, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the enlargement of Japheth, and in all three giving prominence to the doom of servitude pronounced upon the son of Ham. <span class="cmt_word">Cursed</span>. The second curse pronounced upon a human being, the first having been on Cain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>). Colenso notices that all the curses belong to the Jehovistic writer; but <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 49:6, 7, which Tuch and Bleek ascribed to the Elohist, though, doubtless in consequence of the "curse," by Davidson and others it is now assigned to the Jehovist. That this curse was not an imprecation, but a prediction of the future subjection of the Canaanites, has been maintained (Theodoret, Venema, Willet), chiefly in consequence of its falling upon Canaan; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as the contrary "blessing" implies the inheritance of good in virtue of a Divine disposition to that effect, so does "cursing" import subjection to evil by the same Divine power; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if we eliminate the moral element from the doom of Canaan, which clearly referred to a condition of temporal servitude, there seems no reason why the language of Noah should not be regarded as a solemnly pronounced and Divinely guaranteed infliction; while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as the curse is obviously aimed at the nations and peoples descending from the execrated person, it is not inconsistent to suppose that many individuals amongst those nations and peoples might attain to a high degree of temporal and spiritual prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">Be Canaan</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Not Ham, the father of Canaan (Arabic Version); nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> all the sons of Ham, though concentrated in Canaan (Havernick, Keil, Murphy); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Canaan alone, though indirectly, through him, Ham also (Calvin, Bush, Kalisch, Lange, <span class="accented">et alii</span>). For the formal omission of Ham many different reasons have been assigned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Because God had preserved him in the ark (Jewish commentators). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because if Ham had been mentioned all his other sons would have been implicated (Pererius, Lange). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because the sin of Ham was comparatively trifling (Bohlen). For the cursing of Canaan instead of Ham, it has been urged - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That he was Ham's youngest son, as Ham was Noah's (Hoffman and Delitzsch); surely a very insufficient reason for God cursing any one! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That he was the real perpetrator of the crime (Aben Ezra, Procopius, Poole, Jamieson, Lewis, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That thereby the greatness of Ham's sin was evinced (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> That Canaan was already walking in the steps of his father's impiety (Ambrose, Mercerus, Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> That Noah foresaw that the Canaanites would abundantly deserve this visitation (Calvin, Wordsworth, Murphy, Kalisch, Lange). We incline to think the truth lies in the last three reasons. <span class="cmt_word">A servant of servants</span>. A Hebraism for the superlative degree; cf. "King of kings, "holy of holies, "the song of songs" (vide Gesenius, &sect; 119). <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "the last even among servants" (Calvin); "a servant reduced to the lowest degree of bondage and degradation" (Bush); "vilissima servituts pressus" (Sol. Glass); "a most base and vile servant" (Ainsworth); "a working servant" (Chaldee); "the lowest of slaves" (Keil); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), which "conveys the notion of permanent hereditary servitude" (Kalisch). Keil, Hengstenberg, and Wordsworth see an allusion to this condition in the name Canaan (<span class="accented">q</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.<span class="accented">, supra</span>), which, however, Lange doubts. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he be to his brethren</span>. A prophecy which was afterwards abundantly fulfilled, the Canaanites in the time of Joshua having been partly exterminated and partly reduced to the lowest form of slavery by the Israelites who belonged to the family of Shem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-23.htm">Joshua 9:23</a>), those that remained being subsequently reduced by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20, 21</a>); while the Phenicians, along with the Carthaginians and Egyptians, who all belonged to the family of Canaan, were subjected by the Japhetic Persians, Macedonians, and Romans (Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-29 Noah declares a curse on Canaan, the son of Ham; perhaps this grandson of his was more guilty than the rest. A servant of servants, that is, The meanest and most despicable servant, shall he be, even to his brethren. This certainly points at the victories in after-times obtained by Israel over the Canaanites, by which they were put to the sword, or brought to pay tribute. The whole continent of Africa was peopled mostly by the descendants of Ham; and for how many ages have the better parts of that country lain under the dominion of the Romans, then of the Saracens, and now of the Turks! In what wickedness, ignorance, barbarity, slavery, and misery most of the inhabitants live! And of the poor negroes, how many every year are sold and bought, like beasts in the market, and conveyed from one quarter of the world to do the work of beasts in another! But this in no way excuses the covetousness and barbarity of those who enrich themselves with the product of their sweat and blood. God has not commanded us to enslave negroes; and, without doubt, he will severely punish all such cruel wrongs. The fulfilment of this prophecy, which contains almost a history of the world, frees Noah from the suspicion of having uttered it from personal anger. It fully proves that the Holy Spirit took occasion from Ham's offence to reveal his secret purposes. Blessed be the Lord God of Shem. The church should be built up and continued in the posterity of Shem; of him came the Jews, who were, for a great while, the only professing people God had in the world. Christ, who was the Lord God, in his human nature should descend from Shem; for of him, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Noah also blesses Japheth, and, in him, the isles of the gentiles that were peopled by his seed. It speaks of the conversion of the gentiles, and the bringing of them into the church. We may read it, God shall persuade Japheth, and being persuaded, he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. Jews and gentiles shall be united together in the gospel fold; both shall be one in Christ. Noah lived to see two worlds; but being an heir of the righteousness which is by faith, he now rests in hope, waiting to see a better than either.</body></html>
