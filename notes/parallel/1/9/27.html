Jehovah has never been the special name of the Deity worshipped by the race of Japheth, though doubtless it is the Greek <span class= "ital">Zeus </span>and the Latin <span class= "ital">Jove. </span>But it soon became the proper title of God in covenant with the race of Shem. It is plainly impossible to divide this most ancient poem into Elohistic and Jehovistic sections, and the theory, however plausible occasionally, fails in a crucial place like this. Next, there is a play upon the name of Japheth, or rather, <span class= "ital">Yepheth, </span>our translators having made the same mistake as in changing Hebel into Abel. The Hebrew is <span class= "ital">Yapheth Elohim l'Yepheth, </span>"God enlarge the enlarger" (not "God shall enlarge"). While, then, it is the special blessing of Shem that through him the voice of thanksgiving is to ascend to Jehovah, the God of grace; it is Elohim, the God of nature and of the universe, who gives to Japheth wide extension and the most numerous posterity. If the most ancient civilisation and the earliest empires in Egypt and on the Tigris were Hamite, the great world- powers of history, the Chaldean, the Medo-Persian, the Greek and Roman, the Hindoo, were all of Japhetic origin, as are also the modern rulers of mankind.<p><span class= "bld">He shall dwell in the tents of Shem.</span>--(Rather, <span class= "ital">let him dwell</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>In one sense Shem now dwells in the tents of Japheth: for the Jews, the noblest representatives of Shem, dwell dispersed in Aryan countries; and except in the Arabian peninsula, once Cushite, the Shemites have no home of their own. But the religious privileges of their race now belong to the family of Japheth. Carried by Jewish missionaries, like St. Paul, throughout the Roman world, they have become the property of the leading members of the Aryan race; and thus Japheth takes possession of the tents which by right of primogeniture belonged to Shem. For "to dwell in the tents of Shem" is not so much to share them as to own them; and if the Jews retain some degree of faith, it has lost with them all expansive power; while the right interpretation of their Scriptures, and as well the maintenance as the propagation of the religion of their Messiah, are now in the hands of the descendants of Japheth. Yet Shem does not lose all pre-eminence: for again we read--<p><span class= "bld">Canaan shall be his servant (rather, <span class= "ital">their</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span></span>--If Shem lose the foremost place of primogeniture, he is still a brother, and Canaan but a slave.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. <span class="accented">Elohim</span>. If vers. 18-27 are Jehovistic (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), why Elohim? Is this a proof that the Jehovistic document was revised by the Elohistic author, as the presence of Jehovah in any so-called Elohistic section is regarded as an interpolation by the supplementer? To obviate this inference Davidson assigns vers. 20-27 to his redactor. But the change of name is sufficiently explained when we remember that "Jehovah, as such, never was the God of Japheth's descendants, and that the expression would have been as manifestly improper if applied to him as it is in its proper place applied to Shem" (Quarry, p. 393). <span class="cmt_word">Shall enlarge Japheth</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall enlarge or make room for the one that spreads abroad</span>; or, "may God concede an ample space to Japheth" (Gesenius). "Wide let God make it for Japheth" (Keil). "God give enlargement to Japheth" (Lange). So LXX., Vulgate, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic. The words form a paronomasia, both the verb and the noun being connected with the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to spread abroad; Hiph., to cause to lie open, hence to make room for, - and refer to the widespread diffusion and remarkable prosperity of the Japhetic nations. The familiar interpretation which renders "God will persuade Japheth, the persuadable," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> incline his heart by the gospel so that he may dwell in the tents of Shem (Junins, Vatablus, Calvin, Willet, Ainsworth), is discredited by the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the verb never means to persuade, except in a bad sense (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that in this sense it is never followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>, but always by the accusative (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub</span>. <span class="accented">nom</span>.; cf. Bush, p. 109). The fulfillment of the prophecy is apparent from the circumstance that "praeter Europam (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> - wide, extensive) "maximam Asiae pattern, totum demique novum orbem, veluti immensae maguitudinis auctarium, Japheto posterique ejus in perpetuam possessionem obtigisse" (Fuller, ' Sac. Miscel., lib. 2. c. 4, quoted by Glass); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-5</a>, in which Japheth is given as the progenitor of fourteen peoples, to which are added the inhabitants of the lands washed by the sea. The expansive power of Japheth "refem not only to the territory and the multitude of the Japhethites, but also to their intellectual and active faculties. The metaphysics of the Hindoos, the philosophy of the Greeks, the military prowess of the Romans, and the modern science and civilization of the world are due to the race of Japheth" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - not <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (Philo., Theodoret, Onkelos, Dathe, Baumgarten, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), which <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> substantially repeats the blessing already given to Shem, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> would introduce an allusion to the superiority of Shem's blessing in what the context requires should be an unrestricted benediction of Japheth; but <span class="accented">Japheth</span> (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, Keil, Lange, Kaliseh, Murphy, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary') - <span class="cmt_word">shall dwell</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, to dwell; used of God inhabiting the heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>), dwelling in the bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>), residing, or causing his name to dwell, in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>); hence supposed to favor the idea that Elohim is the subject; but it was as Jehovah (not Elohim) that God abode between the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the tents of Shem</span>. Not the tents of celebrity (Gesenius, Vater, Michaelis, De Wette, Knobel), but the tents of the Shemitic races, with allusion not to their subjugation by the Japhethites (Clericus, Von Bohlen, Bochart), which would not be in keeping with the former blessing pronounced upon them (Murphy), but to their subsequent contiguity to, and even commingling with, but especially to their participation in the religious privileges of, the Shemites (the Fathers, Targum Jonathan, Hisronymus, Calvin, Keil, Lange, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Candlish). The fulfillment of the prophecy is too obvious to call for illustration. <span class="cmt_word">And Canaan shall be his servant</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-29 Noah declares a curse on Canaan, the son of Ham; perhaps this grandson of his was more guilty than the rest. A servant of servants, that is, The meanest and most despicable servant, shall he be, even to his brethren. This certainly points at the victories in after-times obtained by Israel over the Canaanites, by which they were put to the sword, or brought to pay tribute. The whole continent of Africa was peopled mostly by the descendants of Ham; and for how many ages have the better parts of that country lain under the dominion of the Romans, then of the Saracens, and now of the Turks! In what wickedness, ignorance, barbarity, slavery, and misery most of the inhabitants live! And of the poor negroes, how many every year are sold and bought, like beasts in the market, and conveyed from one quarter of the world to do the work of beasts in another! But this in no way excuses the covetousness and barbarity of those who enrich themselves with the product of their sweat and blood. God has not commanded us to enslave negroes; and, without doubt, he will severely punish all such cruel wrongs. The fulfilment of this prophecy, which contains almost a history of the world, frees Noah from the suspicion of having uttered it from personal anger. It fully proves that the Holy Spirit took occasion from Ham's offence to reveal his secret purposes. Blessed be the Lord God of Shem. The church should be built up and continued in the posterity of Shem; of him came the Jews, who were, for a great while, the only professing people God had in the world. Christ, who was the Lord God, in his human nature should descend from Shem; for of him, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Noah also blesses Japheth, and, in him, the isles of the gentiles that were peopled by his seed. It speaks of the conversion of the gentiles, and the bringing of them into the church. We may read it, God shall persuade Japheth, and being persuaded, he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. Jews and gentiles shall be united together in the gospel fold; both shall be one in Christ. Noah lived to see two worlds; but being an heir of the righteousness which is by faith, he now rests in hope, waiting to see a better than either.</body></html>
