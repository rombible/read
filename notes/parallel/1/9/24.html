So it is applied to Benjamin in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-34.htm" title="And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that you are no spies, but that you are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and you shall traffic in the land.">Genesis 42:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.">Genesis 43:29</a>, and to David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-11.htm" title="And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come here.">1Samuel 16:11</a>, where the words literally are, <span class= "ital">there re- maineth yet the little one. </span>Now Ham was not the youngest son, but Japheth; and it is not Ham who is cursed, but Canaan. So far from Ham being accursed, his descendants were building mighty cities, such as Egyptian Thebes, Nineveh, and Babylon, were rearing palaces, digging canals, organising governments, and founding empires at a time when the descendants of Japheth were wandering over Europe with no better weapons than implements of flint and bone. The application of the curse to Ham seems to have been suggested to commentators by the degradation of the African race in modern times, and especially by the prevalence of  slavery: but anciently the converse was the case, and for centuries the Egyptians, a Hamite race, made the Israelites serve them.<p>We must not extend, therefore, to Ham the curse pronounced upon Canaan. But what had Canaan done to deserve it? As <span class= "ital">the son, the little one, </span>was not Ham, so certainly it was not Japheth, but probably it was Canaan. He was the youngest son of Ham, and in Hebrew "son" is occasionally used for grandson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-5.htm" title="And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.">Genesis 29:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-55.htm" title="And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.">Genesis 31:55</a>), and so he might be described as Noah's youngest son, being the youngest member of his family. Origen quotes a tradition that Canaan was the first who saw Noah's exposure, and that he told it to his father. Aben Ezra says that Canaan had done worse than mock, though the Scripture does not in words reveal his crime. With some such surmise we must be content; and the meaning seems to be, "Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what (Canaan) his youngest son (or grandson) had done unto him; and it was a deed so shameless that he said, 'Cursed be Canaan.'"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Noah awoke from his wine</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the effects of his wine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-14.htm">1 Samuel 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-37.htm">1 Samuel 25:37</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> (LXX.); "became fully conscious of his condition" (T. Lewis). <span class="cmt_word">And knew</span>. By inspiration (Alford); more probably by making inquiries as to the reason of the simlah covering him. <span class="cmt_word">What his younger son</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">his son, the little one, i.e.</span> the youngest son (Willet, Murphy, Wordsworth, T. Lewis, Alford, Candlish), or the younger son (Keil, Bush, Karisch); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>. Generally believed to have been Ham, though by many Canaan is understood (Aben Ezra, Theodoret, Procopius, Scaliger, Poole, Jamieson, Inglis, Lewis). Origen mentions a tradition that Canaan first saw the shame of Noah, and told it to his father. Wordsworth, following Chrysostom, believes Canaan may have been an accomplice. 'The Speaker's Commentary' thinks it would solve the difficulty which attaches to the cursing of Canaan. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-29 Noah declares a curse on Canaan, the son of Ham; perhaps this grandson of his was more guilty than the rest. A servant of servants, that is, The meanest and most despicable servant, shall he be, even to his brethren. This certainly points at the victories in after-times obtained by Israel over the Canaanites, by which they were put to the sword, or brought to pay tribute. The whole continent of Africa was peopled mostly by the descendants of Ham; and for how many ages have the better parts of that country lain under the dominion of the Romans, then of the Saracens, and now of the Turks! In what wickedness, ignorance, barbarity, slavery, and misery most of the inhabitants live! And of the poor negroes, how many every year are sold and bought, like beasts in the market, and conveyed from one quarter of the world to do the work of beasts in another! But this in no way excuses the covetousness and barbarity of those who enrich themselves with the product of their sweat and blood. God has not commanded us to enslave negroes; and, without doubt, he will severely punish all such cruel wrongs. The fulfilment of this prophecy, which contains almost a history of the world, frees Noah from the suspicion of having uttered it from personal anger. It fully proves that the Holy Spirit took occasion from Ham's offence to reveal his secret purposes. Blessed be the Lord God of Shem. The church should be built up and continued in the posterity of Shem; of him came the Jews, who were, for a great while, the only professing people God had in the world. Christ, who was the Lord God, in his human nature should descend from Shem; for of him, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Noah also blesses Japheth, and, in him, the isles of the gentiles that were peopled by his seed. It speaks of the conversion of the gentiles, and the bringing of them into the church. We may read it, God shall persuade Japheth, and being persuaded, he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. Jews and gentiles shall be united together in the gospel fold; both shall be one in Christ. Noah lived to see two worlds; but being an heir of the righteousness which is by faith, he now rests in hope, waiting to see a better than either.</body></html>
