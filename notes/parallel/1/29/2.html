for it was in the field, the open pasture ground, whereas Rebekah's well was just outside the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-11.htm" title="And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.">Genesis 24:11</a>), and she obtained the water by going down the steps which led to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-16.htm" title="And the damsel was very fair to look on, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.">Genesis 24:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A great stone was upon the well's mouth.</span>--The region round Haran, though fertile, is very dry, and the chief use of the stone was to prevent the well from being choked with sand. As the proper translation is <span class= "ital">the stone upon the well's mouth was great, </span>it would also serve to prevent the well from being used, except at fixed times; for it probably required the strength of two or three men (comp. Robinson, <span class= "ital">Bibl. Res. </span>ii. 180) to remove it; nor does the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.">Genesis 29:10</a> necessarily imply that Jacob rolled it away without the aid of others. Besides this, the stone may have marked that the well was private property: for, as we have seen in the account of the covenants of Abraham and Isaac with Abimelech, no possession was morevalued than that of wells. And as we find the shepherds all waiting for Rachel, and that immediately on her arrival the stone is rolled away, and her sheep watered first, while the rest, though they had been there long before her, yet have to bide their time till her wants are supplied, it is probable that Laban had at least a first claim upon its enjoyment. No such courtesy was shown to the daughters of Jethro (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-17.htm" title="And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.">Exodus 2:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he looked</span> (either to discover where he was, or in search of water), <span class="cmt_word">and behold a well in the field</span>, - not the well at which Eliezer's caravan halted, which was a well for the village maidens, situated in front of the town, and approached by steps (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.), but a well in the open field for the use of flocks, and covered at the time of Jacob's arrival with a huge stone - <span class="cmt_word">and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it.</span> A frequent Oriental scene (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-11.htm">Genesis 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>). "Who that has traveled much in this country has not often arrived at a well in the heat of the day which was surrounded with numerous flocks of sheep waiting to be watered? I once saw such a scene in the burning plains of Northern Syria. Half-naked, fierce-looking men were drawing up water in leather buckets; flock after flock was brought up, watered, and sent away; and after all the men had ended their work, then several women and girls brought up their flocks, and drew water for them. Thus it was with Jethro's daughters; and thus, no doubt, it would have been with Rachel if Jacob had not rolled away the stone and watered her sheep" ('Land and Book,' p. 589). <span class="cmt_word">For out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.</span> "Most of the cisterns are covered with a large thick, flat stone, in the center of which a hole is cut, which forms the mouth of the cistern. This hole, in many instances, we found covered with a heavy stone, to the removal of which two or three men were requisite" (Robinson, 2. p. 180). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-8 Jacob proceeded cheerfully in his journey, after the sweet communion he had with God at Beth-el. Providence brought him to the field where his uncle's flocks were to be watered. What is said of the care of the shepherds for their sheep, may remind us of the tender concern which our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, has for his flock the church; for he is the good Shepherd, that knows his sheep, and is known of them. The stone at the well's mouth was to secure it; water was scarce, it was not there for every one's use: but separate interests should not take us from helping one another. When all the shepherds came together with their flocks, then, like loving neighbours, they watered their flocks together. The law of kindness in the tongue has a commanding power, Pr 31:26. Jacob was civil to these strangers, and he found them civil to him.</body></html>
