Appeased, therefore, by the promise of Rachel as soon as the seven days are over, Jacob, rather than quarrel with the whole family, submits to the wrong. The Hebrew is remarkable, "Fulfil the week of this, and we will give to thee also the this for the service." But in Hebrew <span class= "ital">this </span>. . . <span class= "ital">this </span>means <span class= "ital">the one </span>and <span class= "ital">the other </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-38.htm" title="This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock have I not eaten.">Genesis 31:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-41.htm" title="Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.">Genesis 31:41</a>), and it is a mistake to suppose that the language will allow the first <span class= "ital">this </span>to be understood of any one but Leah, and <span class= "ital">the </span>second <span class= "ital">this </span>of any one but Rachel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fulfill her week</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">make full the week of this otis</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of Leah, if Leah was given to Jacob on the first night of the festivities (Calmer, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, Lange, Ainsworth); but id Leah was married at the close of the seven days, then it must refer to Rachel s week (Bush, Murphy) - <span class="cmt_word">and we</span> (including Laban's wife and eldest son, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50, 55</a>) <span class="cmt_word">will give thee this also</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Rachel) <span class="cmt_word">for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</span> Almost every motive that is mean, base, and despicable appears in this behavior of Laban's; if he attached little value to his daughters' affections, he had a keen appreciation of Jacob's qualities as a shepherd. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:15-30 During the month that Jacob spent as a guest, he was not idle. Wherever we are, it is good to employ ourselves in some useful business. Laban was desirous that Jacob should continue with him. Inferior relations must not be imposed upon; it is our duty to reward them. Jacob made known to Laban the affection he had for his daughter Rachel. And having no wordly goods with which to endow her, he promises seven years' service Love makes long and hard services short and easy; hence we read of the labour of love, Heb 6:10. If we know how to value the happiness of heaven, the sufferings of this present time will be as nothing to us. An age of work will be but as a few days to those that love God, and long for Christ's appearing. Jacob, who had imposed upon his father, is imposed upon by Laban, his father-in-law, by a like deception. Herein, how unrighteous soever Laban was, the Lord was righteous: see Jud 1:7. Even the righteous, if they take a false step, are sometimes thus recompensed in the earth. And many who are not, like Jacob, in their marriage, disappointed in person, soon find themselves, as much to their grief, disappointed in the character. The choice of that relation ought to be made with good advice and thought on both sides. There is reason to believe that Laban's excuse was not true. His way of settling the matter made bad worse. Jacob was drawn into the disquiet of multiplying wives. He could not refuse Rachel, for he had espoused her; still less could he refuse Leah. As yet there was no express command against marrying more than one wife. It was in the patriarchs a sin of ignorance; but it will not justify the like practice now, when God's will is plainly made known by the Divine law, Le 18:18, and more fully since, by our Saviour, that one man and woman only must be joined together, 1Co 7:2.</body></html>
