Concerning this present two remarks must be made; the first, that it proves that though there was not rain enough in Palestine to bring the corn to perfection, yet that there was some small supply, sufficient to maintain a certain amount of vegetation; and but for this Jacob could not have kept his cattle alive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-1.htm" title="Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.">Genesis 47:1</a>). And next, the smallness of the present does not so much show that Jacob had very simple ideas respecting the greatness of the king of Egypt, as that there was a scarcity even of these fruits. Probably the trade in them had ceased, and therefore even a moderate quantity 'would be welcome. For the words rendered balm, spices and myrrh really balsam, gum-tragacanth and ladanum), see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Honey.</span>--As both the honey made by bees and date honey were common in Egypt, many suppose that this was grape-honey, prepared by boiling down the juice of ripe grapes to a third of its original quantity. Hebron is famous for its preparation, and even in modern times three hundred camel loads used to be exported thence annually into Egypt. Diluted with water it forms a very grateful drink, and it is also largely eaten with bread, as we eat butter.<p><span class= "bld">Nuts.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">pistachio nuts, </span>the fruit of the <span class= "ital">pistachio, vera. </span>As the tree delights in dry, rocky situations, it will not grow in Egypt.

It is still imported into Egypt from the district of Hebron. That it was not the honey of bees, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;</span>, (LXX.), meg (Vulgate), is rendered probable by the circumstance that Egypt abounds in this excellent production of nature (vide Michaelis, Suppl., p. 391) - <span class="cmt_word">spices, and myrrh</span> (<span class="accented">wide Genesis</span> 27:25), <span class="cmt_word">nuts</span>, - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, an oblong species of nut, so called from its being fiat on one side and bellying out on the other (the <span class="accented">pistacia</span> <span class="accented">vera</span> of Linnaeus), having an oily kernel which is most palatable to Orientals (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kalisch <span class="accented">in loco</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">and almonds</span>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> or almond tree, so called because of all trees it is the first to arouse from the sleep of winter, the root being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, to be sleepless, (Gesenius), does not seem to have been indigenous in Egypt, while it flourishes in Syria and Palestine (Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-14 Jacob urges his sons to go and buy a little food; now, in time of dearth, a little must suffice. Judah urges that Benjamin should go with them. It is not against the honour and duty children owe their parents, humbly to advise them, and when needful, to reason with them. Jacob saw the necessity of the case, and yielded. His prudence and justice appeared in three things. 1. He sent back the money they had found in the sack. Honesty obliges us to restore not only that which comes to us by our own fault, but that which comes to us by the mistakes of others. Though we get it by oversight, if we keep it when the oversight is discovered, it is kept by deceit. 2. He sent as much again as they took the time before; the price of corn might be risen, or they might have to pay a ransom for Simeon. 3. He sent a present of such things as the land afforded, and as were scarce in Egypt, balm, and honey, etc. Providence dispenses not its gifts to all alike. But honey and spice will never make up the want of bread-corn. The famine was sore in Canaan, yet they had balm and myrrh, etc. We may live well enough upon plain food, without dainties; but we cannot live upon dainties without plain food. Let us thank God that what is most needful and useful, generally is most cheap and common. Though men value very highly their gold and silver, and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits of every land, yet in a time of famine they willingly barter them for bread. And how little will earthly good things stand us in stead in the day of wrath! How ready should we be to renounce them all, as loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Our way to prevail with man is by first prevailing with the Lord in fervent prayer. But, Thy will be done, should close every petition for the mercies of this life, or against the afflictions of this life.</body></html>
