The assertion, therefore, that Benjamin is here represented as a mere boy, is disproved by the use of the word in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">Our little ones.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">our "tafs" </span>that is, our households. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-29.htm" title="And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.">Genesis 34:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me</span> (Benjamin, though styled a lad, must have been at this time upwards of twenty years of age), <span class="cmt_word">and we will arise and go; that we may</span> (literally, and <span class="accented">we shall</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. I will be surety for him</span> (the verb conveys the idea of changing places with another); <span class="cmt_word">of my hand shalt thou require him</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>): <span class="cmt_word">if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee</span>, - the words are even more emphatic than those of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-37.htm">Genesis 42:37</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">then let me bear the blame for ever</span> - literally, and <span class="accented">I shall be a sinner</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> liable to punishment as a sinner) <span class="accented">against the& all the gays</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. of my life). The thought is elliptical. Judah means that if he does not return with Benjamin he shall both have failed in his promise and be guilty of a dire transgression against his father (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-21.htm">1 Kings 1:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time</span> - literally, <span class="accented">these two times</span>. The nobility of character which shines out so conspicuously in Judah's language is afterwards signally illustrated in his pathetic pleading before Joseph, and goes far to countenance the suggestion that a change must have taken place in his inner life since the incidents recorded of him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>, and 38. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-14 Jacob urges his sons to go and buy a little food; now, in time of dearth, a little must suffice. Judah urges that Benjamin should go with them. It is not against the honour and duty children owe their parents, humbly to advise them, and when needful, to reason with them. Jacob saw the necessity of the case, and yielded. His prudence and justice appeared in three things. 1. He sent back the money they had found in the sack. Honesty obliges us to restore not only that which comes to us by our own fault, but that which comes to us by the mistakes of others. Though we get it by oversight, if we keep it when the oversight is discovered, it is kept by deceit. 2. He sent as much again as they took the time before; the price of corn might be risen, or they might have to pay a ransom for Simeon. 3. He sent a present of such things as the land afforded, and as were scarce in Egypt, balm, and honey, etc. Providence dispenses not its gifts to all alike. But honey and spice will never make up the want of bread-corn. The famine was sore in Canaan, yet they had balm and myrrh, etc. We may live well enough upon plain food, without dainties; but we cannot live upon dainties without plain food. Let us thank God that what is most needful and useful, generally is most cheap and common. Though men value very highly their gold and silver, and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits of every land, yet in a time of famine they willingly barter them for bread. And how little will earthly good things stand us in stead in the day of wrath! How ready should we be to renounce them all, as loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Our way to prevail with man is by first prevailing with the Lord in fervent prayer. But, Thy will be done, should close every petition for the mercies of this life, or against the afflictions of this life.</body></html>
