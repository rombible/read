But really this history must be taken as explaining and supplementing the former. Accused of being spies, they would naturally give an account of themselves, and Joseph, anxious to know about his father and brother, would certainly put numerous questions to them concerning their home and family. And they would answer them fully and frankly, little suspecting who was the questioner, and what was his real reason for exacting Benjamin's presence in proof of their trustworthiness:<p><span class= "bld">Of our state and of our kindred.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">concerning ourselves and our birthplace </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm" title="But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.">Genesis 24:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-7.htm" title="The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spoke to me, and that swore to me, saying, To your seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife to my son from there.">Genesis 24:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-3.htm" title="And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you.">Genesis 31:3</a>), that is, our home. Questions about ourselves would be such as those given: "Is your father yet alive? Have ye a brother?" And besides these, Joseph would interrogate them closely concerning the place whence they came, and the state of things there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the famine was sore</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was heavy</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in the land</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. of Canaan). <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> (how long after the return of Joseph's brethren cannot be determined, as the quantity of grain they brought or the number that partook of it cannot possibly be estimated; but it may be reasonably inferred that several months had elapsed since their arrival at Hebron), when they had eaten up - literally, <span class="accented">had finished to eat up, i.e.</span> not nearly (Mercerus, Bush), but entirely consumed - <span class="cmt_word">the corn which they had brought out of Egypt,</span> - it is probable that only Jacob's family partook of the Egyptian corn, the slaves supporting themselves on roots, vegetables, and milk (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gerlach) - <span class="cmt_word">their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</span> What they could buy would be little in proportion to their needs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-14 Jacob urges his sons to go and buy a little food; now, in time of dearth, a little must suffice. Judah urges that Benjamin should go with them. It is not against the honour and duty children owe their parents, humbly to advise them, and when needful, to reason with them. Jacob saw the necessity of the case, and yielded. His prudence and justice appeared in three things. 1. He sent back the money they had found in the sack. Honesty obliges us to restore not only that which comes to us by our own fault, but that which comes to us by the mistakes of others. Though we get it by oversight, if we keep it when the oversight is discovered, it is kept by deceit. 2. He sent as much again as they took the time before; the price of corn might be risen, or they might have to pay a ransom for Simeon. 3. He sent a present of such things as the land afforded, and as were scarce in Egypt, balm, and honey, etc. Providence dispenses not its gifts to all alike. But honey and spice will never make up the want of bread-corn. The famine was sore in Canaan, yet they had balm and myrrh, etc. We may live well enough upon plain food, without dainties; but we cannot live upon dainties without plain food. Let us thank God that what is most needful and useful, generally is most cheap and common. Though men value very highly their gold and silver, and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits of every land, yet in a time of famine they willingly barter them for bread. And how little will earthly good things stand us in stead in the day of wrath! How ready should we be to renounce them all, as loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Our way to prevail with man is by first prevailing with the Lord in fervent prayer. But, Thy will be done, should close every petition for the mercies of this life, or against the afflictions of this life.</body></html>
