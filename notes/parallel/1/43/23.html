(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-18.htm" title="And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:">Genesis 42:18</a>.) The word for "treasure<span class= "ital">" </span>means <span class= "ital">hidden treasure, </span>or as we call it a "windfall." By bringing out Simeon he would remove their worst fears, and so at last they consent to go in.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God</span> (Elohim), <span class="cmt_word">and the God of your father</span>, - an indication that Joseph's steward had been taught to fear and trust the God of the Hebrews (Wordsworth, Murphy) - <span class="cmt_word">hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money</span> (literally, <span class="accented">your money came to</span> me). <span class="cmt_word">And he brought Simeon out unto them.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:15-25 Jacob's sons went down the second time into Egypt to buy corn. If we should ever know what a famine of the word means, let us not think it much to travel as far for spiritual food, as they did for bodily food. Joseph's steward had orders from his master to take them to his house. Even this frightened them. Those that are guilty make the worst of every thing. But the steward encouraged them. It appears, from what he said, that by his good master he was brought to the knowledge of the true God, the God of the Hebrews. Religious servants should take all fit occasions to speak of God and his providence, with reverence and seriousness.</body></html>
