Judah evidently suspended his signet round his neck by a cord; and this custom still exists among the Arabs, of whom some wear signet rings, while others hang them round their necks. Probably each man of distinction had his emblem, and in Genesis 49 Jacob seems to refer to them. Thus Judah's emblem was a lion, Zebulun's a ship, Issachar's an ass, &c.<p><span class= "bld">Thy staff.</span>--The staff in ancient times was elaborately adorned. Herodotus (i. 195) describes the staves carried by the Babylonians, as having on them carvings of fruit, or of some flower or bird; and Homer perpetually makes mention of the "sceptres," that is, walking-sticks, of the kings, as carved so magnificently as to be worthy of being ascribed to Hephaestus, and handed down as emblems of authority from father to son. (See <span class= "ital">Iliad, ii.</span> 101-107.) It is from these staves that the sceptres of kings, and the batons of field-marshals, &c, are derived.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, What pledge shall I give thee?

Its impression was a sign of property and a means of security (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-66.htm">Matthew 27:66</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, etc.). Among the ancient Babylonians it was customary for every one to wear such a ring (Herod., 1:195); and modern Arabians in towns wear a seal-ring on the finger, or fastened by a cord round the neck, the impression of which serves as a signature (Robinson, 1:52). The seals and signets that have been brought to light by the excavations in Assyria and Babylon (Layard, 'Nin. and Bab.,' 152-159, 602-608) are of various forms and materials. They show the art of engraving to have been of great antiquity; but whether Judah's signet was marked with alphabetical characters cannot be determined, though it may have been, since alphabetical writing was as old at least as the time of Abraham (vide Keil, 'Introd.,' Part I. sect. 1. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. &sect; 4) - <span class="cmt_word">and thy bracelets</span> (rather, thy chain, <span class="accented">pithil</span>, ut supra), <span class="cmt_word">and thy staff</span> (the <span class="accented">mateh</span>, or rod, was so called from the idea of stretching out, the root being <span class="accented">natah</span>, to stretch out or extend) <span class="cmt_word">that is in thine hand</span>.

But God will show that his choice is of grace and not of merit, and that Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the chief. Also, that the worthiness of Christ is of himself, and not from his ancestors. How little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast as they did, Joh 8:41. What awful examples the Lord proclaims in his punishments, of his utter displeasure at sin! Let us seek grace from God to avoid every appearance of sin. And let that state of humbleness to which Jesus submitted, when he came to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, in appointing such characters as those here recorded, to be his ancestors, endear the Redeemer to our hearts.</body></html>
