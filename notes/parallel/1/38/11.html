because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.">Genesis 38:26</a>, he acknowledged to be insufficient, wished to evade the duty of giving a third son to Tamar. It does not follow that he blamed her for their deaths; for the loss of two sons in succession might well frighten him. Philippsohn says that it became the rule, that if a woman lost two husbands, the third brother was not bound to marry her, and she was even called <span class= "ital">Katlannith. </span>the murderess. (But see St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-25.htm" title="Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife to his brother:">Matthew 22:25-26</a>, where no such custom is acknowledged.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Judah to Tamer his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow</span> - alma-<span class="accented">nah</span>, from <span class="accented">alam</span>, to be solitary, forsaken, signifies one bereft of a husband, hence a widow (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">at thy father's house</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-13.htm">Leviticus 22:13</a>), <span class="cmt_word">till Shelah my son be grown</span>. It is implied that this was merely a pretext on the part of Judah, and that he did not really intend to give his third son to Tamar, considering her an unlucky woman (Delitzsch, Keil, Kalisch), or, at least, not at present, under the impression that the deaths of Er and Onan had been occasioned by their too early marriages (Lange).

But God will show that his choice is of grace and not of merit, and that Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the chief. Also, that the worthiness of Christ is of himself, and not from his ancestors. How little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast as they did, Joh 8:41. What awful examples the Lord proclaims in his punishments, of his utter displeasure at sin! Let us seek grace from God to avoid every appearance of sin. And let that state of humbleness to which Jesus submitted, when he came to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, in appointing such characters as those here recorded, to be his ancestors, endear the Redeemer to our hearts.</body></html>
