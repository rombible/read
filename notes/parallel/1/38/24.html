In subsequent times, this penalty was limited to one who had married mother and daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm" title="And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.">Leviticus 20:14</a>); or to the daughter of a priest guilty of unchastity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm" title="And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.">Leviticus 21:9</a>). On this account, the Jewish expositors argue that Tamar belonged to a priestly family, and some even think that she was descended from Melchisedek.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it same to pass about three months after</span> (the usual time at which pregnancy is certainly determined), <span class="cmt_word">that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot</span> (or, acted as a <span class="accented">zonah</span>); <span class="cmt_word">and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said</span> (altogether unmindful of his own iniquity three months previous), <span class="cmt_word">Bring her forth, and let her be burnt</span>. Under the law stoning was the punishment allotted to the crime of Tamar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-20.htm">Deuteronomy 22:20-24</a>), burning being added only in cases of excessive criminality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>). It is obvious that the power of life and death lay in the hand of Judah, as the head of his family. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-30 The profligate conduct of Judah and his family. - This chapter gives an account of Judah and his family, and such an account it is, that it seems a wonder that of all Jacob's sons, our Lord should spring out of Judah, Heb 7:14. But God will show that his choice is of grace and not of merit, and that Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the chief. Also, that the worthiness of Christ is of himself, and not from his ancestors. How little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast as they did, Joh 8:41. What awful examples the Lord proclaims in his punishments, of his utter displeasure at sin! Let us seek grace from God to avoid every appearance of sin. And let that state of humbleness to which Jesus submitted, when he came to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, in appointing such characters as those here recorded, to be his ancestors, endear the Redeemer to our hearts.</body></html>
