<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-57.htm" title="Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:57</a>). One was a little to the west of Bethlehem, the other upon the Philistine border, beyond Bethshemesh. As it lay, however, only about seven miles beyond Adullam, and as the flocks there were Judah's private property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-13.htm" title="And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.">Genesis 38:13</a>), and under the charge of Hirah, this remoter place, now called Tibneh, is probably the Timnath meant, as at Bethlehem the pastures were occupied by his father. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm" title="And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.">Genesis 38:14</a>.) For the sheep-shearing, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>. Instead of "his friend Hirah," the LXX. and Vulg. render <span class= "ital">his shepherd Hirah. </span>This would require no change in the consonants, but only in the vowels. Most of the other authorities agree with the Authorised Version; but even so, there was most probably some partnership between Judah and Hirah in these flocks, and they would be under Hirah's charge whenever Judah was absent, tending the flocks of his father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in process of time</span> - <span class="accented">literally, and the days were multiplied</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>), which is rendered by the same words in the A.V. - <span class="cmt_word">the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted</span> (or, comforted himself, ceased to mourn), <span class="cmt_word">and went up unto his sheep-shearers</span> (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>) <span class="cmt_word">to Timnath</span>, - a border town between Ekron and Bethshemesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>) in the plain of Judah (Kalisch, Wordsworth, W.

But God will show that his choice is of grace and not of merit, and that Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the chief. Also, that the worthiness of Christ is of himself, and not from his ancestors. How little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast as they did, Joh 8:41. What awful examples the Lord proclaims in his punishments, of his utter displeasure at sin! Let us seek grace from God to avoid every appearance of sin. And let that state of humbleness to which Jesus submitted, when he came to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, in appointing such characters as those here recorded, to be his ancestors, endear the Redeemer to our hearts.</body></html>
