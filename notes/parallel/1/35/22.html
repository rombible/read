It was the thought of these miseries, following upon his long years of exile, which made Jacob speak so sorrowfully of his experience of life before Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm" title="And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.">Genesis 47:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And Israel heard it.</span>--The Masora notes that some words have here fallen out of the text, which the LXX. fill up by adding, "And it was evil in his sight."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine</span>: - an act of incest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>) for which he was afterwards disinherited (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and Israel heard</span> <span class="cmt_word">it</span>. The hiatus in the text and the break in the MS. at this point may both have been designed to express Jacob's grief at the tidings. The LXX. add feebly <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which surely fails to represent the mingled shame and sorrow, indignation and horror, with which his eldest son's wickedness must have filled him. <span class="cmt_word">Now the sons of Jacob were twelve</span> - a separate verse in the LXX., which is certainly more in accordance with the sense than the division in the text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:21-29 What a sore affliction Reuben's sin was, is shown, and Israel heard it. No more is said, but that is enough. Reuben thought that his father would never hear of it; but those that promise themselves secrecy in sin, are generally disappointed. The age and death of Isaac are recorded, though he died not till after Joseph was sold into Egypt. Isaac lived about forty years after he had made his will, chap. 27:2. We shall not die an hour the sooner, but much the better, for timely setting our hearts and houses in order. Particular notice is taken of the agreement of Esau and Jacob at their father's funeral, to show how God had wonderfully changed Esau's mind. It is awful to behold relations, sometimes for a little of this world's goods, disputing over the graves of their friends, while they are near going to the grave themselves.</body></html>
