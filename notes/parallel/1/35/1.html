for though the first result of the high-handed proceeding of Simeon and Levi was to strike the natives with terror (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-5.htm" title="And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.">Genesis 35:5</a>), yet reprisals might follow if they had time to learn the comparatively small number of Jacob's followers. It was necessary, therefore, to remove; but besides this, Beth-el was the goal of the patriarch's jonrneyings. He had made a solemn vow there on his journey to Padanaram, and though forty-two years had elapsed, it had not been forgotten (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-13.htm" title="I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.">Genesis 31:13</a>); and the Divine command to go thither Was the outward authorisation of what his own conscience dictated. On this account we cannot believe that he had remained long at Shechem. Nomads are singularly leisurely in their movements. There is nothing of the rush and hurry of city life in their doings or purposes. They are capable of a great effort occasionally, but then relapse into their usual slowness. And so, when Jacob found good pasture and plenty of room for his cattle at Shechem, he remained there for awhile; but he did not abandon his purpose of going first <span class= "ital">to </span>Beth-el, and finally to Hebron.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God</span> - Elohim. The employment of this name for the Deity throughout the present chapter has been deemed conclusive evidence that, with Rome Jehovistic alterations, it belongs to the fundamental document (Tuch, Bleek, Delitzsch, Kalisch, <span class="accented">et alii</span>); but the frequent allusions to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-16</a>, which by partitionists is almost universally assigned to the Jehovist, prove that both sections have proceeded from the same author, and that, "though the mention of the name is avoided, this chapter, there is no doubt, substantially relates to Jehovah" (Hengstenberg), while the name Elohim may simply indicate that Jacob s journey from Shechem was undertaken in obedience to a Divine intimation (Quarry) - <span class="cmt_word">said unto Jacob</span> (shortly after the incidents recorded in the preceding chapter), <span class="cmt_word">Arise, go up to Bethel</span>, - about thirty miles distant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), to which, some thirty years previous, he had solemnly vowed to return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>) - a vow which he appeared somewhat dilatory in performing, although its conditions had been exactly fulfilled (Keil, Kurtz, Kalisch, etc.) - <span class="cmt_word">and dwell there</span> (the massacre of the Shechemites had obviously rendered longer residence in that neighborhood unsafe): <span class="cmt_word">and make there an altar</span> - this Jacob had substantially promised to do in his vow (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">unto God, that appeared unto thee</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unto Jehovah (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 28:13) - <span class="cmt_word">when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother</span>. The words contained an assurance that the same Divine arm which had shielded him against the enmity of Esau and the oppression of Laban would extend to him protection on his future way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-5 Beth-el was forgotten. But as many as God loves, he will remind of neglected duties, one way or other, by conscience or by providences. When we have vowed a vow to God, it is best not to defer the payment of it; yet better late than never. Jacob commanded his household to prepare, not only for the journey and removal, but for religious services. Masters of families should use their authority to keep up religion in their families, Jos 24:15. They must put away strange gods. In families where there is a face of religion, and an altar to God, yet many times there is much amiss, and more strange gods than one would suppose. They must be clean, and change their garments. These were but outward ceremonies, signifying the purifying and change of the heart. What are clean clothes, and new clothes, without a clean heart, and a new heart? If Jacob had called for these idols sooner, they had parted with them sooner. Sometimes attempts for reformation succeed better than we could have thought. Jacob buried their images. We must be wholly separated from our sins, as we are from those that are dead and buried out of sight. He removed from Shechem to Beth-el. Though the Canaanites were very angry against the sons of Jacob for their barbarous usage of the Shechemites, yet they were so kept back by Divine power, that they could not take the opportunity now offered to avenge them. The way of duty is the way of safety. When we are about God's work, we are under special protection; God is with us, while we are with him; and if He be for us, who can be against us? God governs the world more by secret terrors on men's minds than we are aware of.</body></html>
