At Beth-el Jacob, when going forth, had seen the dream which assured him of Divine protection; at Beth-el, on his return, God renews the covenant, confirms to him the name of Israel, and transfers to him the promises of a numerous seed and of the possession of the land. It was the ratification to him of the inheritance of all the hopes and assurances given to Abraham.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God appeared unto Jacob again</span>, - this was a visible manifestation, m contrast to the audible one in Shechem (ver. 1), and in a state of wakefulness (ver. 13), as distinguished from the dream vision formerly beheld at Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">when he came</span> (or had come) <span class="cmt_word">out of Padan-aram</span> (as previously he had appeared to the patriarch on going into Padan-aram), <span class="cmt_word">and blessed him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> renewed the promises of the covenant, of which he was the heir. <span class="cmt_word">And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob</span>: - or Supplanter (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>).

Cf. the twice-given name of Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16-19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:6-15 The comfort the saints have in holy ordinances, is not so much from Beth-el, the house of God, as from El-beth-el, the God of the house. The ordinances are empty things, if we do not meet with God in them. There Jacob buried Deborah, Rebekah's nurse. She died much lamented. Old servants in a family, that have in their time been faithful and useful, ought to be respected. God appeared to Jacob. He renewed the covenant with him. I am God Almighty, God all-sufficient, able to make good the promise in due time, and to support thee and provide for thee in the mean time. Two things are promised; that he should be the father of a great nation, and that he should be the master of a good land. These two promises had a spiritual signification, which Jacob had some notion of, though not so clear and distinct as we now have. Christ is the promised Seed, and heaven is the promised land; the former is the foundation, and the latter the top-stone, of all God's favours.</body></html>
