Besides these, the numerous men and women who formed the<span class= "ital">"tafs</span>" of the Shechemites were certainly worshippers of false deities. The object, then, of this reformation was not merely to raise Jacob's own family to a higher spiritual state, but also to initiate the many heathen belonging to their households into the true religion. Outward rites of purification and changes of garment were to accompany the religious teaching given, because of their symbolical value; and we can well believe that much deep and earnest religious feeling would be evoked by the solemnities which accompanied this drawing near of the whole tribe to God. This reformation is also interesting as being the first of a long series of such acts constantly recurring in the history of Israel; and especially it is parallel to the sanctification of the people at Sinai. There, also, there was the initiation not merely of the lineal Israel, but also of the mixed multitude, into the true religion--for Jacob's family had then grown into a nation; and there, also, symbolical washings were enjoined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/19-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,">Exodus 19:10-14</a>). These subsequently were still practised under the Law, and grew into the baptism by which we are now admitted into the Church of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jacob said unto his household</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> those more immediately belonging to his family), <span class="cmt_word">and to all that were with him</span> (referring probably to the captured Shechemites), <span class="cmt_word">Put away the strange gods</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the gods of the stranger</span>, including most likely the teraphim of Laban, which Rachel still retained, and other objects of idolatrous worship, either brought by Jacob's servants from Mesopotamia, or adopted in Canaan, or perhaps possessed by the captives - <span class="cmt_word">that are among you, and be clean,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">cleanse yourselves</span>. The word is that which afterwards describes the purifications of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13</a>). Aben Ezra interprets it as meaning that they washed their bodies; and Michaelis views the rite as a kind of baptism, signifying their adoption of the true religion of Jehovah - a quasi baptism of repentance, like that afterwards preached by John (vide 'Suppl.,' p. 1000) - <span class="cmt_word">and change your garments</span>. The directions here given are very similar to those which were subsequently issued at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>), and were meant to symbolize a moral and spiritual purification of the mind and heart. <span class="cmt_word">And let us arise, and go to Bethel</span>. "This is obviously not the first time Jacob acquainted his family with the vision at Bethel (Inglis). <span class="cmt_word">And I will make there an altar unto God,</span> - El is probably employed because of its proximity to and connection with Bethel, or house of El, and the intended contrast between the El of Bethel and the strange Elohim which Jacob's household were commanded to put away (cf. Quarry, p. 512) - <span class="cmt_word">who answered me in the day of my distress</span>, - this seems to imply that Jacob prayed at Bethel before he slept, if it does not refer to his supplication before meeting, Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and was with me in the way which I went.</span> This language clearly looks back to Bethel (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-5 Beth-el was forgotten. But as many as God loves, he will remind of neglected duties, one way or other, by conscience or by providences. When we have vowed a vow to God, it is best not to defer the payment of it; yet better late than never. Jacob commanded his household to prepare, not only for the journey and removal, but for religious services. Masters of families should use their authority to keep up religion in their families, Jos 24:15. They must put away strange gods. In families where there is a face of religion, and an altar to God, yet many times there is much amiss, and more strange gods than one would suppose. They must be clean, and change their garments. These were but outward ceremonies, signifying the purifying and change of the heart. What are clean clothes, and new clothes, without a clean heart, and a new heart? If Jacob had called for these idols sooner, they had parted with them sooner. Sometimes attempts for reformation succeed better than we could have thought. Jacob buried their images. We must be wholly separated from our sins, as we are from those that are dead and buried out of sight. He removed from Shechem to Beth-el. Though the Canaanites were very angry against the sons of Jacob for their barbarous usage of the Shechemites, yet they were so kept back by Divine power, that they could not take the opportunity now offered to avenge them. The way of duty is the way of safety. When we are about God's work, we are under special protection; God is with us, while we are with him; and if He be for us, who can be against us? God governs the world more by secret terrors on men's minds than we are aware of.</body></html>
