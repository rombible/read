As agriculture was only beginning to be practised in Canaan, this threshing. floor would be common property, situated in some place easy of access, and probably a village would grow up near it.<p><span class= "bld">Beyond Jordan.</span>--It is disputed whether this means on the east or on the west of the Jordan. It is certain that the route taken by Joseph lay to the east of the Dead Sea; for Goren-Atad is placed by Jerome at Beth-Hoglah, which lay between the Jordan and Jericho, and Joseph could have gone thither only by travelling through the territories of Moab and Amnion. This may seem a long detour, but, as may be seen in the Excursus on the Expedition of Chedorlaomer, the route through the wilderness of Judah was very difficult; and though the western shore of <span class= "ital">the </span>Dead Sea was practicable as far as Engedi, it was necessary there to ascend a mountain-path so steep that a few Amorites might have guarded it against any number of invaders; and probably it was absolutely impracticable for chariots. It would have been easy, however, to reach Hebron through the Philistine country; but it is remarkable that we find hostilities going on between the descendants of Joseph and the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-21.htm" title="And Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came down to take away their cattle.">1Chronicles 7:21</a>); and if raids were of common occurrence between the Semitic clans in Goshen and the Philistines, Joseph would not expose his father's remains to the danger of an attack. Possibly they may even have refused their consent, and hence the attack upon them by Ephraim's sons. On the other hand, the sons of Esau would show great respect to the body of their uncle--(Jewish tradition makes even the sons of Ishmael and of Keturah take part in the mourning)--and moreover they had not yet attained to any great power; and we gather from Esau's march through the lands on the west of the Dead Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm" title="And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.">Genesis 32:6</a>) that the natives there were too few and feeble to resist the chariots and horsemen which formed the escort. While therefore "beyond Jordan" would naturally mean "on the east of Jordan," it may here express the fact that Joseph had just crossed the Jordan when the lamentation was made. The only other tenable explanation is that Goren-Atad was really on the eastern bank of the Jordan, and that though Beth-Hoglah was the nearest village, the two were not identical. It would be natural to make the solemn seven days' mourning, either when just about to enter the Canaanite territory or at the tomb.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad.</span> The threshing-floor, or <span class="accented">goren</span>, was a large open circular area which was used for trampling out the corn by means of oxen, and was exceedingly convenient for the accommodation of a large body of people such as accompanied Joseph. The goren at which the funeral party halted was named Atad (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Buckthorn), either from the name of the owner, or from the quantity of buck-thorn which grew in the neighborhood. <span class="cmt_word">Which is beyond Jordan</span> - literally, <span class="accented">on</span> the <span class="accented">other side of the Jordan, i.e.</span> west side, if the narrator wrote from his own standpoint (Jerome, Drusius, Ainsworth, Kalisch, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Wordsworth, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), in which case the funeral train would in all probability follow the direct route through the country of the Philistines, and Goren Atad would be situated somewhere south of Hebron, in the territory (afterwards) of Judah; but east side of the river if the phrase must be interpreted from the standpoint of Palestine (Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Keil, Lange, Gerlach, Havernick, Murphy, and others), in which case the burial procession must have journeyed by the wilderness, as the Israelites on a latter occasion did, and probably for not dissimilar reasons. In favor of the former interpretation may be claimed ver. 11, which says the Canaanites beheld the mourning, implying seemingly that it occurred within the borders of Canaan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the west of the Jordan; while support for the latter is derived from ver. 13, which appears to state that after the lamentation at Goren Atad the sons of Jacob carried him into Canaan, almost necessarily involving the inference that Goren Atad was on the east of the Jordan; but <span class="accented">vide infra</span>. If the former is correct, Goren Atad was probably the place which Jerome calls Betagla <span class="accented">tertio ab Hiericho lapide, duobus millibus ab Jordane</span>; if the latter is correct, it does not prove a post-Mosaic authorship (Tuch, Bohlen, etc.), since the phrase appears to have had an ideal usage with reference to Canaan in addition to the objective geographical one (Hengstenberg 'On the Genuineness of the Pentateuch,' vol. 2. p. 260; Keil's 'Introduction,' vol. 1. p. 189; Kalisch 'On Genesis,' p. 776). <span class="cmt_word">And there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.</span> The Egyptians were exceedingly demonstrative and vehement in their public lamentations for the dead, rending their garments, smiting on their breasts, throwing dust and mud on their heads, calling on the deceased by name, and chanting funeral dirges to the music of a tambourine with the tinkling plates removed (Wilkinson's 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 440, ed. 1878). <span class="cmt_word">And he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span> This was a special mourning before interment (cf. Ecclus. 22:11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:7-14 Jacob's body was attended, not only by his own family, but by the great men of Egypt. Now that they were better acquainted with the Hebrews, they began to respect them. Professors of religion should endeavour by wisdom and love to remove the prejudices many have against them. Standers-by took notice of it as a grievous mourning. The death of good men is a loss to any place, and ought to be greatly lamented.</body></html>
