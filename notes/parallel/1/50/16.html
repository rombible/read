It is, however, probable, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm" title="O my soul, come not you into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not you united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they dig down a wall.">Genesis 49:6</a>, that Jacob not only knew of it, but saw in Simeon and Levi the chief offenders. But besides the father's authority the message brings a twofold influence to bear upon Joseph: for first it reminds him that they were his brethren, and next, that they shared the same religious faith--no slight band of union in a country where the religion was so unlike their own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (under these erroneous though not unnatural apprehensions) <span class="cmt_word">they sent a messenger unto Joseph</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">they charged Joseph, i.e.</span> they deputed one of their number (possibly Benjamin) to carry their desires to Joseph - <span class="cmt_word">saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying</span> (though not recorded, the circumstance here mentioned may have been historically true), <span class="cmt_word">So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil</span> (nothing is more inherently probable than that the good man on his death-bed did request his sons to beg their brother's pardon): <span class="cmt_word">and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father</span>. Joseph's brethren in these words at once evince the depth of their humility, the sincerity of their repentance, and the genuineness of their religion. They were God's true servants, and they wished to be forgiven by their much-offended brother, who, however, had long since embraced them in the arms of his affection. <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph wept when they spake unto him</span> - pained that they should for a single moment have enter-rained such suspicions against his love. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:15-21 Various motives might cause the sons of Jacob to continue in Egypt, notwithstanding the prophetic vision Abraham had of their bondage there. Judging of Joseph from the general temper of human nature, they thought he would now avenge himself on those who hated and injured him without cause. Not being able to resist, or to flee away, they attempted to soften him by humbling themselves. They pleaded with him as the servants of Jacob's God. Joseph was much affected at seeing this complete fulfilment of his dreams. He directs them not to fear him, but to fear God; to humble themselves before the Lord, and to seek the Divine forgiveness. He assures them of his own kindness to them. See what an excellent spirit Joseph was of, and learn of him to render good for evil. He comforted them, and, to banish all their fears, he spake kindly to them. Broken spirits must be bound up and encouraged. Those we love and forgive, we must not only do well for, but speak kindly to.</body></html>
