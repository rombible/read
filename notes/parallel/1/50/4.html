It has been suggested (Kalisch) that Joseph's power may have been restricted after the expiration of the famine, or that another Pharaoh may have succeeded to the throne who was not so friendly as his predecessor with the grand vizier of the realm; but such conjectures are not required to render Joseph's conduct in this matter perfectly intelligible - <span class="cmt_word">saying, My father made me swear</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29</a>), <span class="cmt_word">saying</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my father saying), <span class="cmt_word">Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me</span> - not bought (Onkelos, Drusius, Ainsworth, Bohlen, and others), but digged, <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">fodi</span> (Vulgate).

Grace does not destroy, but it purifies, moderates, and regulates natural affection. The departed soul is out of the reach of any tokens of our affection; but it is proper to show respect to the body, of which we look for a glorious and joyful resurrection, whatever may become of its remains in this world. Thus Joseph showed his faith in God, and love to his father. He ordered the body to be embalmed, or wrapped up with spices, to preserve it. See how vile our bodies are, when the soul has forsaken them; they will in a very little time become noisome, and offensive.</body></html>
