As for his brethren, he had probably as yet no settled purpose, but naturally he would feel great indignation at the treatment he had experienced at their hands, and might not be unwilling to give them some degree of punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph said unto them</span> (betraying his excitement in his language), <span class="cmt_word">That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies</span>. But Joseph knew by this time that they were not spies.

Not seeing his brother Benjamin, he suspected that they had made away with him, and he gave them occasion to speak of their father and brother. God, in his providence, sometimes seems harsh with those he loves, and speaks roughly to those for whom yet he has great mercy in store. Joseph settled at last, that one of them should be left, and the rest go home and fetch Benjamin. It was a very encouraging word he said to them, I fear God; as if he had said, You may be assured I will do you no wrong; I dare not, for I know there is one higher than I. With those that fear God, we may expect fair dealing.</body></html>
