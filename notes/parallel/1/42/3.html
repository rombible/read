We learn, however, that they still possessed flocks and herds when they went down into Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-1.htm" title="Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.">Genesis 47:1</a>), and also households of servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-5.htm" title="And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.">Genesis 46:5</a>, where see Note). Joseph, moreover, besides the wagons and their contents, sends twenty loads of provisions for the use of his father by the way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/45-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.">Genesis 45:21-23</a>), showing thereby that there were very many mouths to feed. Probably, therefore, there was some small amount of rain in Palestine, though not enough for the support of crops of corn. There would be, however, supplies of milk and flesh, but not much more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph's ten brethren went down</span> - either it was for safety that all the ten went, or because, the corn being sold to individuals, the quantity received would depend on their numbers (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">to buy corn</span> - the word for corn, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, if not a primitive, like the Latin <span class="accented">far</span> (Furst), may be derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to separate, sever, choose out, hence purify (Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Gesenius), and may describe grain as that which has been cleaned from chaff, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a> - <span class="cmt_word">in</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> corn to be brought from) <span class="cmt_word">Egypt</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-6 Jacob saw the corn his neighbours had bought in Egypt, and brought home. It is a spur to exertion to see others supplied. Shall others get food for their souls, and shall we starve while it is to be had? Having discovered where help is to be had, we should apply for it without delay, without shrinking from labour, or grudging expense, especially as regards our never-dying souls. There is provision in Christ; but we must come to him, and seek it from him.</body></html>
