It is quite possible that on a route frequented by numerous caravans there were places where a certain amount of protection for the beasts of burden and their attendants had been provided, either by the rulers, or by benevolent people. But Joseph's brethren would find there at most only walls and water. "The one" who opened his sack is said by tradition to have been Levi. At the end of the verse this sack is called by another name, signifying a travelling-bag, or wallet for forage. The translation of these three different words, vessel, wallet, and sack, indifferently by the last of them, has led to the absurd view, common among commentators, that Joseph's brethren went down into Egypt, each with one ass and one sack. Hence their astonishment that such an insignificant knot of men should be brought before the governor of Egypt. But the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-25.htm" title="Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.">Genesis 42:25</a> signifies everything into which corn could be put; and the word at the end of this verse is the travelling-bag, which each of the patriarchs carried behind him on his riding ass. Their men would go on foot at the side of the beasts of burden laden with the corn.<p>It is said here that one only found his money at the lodging-place, and that the rest did not find their money until they emptied their sacks on reaching home. the sacks mentioned here (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-35.htm" title="And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.">Genesis 42:35</a>) were the same as the travelling-bags, for they are expressly so called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/43-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.">Genesis 43:21-23</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.">Genesis 43:21</a>, however, they tell Joseph's steward that they all found their money in the mouth of their sacks on opening them at the lodging-place. This was not strictly accurate, but it would have been wearisome and useless to enter into such details. Two things it was necessary to show: the first, that all had found their money; the second, that they had gone too far on their journey homewards to be able to return and give the money back. Probably what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.">Genesis 43:21</a> was literally true only of one, and he found his money because it had been put in last, and was therefore at the mouth of the wallet. In all the other sacks it had been put in first, under the corn, and so they did not find it until "they had emptied their sacks."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as one of them opened his sack</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and the one opened his sack, i.e.</span> they did not all open their sacks on the homeward journey, although afterwards, in reporting the circumstance to Joseph, they represent themselves as having done so (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-21.htm">Genesis 43:21</a>); but only one at the wayside inn, and the rest on reaching home (ver. 35; <span class="accented">vide infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-21.htm">Genesis 43:21</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to give his ass provender in the inn</span> (the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, an inn to pass the night, was not in the modern sense of the term, but simply a halting-place or camping station where travelers were wont to lodge, without finding for themselves or animals any other food than they carried with them), <span class="cmt_word">he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth</span> - literally, <span class="accented">in the opening, of his amtachath</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, to spread out, an old word for a sack (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-18.htm">Genesis 43:18, 21, 22</a>), here used synonymously with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, from which it would seem that the travelers carried two sorts of bags, one for the corn <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (ver. 25), and another for the called asses' provender called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. It was in the latter that the money had been placed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:25-28 The brethren came for corn, and corn they had: not only so, but every man had his money given back. Thus Christ, like Joseph, gives out supplies without money and without price. The poorest are invited to buy. But guilty consciences are apt to take good providences in a bad sense; to put wrong meanings even upon things that make for them.</body></html>
