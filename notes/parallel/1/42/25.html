But Joseph could not have meant thus to alarm them, as their fear would act as an obstacle to their coming again accompanied by Benjamin. It is more likely that he intended it as an encouragement, and sign of secret good will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">Joseph commanded to fill</span> - literally, <span class="accented">commanded, and they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Joseph's men) <span class="accented">filled - <span class="cmt_word"></span>their sacks</span> (rather, vessels or receptacles, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">with corn, and to restore every man's money</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the</span>. <span class="accented">dr pieces of silver, each</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into his sack</span>, - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, <span class="accented">saccus</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, sack (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 37:34).
