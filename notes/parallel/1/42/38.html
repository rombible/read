Always of a timid and affection Ate disposition, he looks onward now without hope, and sees in the future only dangers and ill-fortune. Probably by this time he had lost Leah as well as Rachel, but the blow that had struck him utterly down had evidently been the loss of Joseph, in whom Rachel had still seemed to live on for him. And therefore now he clung the more warmly to Benjamin, and it is plain that the father's deep sorrow for the loss of the petted son had softened the hearts of his brethren. They have no grudge against Benjamin because he has taken Joseph's place, but rather seem to share in their father's feelings, and their hearts were in accordance with what Judah says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/44-18.htm" title="Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant: for you are even as Pharaoh.">Genesis 44:18-34</a>, that any personal suffering would be cheerfully borne by them, rather than to have to undergo the sight of the repetition of such grief as they previously had themselves inflicted.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jacob) <span class="cmt_word">said, My son shall not go down with you;</span> - not because he could not trust Reuben after the sin described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a> (Wordsworth), or because he could not assent to Reuben's proposal (Ainsworth), but because of what is next stated - <span class="cmt_word">for his brother</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the same mother, viz., Joseph) <span class="cmt_word">is dead</span> (cf. ver. 13; 37:33; 44:28), <span class="cmt_word">and he is left alone</span>: - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he alone (of Rachel's children) is left as a survivor - <span class="cmt_word">if mischief befall him</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and mischief shall befall him</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and ye shall</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave</span> - Sheol (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:29-38 Here is the report Jacob's sons made to their father. It troubled the good man. Even the bundles of money Joseph returned, in kindness, to his father, frightened him. He laid the fault upon his sons; knowing them, he feared they had provoked the Egyptians, and wrongfully brought home their money. Jacob plainly distrusted his sons, remembering that he never saw Joseph since he had been with them. It is bad with a family, when children behave so ill that their parents know not how to trust them. Jacob gives up Joseph for gone, and Simeon and Benjamin as in danger; and concludes, All these things are against me. It proved otherwise, that all these things were for him, were working together for his good, and the good of his family. We often think that to be against us, which is really for us. We are afflicted in body, estate, name, and in our relations; and think all these things are against us, whereas they are really working for us a weight of glory. Thus does the Lord Jesus conceal himself and his favour, thus he rebukes and chastens those for whom he has purposes of love. By sharp corrections and humbling convictions he will break the stoutness and mar the pride of the heart, and bring to true repentance. Yet before sinners fully know him, or taste that he is gracious, he consults their good, and sustains their souls, to wait for him. May we do thus, never yielding to discouragement, determining to seek no other refuge, and humbling ourselves more and more under his mighty hand. In due time he will answer our petitions, and do for us more than we can expect.</body></html>
