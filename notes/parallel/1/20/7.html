It is therefore rightly joined with the words "He shall pray for thee." For the word prophet is used here in its old sense of <span class= "ital">spokesman </span>(comp. Exod. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-16.htm" title="And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelled in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.">Genesis 4:16</a>), and especially of such an one as mediates between God and man. There was a true feeling that God in His own nature is beyond the reach of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/9-32.htm" title="For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.">Job 9:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm" title="O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his neighbor!">Job 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1Timothy 6:16</a>); and this in heathen nations led to men peopling their heavens with a multitude of minor deities. In Israel, after the founding of the prophetic schools by Samuel, the prophets became an order, whose office it was partly to enliven the services of the Temple with sacred minstrelsy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm" title="Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:">1Chronicles 25:1</a>), but chiefly to be God's spokesmen, both declaring His will to Jew and Gentile ( <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm" title="Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.">Jeremiah 1:5</a>), and also maintaining religion and holiness by earnest preaching and other such means. In this way they were forerunners, and even representatives, of Christ, who is the one true and only Mediator between God and man. Not only Abraham, therefore, but the patriarchs generally are called "Christs and prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a>), as being speakers for God to man, and for man to God, until the true Christ and prophet came. Abimelech, moreover, is thus taught that he does not himself hold a near relation to God, but requires some one to speak for him; perhaps, too, he would gather from it that he had need of fuller instruction, and that he ought to try to attain to a higher level, and that Abraham would become a prophet to him in its other sense of being a teacher. (For the prophet as an intercessor, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/8-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away: entreat for me.">Exodus 8:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/9-19.htm" title="For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me at that time also.">Deuteronomy 9:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm" title="And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-19.htm" title="And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.">1Samuel 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-23.htm" title="Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:">1Samuel 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-6.htm" title="And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.

The office of the Nabi was twofold - to announce the will of God to melt <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>), and also to intercede with God for men (Ver. 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-11.htm">Jeremiah 14:11</a>). The use of the term Nabi in this place neither proves that the spirit of prophecy had not existed from the beginning (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25-27</a>), nor shows that the Pentateuch, which always uses this term, cannot be of greater antiquity than the time of Samuel, before which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>, the prophet was called a seer (Bohlen, Hartmann). As used in the Pentateuch the term describes the recipient of Divine revelations, and as such it was incorporated in the Mosaic legislation. During the period of the Judges the term <span class="accented">Roeh</span> appears to have come into use, and to have held its ground until the reformation of Samuel, when the older theocratic term was again reverted to (<span class="accented">vide</span> Havernick, &sect; 19). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall pray for thee</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> supra), <span class="cmt_word">and thou shalt live.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">live thou</span>, the imperative being used for the future in strong prophetic assurances (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-5.htm">Psalm 128:5</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, &sect; 130). <span class="cmt_word">And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">dying thou shalt die</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">thou, and all that are thine.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-8 Crooked policy will not prosper: it brings ourselves and others into danger. God gives Abimelech notice of his danger of sin, and his danger of death for his sin. Every wilful sinner is a dead man, but Abimelech pleads ignorance. If our consciences witness, that, however we may have been cheated into a snare, we have not knowingly sinned against God, it will be our rejoicing in the day of evil. It is matter of comfort to those who are honest, that God knows their honesty, and will acknowledge it. It is a great mercy to be hindered from committing sin; of this God must have the glory. But if we have ignorantly done wrong, that will not excuse us, if we knowingly persist in it. He that does wrong, whoever he is, prince or peasant, shall certainly receive for the wrong which he has done, unless he repent, and, if possible, make restitution.</body></html>
