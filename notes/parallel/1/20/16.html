The clause "and with all" must then be taken with this verb, and the whole be rendered, <span class= "ital">and in everything thou art even righted. </span>The correct rendering probably is, "And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother (a gift worth) a thousand (pieces) of silver: behold, it shall be to thee for a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee (that is,--so large a compensation for the wrong done thee in taking thee from thy husband, will be a proof to all thy friends and attendants that thou hast not been disgraced, but treated with honour); and in respect of all that has happened thou art thus righted."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy Brother a thousand pieces of silver.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">a thousand of silver</span>, the exact weight of each piece being uncertain. If sacred shekels (Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch) their value would be over &pound;130, if shekels ordinary somewhat less. Behold, he - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy brother; or it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the present (LXX., Vulgate, Targums, Syriac) - <span class="cmt_word">is to thee a covering of the eyes.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (from a root signifying to cover over) has been understood as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a propitiatory gift - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> (LXX.), or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a veil for the protection of the face; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and, according as the subject of the sentence has been regarded as Abraham or the sum of money, the sense of the clause has been given as either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy brother, will be to thee a protection, hiding thee like a veil, from the voluptuous desires of others (Aben Ezra, Cajetan, Calvin, Kalisch); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this present of mine, will be to thee a propitiatory offering to make thee overlook my offence (Chrysostom, Gesenius, Furst, Knobel, Delitzsch, Keil, Murphy); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a declaration of thy purity, and so a defense to thee against any calumnious aspersions (Castalio); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the purchase-money of a veil to hide thy beauty, lest others be ensnared (Vulgate, Amble, Kitto, Clark); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the means of procuring that bridal veil which married females should never lay aside (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>; Dathe, Vitringa, Michaelis, Baumgarten, Rosenm&uuml;ller). The exact sense of this difficult passage can scarcely be said to have been determined, though of the above interpretations the choice seems to lie between the first and second. <span class="cmt_word">Unto all that are with thee, and with all other</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> in presence of thy domestics and of all with whom thou mayest yet mingle, either Abraham will be thy best defense, or let my gift be an atonement, or a veil, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Thus she was reproved</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>.

Agreements to deceive generally end in shame and sorrow; and restraints from sin, though by suffering, should be thankfully acknowledged. Though the Lord rebuke, yet he will pardon and deliver his people, and he will give them favour in the sight of those with whom they sojourn; and overrule their infirmities, when they are humbled for them, so that they shall prove useful to themselves and others.</body></html>
