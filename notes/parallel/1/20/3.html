Moreover, the sole reason for calling that narrative Jehovistic is that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-17.htm" title="And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.">Genesis 12:17</a> it is Jehovah who plagues Pharaoh for Sarah's sake. But equally here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-18.htm" title="For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.">Genesis 20:18</a>, it is Jehovah who protects Sarah from Abimelech; in both cases it being the covenant- God, who saves his people from injury.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art but a dead man.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">thou diest, </span>or <span class= "ital">art dying. </span>Abimelech was already suffering from the malady spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-17.htm" title="So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children.">Genesis 20:17</a>, when Elohim appeared to him and warned him that death would be the result of perseverance in retaining Sarah. It was this malady which was the cause of the abstention spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-4.htm" title="But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, will you slay also a righteous nation?">Genesis 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-6.htm" title="And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; for I also withheld you from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you not to touch her.">Genesis 20:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God</span> - <span class="accented">Elohim</span>; whence the present chapter, with the exception of Ver. 18, is assigned to the Elohist (Tuch, De Wette, Bleek, Davidson), and the incident at Gerar explained as the original legend, of which the story of Sarah's abduction by Pharaoh is the Jehovistic imitation. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the use of Elohim throughout the present chapter is sufficiently accounted for by observing that it describes the intercourse of Deity with a heathen monarch, to whom the name of Jehovah was unknown, while the employment of the latter term in Ver. 18 may be ascribed to the fact that it is the covenant God of Sarah who there interposes for her protection; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the apparent resemblance between the two incidents is more than counterbalanced by the points of diversity which subsist between them - <span class="cmt_word">came to Abimelech in a dream</span> - the usual mode of self-revelation employed by Elohim towards heathen. Cf. Pharaoh's dreams (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>) and Nebuchadnezzar's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-5.htm">Daniel 4:5</a>), as distinguished from the visions in which Jehovah manifests his presence to his people. Cf. the theophanies vouchsafed to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>) and to Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24</a>), and the visions granted to Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-9</a>) and the prophets generally, which, though sometimes occurring in dreams, were yet a higher form of Divine manifestation than the dreams - <span class="cmt_word">by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">behold thyself dying</span>, or <span class="accented">about to die -</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.). Abimelech, it is probable, was by this time suffering from the malady which had fallen on his house (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 17) - <span class="cmt_word">for</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on account of) <span class="cmt_word">the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife</span> - literally, <span class="accented">married to a husband</span>, or under lordship to a lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-8 Crooked policy will not prosper: it brings ourselves and others into danger. God gives Abimelech notice of his danger of sin, and his danger of death for his sin. Every wilful sinner is a dead man, but Abimelech pleads ignorance. If our consciences witness, that, however we may have been cheated into a snare, we have not knowingly sinned against God, it will be our rejoicing in the day of evil. It is matter of comfort to those who are honest, that God knows their honesty, and will acknowledge it. It is a great mercy to be hindered from committing sin; of this God must have the glory. But if we have ignorantly done wrong, that will not excuse us, if we knowingly persist in it. He that does wrong, whoever he is, prince or peasant, shall certainly receive for the wrong which he has done, unless he repent, and, if possible, make restitution.</body></html>
