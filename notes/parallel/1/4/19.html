The names of his wives bear testimony to the existence, even at this early date, of considerable refinement; for I can scarcely believe that we need go to the Assyrian dialect for the meaning of two words for which Hebrew suffices. They are explained in Assyrian as being <span class= "ital">edhatu, </span>"darkness," and <span class= "ital">tzillatu, </span>"the shades of night." In Hebrew Adah means <span class= "ital">ornament, </span>especially that which is for the decoration of the person; while Zillah means <span class= "ital">shadow, </span>which agrees very closely with the Assyrian explanation. Both have distinguished children. Jabal, Adah's eldest son, took to a nomadic life, whence his name, which means <span class= "ital">wanderer, </span>and was looked up to by the nomad tribes as their founder. The difference between their mode of life and that of Abel was that they perpetually changed their habitation, while he remained in the neighbourhood of Adam's dwelling. The younger, "Jubal," that is, the <span class= "ital">music-player, </span>"was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ." Of these instruments, the <span class= "ital">kinnor, </span>always translated "harp" in our version, was certainly a stringed instrument, a guitar or lyre. The other, in Hebrew <span class= "ital">'ugab, </span>is mentioned only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-12.htm" title="They take the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.">Job 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-31.htm" title="My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.">Job 30:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-4.htm" title="Praise him with the tambourine and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.">Psalm 150:4</a><span class= "ital">. </span>It was a small wind instrument, a reed or pipe.<p>The son of Zillah attained to higher distinction. He is the first "sharpener (or hammerer) of every instrument of copper and iron." Copper is constantly found cropping up in a comparatively pure state upon the surface of the ground, and was the first metal made use of by man. It is comparatively soft, and is easily beaten to an edge; but it was long before men learned the art of mixing with it an alloy of tin, and so producing the far harder substance, bronze. The alloy to which we give the name of brass was absolutely unknown to the ancients. The discovery of iron marks a far greater advance in metallurgy, as the ore has to be smelted, and the implement produced is more precious. The Greeks in the time of Homer seem to have known it only as a rarity imported from the north; and Rawlinson (Anc. Monarchies, i. 167) mentions that in Mesopotamia, while silver was the metal current in traffic, iron was so rare as to be regarded as something very precious. The name of this hero is "Tubal-cain." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>, Tubal brings copper to the mart of Tyre, and in Persian the word means copper. Cain is a distinct name from that of Adam's firstborn, and means, in most Semitic languages, <span class= "ital">smith; </span>thus Tubal-cain probably signifies <span class= "ital">coppersmith.</span><p><span class= "bld">The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</span>--The same as Naomi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm" title="And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.">Ruth 1:2</a>), and meaning <span class= "ital">beauty, loveliness. </span>As women are not mentioned in the genealogies, and as no history follows of this personage, her name must be given as an indication that a great advance had been made, not only in the arts, but also in the elegancies of life. Women could not have been mere drudges and household slaves, nor men coarse and boorish, when Naamah's beauty was so highly appreciated. The Rabbins have turned her into a demon, and given free play to their imagination in the stories they have invented concerning her.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Lamech took unto him two wives</span>. Being the first polygamist of whom mention is made, the first by whom "the ethical aspect of marriage, as ordained by God, was turned into the lust of the eye and lust of the flesh" (Keil). Though afterwards permitted because of the hardness of men's hearts, it was not so from the beginning. This was "a new evil, without even the pretext that the first wife had no children, which held its ground until Christianity restored the original law - <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>" (Inglis). The names of Lamech's wives were suggestive of sensual attractions. <span class="cmt_word">The name of the one Adah</span>, the Adorned (Gesenius), <span class="cmt_word">and the name of the other Zillah</span>, the shady or the tinkling (Keil), the musical player (Lange), the shadow (Wordsworth). "Did Lamech choose a wife to gratify the eye with loveliness? and was he soon sated with that which is so short-lived as beauty, and then chose another wife in addition to Adah? But a second wife is hardly a wife; she is only the shadow of a wife" (ibid.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-24 One of Cain's wicked race is the first recorded, as having broken the law of marriage. Hitherto, one man had but one wife at a time; but Lamech took two. Wordly things, are the only things that carnal, wicked people set their hearts upon, and are most clever and industrious about. So it was with this race of Cain. Here was a father of shepherds, and a father of musicians, but not a father of the faithful. Here is one to teach about brass and iron, but none to teach the good knowledge of the Lord: here are devices how to be rich, and how to be mighty, and how to be merry; but nothing of God, of his fear and service. Present things fill the heads of most. Lamech had enemies, whom he had provoked. He draws a comparison betwixt himself and his ancestor Cain; and flatters himself that he is much less criminal. He seems to abuse the patience of God in sparing Cain, into an encouragement to expect that he may sin unpunished.</body></html>
