Worker in brass or iron;related to Persian, <span class="accented">tupal</span>, iron dross (Gesenius, Rodiger, Delitzsch). Keil and Furst think this Persian root cannot be regarded as the proper explanation of the name. Furst suggests that the tribe may have been originally named Tubal, and known as inventors of smith-work and agricultural implements, and that Cain may have been afterwards added to them to identify them as Cainites (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Lex. sub hem.'). The name Tubal, like the previous names Jabal and Jubal, is connected with the root <span class="accented">yabal</span>, to flow, and probably was indicative of the general prosperity of the race. Their ancestor was specially distinguished <span class="cmt_word">as an instructor</span> (literally, <span class="accented">a whetter</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of every artificer</span> (instrument, LXX., Vulgate, Kalisch) <span class="cmt_word">in brass</span> (more correctly copper) <span class="cmt_word">and iron</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, according to Gesenius a quadrilateral from the Genesis <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, to transfix, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> appended; according to Furst out of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to be hard, by resolving the dagesh into <span class="accented">r</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah</span> - the lovely. Considering. the general significance of names, we shall scarcely go astray if with Kalisch we find in the name of the sister of Tubal-cain, "the beautiful," as compared with that of Adam's wife, "the living," a growing symptom of the degeneracy of the times. Beauty, rather than helpfulness, was now become the chief attraction in woman. Men selected wives for their lovely forms and faces rather than for their loving and pious hearts. The reason for the introduction of Naamah s name into the narrative commentators generally are at a loss to discover. Ingiis with much ingenuity connects it with the tragedy which some see in the lines that follow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-24 One of Cain's wicked race is the first recorded, as having broken the law of marriage. Hitherto, one man had but one wife at a time; but Lamech took two. Wordly things, are the only things that carnal, wicked people set their hearts upon, and are most clever and industrious about. So it was with this race of Cain. Here was a father of shepherds, and a father of musicians, but not a father of the faithful. Here is one to teach about brass and iron, but none to teach the good knowledge of the Lord: here are devices how to be rich, and how to be mighty, and how to be merry; but nothing of God, of his fear and service. Present things fill the heads of most. Lamech had enemies, whom he had provoked. He draws a comparison betwixt himself and his ancestor Cain; and flatters himself that he is much less criminal. He seems to abuse the patience of God in sparing Cain, into an encouragement to expect that he may sin unpunished.</body></html>
