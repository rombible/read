It is in accordance with the manner of the Hebrew language to have only one word for an act and its result. Thus <span class= "ital">work </span>and <span class= "ital">wages </span>are expressed by the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-11.htm" title="Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the world, Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.">Isaiah 62:11</a>. The full meaning, therefore, is, "My sin is past forgiveness, and its result is an intolerable punishment." This latter idea seems foremost in Cain's mind, and is dwelt upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-14.htm" title="Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.">Genesis 4:14</a>. He there complains that he is driven, not <span class= "ital">"</span>from the face of the earth," which was impossible, but from the <span class= "ital">adamah, </span>his dear native soil, banished from which, he must go into the silence and solitude of an earth unknown and untracked. And next, "from thy face shall I be hid." Naturally, Cain had no idea of an omnipresent God, and away from the <span class= "ital">adamah </span>he supposed that it would be impossible to enjoy the Divine favour and protection. Without this there would be no safety for him anywhere, so that he must rove about perpetually, and "every one that findeth me shall slay me." In the <span class= "ital">adamah </span>Jehovah would protect him; away from it, men, unseen by Jehovah, might do as they liked. But who were these men? Some commentators answer, Adam's other sons, especially those who had attached themselves to Abel. Others say that Adam's creation was not identical with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm" title="So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.">Genesis 1:27</a>, but was that of the highest type of the human race, and had been preceded by the production of inferior races, of whose existence there are widespread proofs. But others, with more probability, think that Cain's was a vain apprehension. How could he know that Adam and his family were the sole inhabitants of the earth? Naturally he expected to find farther on what he had left behind; a man and woman with stalwart sons: and that these, regarding him as an interloper come to rob them, and seeing in his ways proof of guilt, would at once attack and slay him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment</span> (or my sin) <span class="cmt_word">is greater than I can bear</span>. Or, than can be borne away. Interpreted in either way, this is scarcely the language of confession, "sufficiens confessio, sod intempestiva" (Chrysostom); but, as the majority of interpreters are agreed, of desperation (Calvin). According to the first rendering Cain is understood as deploring not the enormity of his sin, but the severity of his punishment, under which he reels and staggers as one amazed (Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Calvin, Keil, Delitzsch, Murphy, Alford, Speakers, Kalisch). According to the second, from the terrific nature of the blow which had descended on him Cain awakens to the conviction that his sin was too heinous to be forgiven (margin, Septuagint, Vulgate, Theodotion, Arabic, Syrlac, Onkelos, Samaritan, Gesenins, Wordsworth). The first of these is favored by the remaining portion of his address, which shows that that which had paralyzed his guilty spirit was not the wickedness of his deed, but the overwhelming retribution which had leapt so unexpectedly from its bosom. The real cause of his despair was the sentence which had gone forth against him, and the articles of which he now recapitulates. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou hast driven me this day</span> - "Out of the sentence of his own conscience Cain makes a clear, positive, Divine decree of banishment" (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">from the face of the earth</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">the ground</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of Eden. "Adam's sin brought expulsion from the inner circle, Cain's from the outer" (Bonar). <span class="cmt_word">And from thy face shall I be hid.</span> Either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the place where the Divine presence was specially manifested, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the gate of Eden, which does not contradict (Kalisch) the great Biblical truth of the Divine omnipresence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>); or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> more generally, from the enjoyment of the Divine favor (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-18.htm">Deuteronomy 31:18</a>). "To be hidden from the face of God is to be not regarded by God, or not protected by his guardian care" (Calvin). <span class="cmt_word">And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond</span>. "A vagabond and a runagate" (Tyndale, Coverdale, 'Bishops' Bible'). <span class="accented">Vagus et profugus</span> (Vulgate; vagus et <span class="accented">infestus agitationibus</span> (Tremellius and Junins). <span class="cmt_word">In the earth</span>. The contemplation of his miserable doom, acting on his guilty conscience, inspired him with a fearful apprehension, to which in closing he gives expression in the hearing of his Judge. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall come to pass, that every one</span> - not beast (Josephus, Kimchi, Michaelis), but person - <span class="cmt_word">that findeth me shall slay me.</span> "Amongst the ancient Romans a man cursed for any wickedness might be freely killed (Dionysius Halicarnass., 1. 2). Amongst the Gauls the excommunicated were deprived of any benefit of law (Caesar. 'de Bello Gallico,' 50:6; cf. also Sophocles, '(Edip. Tyrannus')" (Ainsworth). The apprehension which Cain cherished has been explained as an oversight on the part of the narrator (Schumann and Tuch); as a mistake on the part of Cain, who had no reason to know that the world was not populated (T. Lewis); as referring to the blood avengers of the future who might arise from his father's family (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch); and also, and perhaps with as much probability, as indicating that already, in the 130 years that had gone, Adam's descendants were not limited to the two brothers and their wives (Havernick). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-15 Malice in the heart ends in murder by the hands. Cain slew Abel, his own brother, his own mother's son, whom he ought to have loved; his younger brother, whom he ought to have protected; a good brother, who had never done him any wrong. What fatal effects were these of our first parents' sin, and how must their hearts have been filled with anguish! Observe the pride, unbelief, and impenitence of Cain. He denies the crime, as if he could conceal it from God. He tries to cover a deliberate murder with a deliberate lie. Murder is a crying sin. Blood calls for blood, the blood of the murdered for the blood of the murderer. Who knows the extent and weight of a Divine curse, how far it reaches, how deep it pierces? Only in Christ are believers saved from it, and inherit the blessing. Cain was cursed from the earth. He found his punishment there where he chose his portion, and set his heart. Every creature is to us what God makes it, a comfort or a cross, a blessing or a curse. The wickedness of the wicked brings a curse upon all they do, and all they have. Cain complains not of his sin, but of his punishment. It shows great hardness of heart to be more concerned about our sufferings than our sins. God has wise and holy ends in prolonging the lives even of very wicked men. It is in vain to inquire what was the mark set upon Cain. It was doubtless known, both as a brand of infamy on Cain, and a token from God that they should not kill him. Abel, being dead, yet speaketh. He tells the heinous guilt of murder, and warns us to stifle the first risings of wrath, and teaches us that persecution must be expected by the righteous. Also, that there is a future state, and an eternal recompence to be enjoyed, through faith in Christ and his atoning sacrifice. And he tells us the excellency of faith in the atoning sacrifice and blood of the Lamb of God. Cain slew his brother, because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous, 1Jo 3:12. In consequence of the enmity put between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, the war broke out, which has been waged ever since. In this war we are all concerned, none are neuter; our Captain has declared, He that is not with me is against me. Let us decidedly, yet in meekness, support the cause of truth and righteousness against Satan.</body></html>
