To tillage and a pastoral life they added metallurgy and music; and the knowledge not only of copper and its uses, but even of iron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>), must have given them a command over the resources of nature so great as to have vastly diminished the curse of labour, and made their lives easy and luxurious.<p><span class= "bld">I have gotten a man from the Lord.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">who is Jehovah. </span>It is inconceivable that <span class= "ital">eth </span>should have here a different meaning from that which it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>. It there gives emphasis to the object of the verb: "God created <span class= "ital">eth </span>the heaven and <span class= "ital">eth </span>the earth," that is, <span class= "ital">even the heaven and even the earth. </span>So also here, "I have gotten a man <span class= "ital">eth </span>Jehovah." <span class= "ital">even Jehovah. </span>The objection that this implies too advanced a knowledge of Messianic ideas is unfounded. It is we who read backward, and put our ideas into the words of the narrative. These words were intended to lead on to those ideas, but they were at present only as the germ, or as the filament in the acorn which contains the oak-tree. If there is one thing certain, it is that religious knowledge was given gradually, and that the significance of the name Jehovah was revealed by slow degrees. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm" title="And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 4:26</a>.) Eve attached no notion of divinity to the name; still less did she foresee that by the superstition of the Jews the title Lord would be substituted for it. We distinctly know that Jehovah was not even the patriarchal name of the Deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm" title="And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.">Exodus 6:3</a>), and still less could it have been God's title in Paradise. But Eve had received the promise that her seed should crush the head of her enemy, and to this promise her words referred, and the title in her mouth meant probably no more than "the coming One." Apparently, too, it was out of Eve's words that this most significant title of the covenant God arose. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>on names <span class= "ital">Elohim </span>and <span class= "ital">Jehovah-Elohim, </span>at end of this book.)<p>Further, Eve calls Cain "a man," Heb., <span class= "ital">ish, </span>a being. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>.) As Cain was the first infant, no word as yet existed for child. But in calling him "a being, even the future one," a lower sense, often attached to these words, is not to be altogether excluded. It has been said that Eve, in the birth of this child, saw the remedy for death. Death might slay the individual, but the existence of the race was secured. Her words therefore might be paraphrased: "I have gained a man, who is the pledge of future existence." Mankind is thus that which shall exist. Now, it is one of the properties of Holy Scripture that words spoken in a lower and ordinary sense are often prophetic: so that even supposing that Eve meant no more than this, it would not exclude the higher interpretation. It is evident, however, from the fact of these words having been so treasured up, that they were regarded by Adam and his posterity as having no commonplace meaning; and this interpretation has a suspiciously modern look about it. Finally, in Christ alone man does exist and endure. He is the perfect man--man's highest level; so that even thus there would be a presage of immortality for man in the saying, "I have gained a man, even he that shall become." Grant that it was then but an indefinite yearning: it was one, nevertheless, which all future inspiration was to make distinct and clear; and now, under the guidance of the Spirit, it has become the especial title of the Second Person in the Holy Trinity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Exiled from Eden, o'er, canopied by grace, animated by hope, assured of the Divine forgiveness, and filled with a sweet peace, the first pair enter on their life experience of labor and sorrow, and the human race begins its onward course of development in sight of the mystic cherubim and flaming sword. <span class="cmt_word">And Adam knew Eve, his wife</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "recognized her nature and uses" (Alford; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-17.htm">Numbers 31:17</a>). The act here mentioned is recorded not to indicate that paradise was "non nuptiis, sed virginitate destinatum" (Jerome), but to show that while Adam was formed from the soil, and Eve from a rib taken from his side, the other members of the race were to be produced "neque ex terra neque quovis alio mode, sed ex conjunctione maris et foeminse" (Rungius). <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived</span>. The Divine blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), which in its operation had been suspended during the period of innocence, while yet it was undetermined whether the race should develop as a holy or a fallen seed, now begins to take effect (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bare Cain</span>. <span class="accented">Acquisition</span> or <span class="accented">Possession</span>, <span class="accented">from kanah</span>, to acquire (Gesenius). Cf. Eve's exclamation. Kalisch, connecting it with <span class="accented">kun</span> or <span class="accented">kin</span>, to strike, sees an allusion to his character and subsequent history as a murderer, and supposes it was not given to him at birth, but at a later period. Tayler Lewis falls back upon the primitive idea of the root, to create, to procreate, generate, of which he cites as examples <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, and takes the derivative to signify the <span class="accented">seed</span>, explaining Eve's exclamation <span class="accented">kanithi kain as</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">genui genitum</span> or <span class="accented">generationem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And said, I have gotten a man from the Lord</span>. The popular interpretation, regarding <span class="accented">kani-thi</span> as the emphatic word in the sentence, understands Eve to say that her child was a thing achieved, an acquisition gained, either from the Lord (Onkelos, Calvin) or by means of, with the help of, the Lord (LXX., Vulgate, Jerome, Dathe, Keil), or for the Lord (Syriac). If, however, the emphatic term is Jehovah, then <span class="accented">eth</span> with Makkeph following will be the sign of the accusative, and the sense will be, "I have gotten a man - Jehovah" (Jonathon, Luther, Baumgarten, Lewis); to which, perhaps, the chief objections are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it appears to anticipate the development of the Messianic idea, and credits Eve with too mature Christological conceptions (Lange), though if Enoch in the seventh generation recognized Jehovah as the coming One, why might not Eve have done so in the first? (Bonar), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that if the thoughts of Eve had been running so closely on the identity of the coming Deliverer with Jehovah, the child would have been called Jehovah, or at least some compound of Jehovah, such as Ishiah - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> - or Coniah - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> (Murphy); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> si scivit Messiam esse debet Jovam, quomodo existimare potuit Cainam ease Messiam, quem sciebat esse ab Adamo genitum? (Dathe); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that, while it might not be difficult to account for the mistake of a joyful mother in supposing that the fruit of her womb was the promised seed, though, "if she did believe so, it is a caution to interpreters of prophecy" (Inglis), it is not so easy to explain her belief that the promised seed was to be Jehovah, since no such announcement was made in the Prot-evangel. But whichever view be adopted of the construction of the language, it is obvious that Eve's utterance was the dictate of faith. In Cain's birth she recognized the earnest and guarantee of the promised seed, and in token of her faith gave her child a name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-20.htm">Genesis 3:20</a>), which may also explain her use of the Divine name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> instead of <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, which she employed when conversing with the serpent. That Eve denominates her infant a man has been thought to indicate that she had previously borne daughters who had grown to womanhood, and that she expected her young and tender babe to reach maturity. Murphy thinks this opinion probable; but the impression conveyed, by the narrative is that Cain was the first-born of the human family. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 When Cain was born, Eve said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. Perhaps she thought that this was the promised seed. If so, she was wofully disappointed. Abel signifies vanity: when she thought she had the promised seed in Cain, whose name signifies possession, she was so taken up with him that another son was as vanity to her. Observe, each son had a calling. It is the will of God for every one to have something to do in this world. Parents ought to bring up their children to work. Give them a Bible and a calling, said good Mr. Dod, and God be with them. We may believe that God commanded Adam, after the fall, to shed the blood of innocent animals, and after their death to burn part or the whole of their bodies by fire. Thus that punishment which sinners deserve, even the death of the body, and the wrath of God, of which fire is a well-known emblem, and also the sufferings of Christ, were prefigured. Observe that the religious worship of God is no new invention. It was from the beginning; it is the good old way, Jer 6:16. The offerings of Cain and Abel were different. Cain showed a proud, unbelieving heart. Therefore he and his offering were rejected. Abel came as a sinner, and according to God's appointment, by his sacrifice expressing humility, sincerity, and believing obedience. Thus, seeking the benefit of the new covenant of mercy, through the promised Seed, his sacrifice had a token that God accepted it. Abel offered in faith, and Cain did not, Heb 11:4. In all ages there have been two sorts of worshippers, such as Cain and Abel; namely, proud, hardened despisers of the gospel method of salvation, who attempt to please God in ways of their own devising; and humble believers, who draw near to him in the way he has revealed. Cain indulged malignant anger against Abel. He harboured an evil spirit of discontent and rebellion against God. God notices all our sinful passions and discontents. There is not an angry, envious, or fretful look, that escapes his observing eye. The Lord reasoned with this rebellious man; if he came in the right way, he should be accepted. Some understand this as an intimation of mercy. If thou doest not well, sin, that is, the sin-offering, lies at the door, and thou mayest take the benefit of it. The same word signifies sin, and a sacrifice for sin. Though thou hast not done well, yet do not despair; the remedy is at hand. Christ, the great sin-offering, is said to stand at the door, Re 3:20. And those well deserve to perish in their sins, that will not go to the door to ask for the benefit of this sin-offering. God's acceptance of Abel's offering did not change the birthright, and make it his; why then should Cain be so angry? Sinful heats and disquiets vanish before a strict and fair inquiry into the cause.</body></html>
