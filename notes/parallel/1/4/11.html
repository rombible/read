Cain was the first human being on whom a curse was inflicted, and it was to rise up from the ground, the portion of the earth won and subdued by man, to punish him. He had polluted man's habitation, and now, when he tilled the soil, it would resist him as an enemy, by refusing "to yield unto him her strength." He had been an unsuccessful man before, and outstripped in the race of life by the younger son; for the future his struggle with the conditions of life will be still harder. The reason for this follows: "a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth." Restless and uneasy, and haunted by the remembrance of his crime, he shall become a wanderer, not merely in the <span class= "ital">adamah, </span>his native soil, but in the earth. Poverty must necessarily be the lot of one thus roaming, not in search of a better lot, but under the compulsion of an evil conscience. Finally, however, we find that Cain's feelings grew more calm, and being comforted by the presence of a wife and children, "he builded a city," and had at last a home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - Convicted, if not humbled, the culprit is speechless, and can only listen in consternation to the threefold judgment which pronounced him "<span class="accented">cursed</span> in his soul, vagabond in his body, and unprosperous in his labors" (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">And now</span> - either <span class="accented">at this time</span>, already (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>), or for <span class="accented">this cause</span>, because thou hast done this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-9.htm">Genesis 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">art thou cursed.</span> <span class="accented">The first curse pronounced against a human being</span>. Adam and Eve were not cursed, though the serpent and the devil were. If we may not conclude that Cain was thereby for ever excluded from the hope of salvation if he should repent, still less must we explain the Divine judgment down to a simple sentence of banishment from Eden. The fratricide was henceforth to bear the displeasure and indignation of his Maker, whose image in Abel he had slain; of which indignation and displeasure his expatriation was to be a symbol. Different explanations have been offered of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">from the earth</span>, or <span class="accented">ground</span>, <span class="accented">Ad-</span>hamah, which, however, cannot mean <span class="accented">more than the ground</span>, which already had been cursed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; Lunge), since "the curse of the soil and the misery of man cannot well be compared with each other" (Kalisch); or simply <span class="accented">away from the district</span>, the scene of his crime (Kalisch, Speaker's, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Tuch, Gerlach, Delitzsch), as if all that the sentence implied was banishment from Eden; but must involve in addition the idea that the curse was to leap upon him <span class="accented">from the earth</span>, or ground, in general (Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Knobel, Alford, Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">Which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand</span>.

Their tillage of the ground was not to prosper, which ultimately, Bonar thinks, drove the Cainites to city-building and mechanical invention. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">In denying him a home</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>A fugitive and a vagabond</span> - literally, <span class="accented">moving and wandering</span>; "<span class="accented">groan</span>ing and trembling" (LXX., erroneously), "<span class="accented">banished</span> and homeless" (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou be in the earth</span>. "As robbers are wont to be who have no quiet and secure resting-place" (Calvin); driven on by the agonizing tortures of a remorseful and alarmed conscience, and not simply by "<span class="accented">the</span> earth denying to him the expected fruits of his labor" (Delitzsch). The ban of wandering, which David pronounced upon his enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>), in later years fell upon the Jews, who "for shedding the blood of Christ, the most innocent Lamb of God, are vagabonds to this day over the face of the earth" (Willet). Thus the earth was made the minister of God's curse, not a partaker of it, as some have strangely imagined, as if by drinking up the blood of Abel it had become a participant of Cain's crime (Delitzsch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-15 Malice in the heart ends in murder by the hands. Cain slew Abel, his own brother, his own mother's son, whom he ought to have loved; his younger brother, whom he ought to have protected; a good brother, who had never done him any wrong. What fatal effects were these of our first parents' sin, and how must their hearts have been filled with anguish! Observe the pride, unbelief, and impenitence of Cain. He denies the crime, as if he could conceal it from God. He tries to cover a deliberate murder with a deliberate lie. Murder is a crying sin. Blood calls for blood, the blood of the murdered for the blood of the murderer. Who knows the extent and weight of a Divine curse, how far it reaches, how deep it pierces? Only in Christ are believers saved from it, and inherit the blessing. Cain was cursed from the earth. He found his punishment there where he chose his portion, and set his heart. Every creature is to us what God makes it, a comfort or a cross, a blessing or a curse. The wickedness of the wicked brings a curse upon all they do, and all they have. Cain complains not of his sin, but of his punishment. It shows great hardness of heart to be more concerned about our sufferings than our sins. God has wise and holy ends in prolonging the lives even of very wicked men. It is in vain to inquire what was the mark set upon Cain. It was doubtless known, both as a brand of infamy on Cain, and a token from God that they should not kill him. Abel, being dead, yet speaketh. He tells the heinous guilt of murder, and warns us to stifle the first risings of wrath, and teaches us that persecution must be expected by the righteous. Also, that there is a future state, and an eternal recompence to be enjoyed, through faith in Christ and his atoning sacrifice. And he tells us the excellency of faith in the atoning sacrifice and blood of the Lamb of God. Cain slew his brother, because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous, 1Jo 3:12. In consequence of the enmity put between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, the war broke out, which has been waged ever since. In this war we are all concerned, none are neuter; our Captain has declared, He that is not with me is against me. Let us decidedly, yet in meekness, support the cause of truth and righteousness against Satan.</body></html>
