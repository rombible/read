Possibly 'Irad means <span class= "ital">citizen; </span>but these names have been so corrupted by transcribers that we cannot feel sure of them. Thus, here the LXX. calls 'Irad Ga�dad, and the Syriac 'Idor. In the list that follows, the names Mehujael (Samaritan <span class= "ital">Michel, </span>Syriac <span class= "ital">Mahvoyel</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>Methusael, Enoch, and Lamech (Heb., <span class= "ital">Lemech</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>have a certain degree of similitude with those in the line of the Sethites, whence many commentators have assumed that the two lists are variations of the same original record. But it is usually a similarity of sound only with a diversity of meaning. Thus Mehujael, <span class= "ital">smitten of God, </span>answers to Mahalaleel, <span class= "ital">glory to God; </span>Methusael, <span class= "ital">God's hero, </span>to Methuselah, <span class= "ital">the armed warrior. </span>Even when the names are the same, their history is often most diverse. Thus in the Cainite line Enoch is <span class= "ital">initiation </span>into city life, in the Sethite into a life of holiness; and the Cainite polygamist Lemech, rejoicing in the weapons invented by his son, is the very opposite of the Sethite Lemech, who calls his son Noah, <span class= "ital">quiet, rest</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Years passed away, the family of Cain grew to manhood, and, in imitation of their parents, founded homes for themselves. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Enoch</span> (whose wife probably would also be his sister, few caring at this early stage to intermarry with the accursed race) <span class="cmt_word">was born Irad.</span> <span class="accented">Townsman</span>, citizen, <span class="accented">urbanus civilis</span> (Keil, Lange); fleet as a wild ass (Murphy); ornament of a city, from Ir, a city (Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And Irad begat Mehujael.</span> Smitten of God (Keil, Gesenius, Murphy), the purified or formed of God (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">And Mehujael begat Methusael.</span> Man of God (Gesenius, Lange), man asked or man of El (Murphy), man of prayer (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">And Methusael begat Lamech</span>. Strong youth (Gesenius, Lange); man of prayer, youth (Murphy); king, by metathesis for <span class="accented">melech</span> (Wordsworth). The resemblance between these names and those in the line of Seth has been accounted for by supposing a commingling of the two genealogies, or one common primitive legend in two forms (Ewald, Knobel). But - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The similarity of the names does not necessarily imply the identity of the persons.

Hypocritical professors, who dissemble and trifle with God, are justly left to themselves to do something grossly scandalous. So they throw off that form of godliness to which they have been a reproach, and of which they deny the power. Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and we never find that he came into it again, to his comfort. The land Cain dwelt in was called the land of Nod, which means, 'shaking,' or 'trembling,' and so shows the restlessness and uneasiness of his own spirit, or 'the land of a vagabond:' they that depart from God cannot find rest any where else. Those on earth who looked for the heavenly city, chose to dwell in tabernacles or tents; but Cain, as not minding that city, built one on earth. Thus all who are cursed of God seek their settlement and satisfaction here below.</body></html>
