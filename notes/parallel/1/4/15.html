Cain was not branded nor marked in any way. What the Hebrew says is, "And Jehovah set," that is, appointed, "unto Cain a sign, that no one finding him should slay him." In a similar manner God appointed the rainbow as a sign unto Noah that mankind should never again be destroyed by a flood. Probably the sign here was also some natural phenomenon, the regular recurrence of which would assure Cain of his security, and so pacify his excited feelings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The condemned fratricide's apprehensions were allayed by a special act of grace. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto him, Therefore</span> (the LXX., Symm., Theodotion, Vulgate, Syriac, Dathius, translate Not so - <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">nequaquam</span>, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold</span>. <span class="accented">I.e. fully</span>, sevenfold vengeance - complete vengeance (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-28.htm">Leviticus 26:28</a>). In the case of Cain's murderer there was to be no such mitigation of the penalty as in the case of Cain himself; on the contrary, he would be visited more severely than Cain, as being guilty not alone of homicide, but of transgressing the Divine commandment which said that Cain was to live (Willet). As to why this special privilege was granted to Cain, it was not because "<span class="accented">the</span> early death of the pious Abel was in reality no punishment, but the highest boon (Kalisch), nor because banishment from God s presence was the greatest possible punishment, "having in itself the significance of a social human death" (Lange), nor because it was needful to spare life for the increase of posterity (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but perhaps - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To show that "<span class="accented">Vengeance</span> is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To prove the riches of the Divine clemency to sinful men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To serve as a warning against the crime of murder. To this probably there is a reference in the concluding clause. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord set a mark upon</span> - gave a sign to (LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</span> Commentators are divided as to whether this was a visible sign to repress avengers (the Rabbis, Luther, Calvin, Piscator, etc.), or an inward assurance to Cain himself that he should not be destroyed (Aben Ezra, Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesemus, Tuch, Kalisch, Delitzsch). In support of the former it is urged that an external badge would be more likely to repel assailants; while in favor of the latter it is pleaded that of seventy-six times in which <span class="accented">oth</span> occurs in the Old Testament, in seventy-five it is translated <span class="accented">sign</span>. If there was a visible mark upon the fugitive, it is impossible to say what it was; that it was a shaking (LXX.), or a continual fleeing from place to place (Lyra), or a horn in the head (Rabbis), a peculiar kind of dress (Clericus), are mere conceits. But, whatever it was, it was not a sign of Cain's forgiveness (Josephus), only a pledge of God's protection; Cf. the Divine prophetic sentence against the Jewish Cain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-15 Malice in the heart ends in murder by the hands. Cain slew Abel, his own brother, his own mother's son, whom he ought to have loved; his younger brother, whom he ought to have protected; a good brother, who had never done him any wrong. What fatal effects were these of our first parents' sin, and how must their hearts have been filled with anguish! Observe the pride, unbelief, and impenitence of Cain. He denies the crime, as if he could conceal it from God. He tries to cover a deliberate murder with a deliberate lie. Murder is a crying sin. Blood calls for blood, the blood of the murdered for the blood of the murderer. Who knows the extent and weight of a Divine curse, how far it reaches, how deep it pierces? Only in Christ are believers saved from it, and inherit the blessing. Cain was cursed from the earth. He found his punishment there where he chose his portion, and set his heart. Every creature is to us what God makes it, a comfort or a cross, a blessing or a curse. The wickedness of the wicked brings a curse upon all they do, and all they have. Cain complains not of his sin, but of his punishment. It shows great hardness of heart to be more concerned about our sufferings than our sins. God has wise and holy ends in prolonging the lives even of very wicked men. It is in vain to inquire what was the mark set upon Cain. It was doubtless known, both as a brand of infamy on Cain, and a token from God that they should not kill him. Abel, being dead, yet speaketh. He tells the heinous guilt of murder, and warns us to stifle the first risings of wrath, and teaches us that persecution must be expected by the righteous. Also, that there is a future state, and an eternal recompence to be enjoyed, through faith in Christ and his atoning sacrifice. And he tells us the excellency of faith in the atoning sacrifice and blood of the Lamb of God. Cain slew his brother, because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous, 1Jo 3:12. In consequence of the enmity put between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, the war broke out, which has been waged ever since. In this war we are all concerned, none are neuter; our Captain has declared, He that is not with me is against me. Let us decidedly, yet in meekness, support the cause of truth and righteousness against Satan.</body></html>
