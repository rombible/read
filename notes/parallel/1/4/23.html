Many commentators, however, regard the poem as hypothetical. "Were any one to wound me, I would with these weapons slay him." It would thus be a song of exultation over the armour which Tubal-cain had invented. It more probably records a fact, and is intended to show that, side by side with progress in the material arts, moral degradation was going on. Cain's own act is spoken of, not as a sin to be ashamed of, but as a deed of ancient heroism: not comparable, however, with the glory of Lamech, whose wrath shall be ten-fold. The poetry is vigorous, and marked by that parallelism which subsequently became the distinguishing quality of Hebrew verse. It should be translated:--<p>"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice,<p>Ye wives of Lemech. give ear unto my rede.<p>For I have slain a man for wounding me:<p>Even a young man for bruising me.<p>Truly Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,<p>And Lemech seventy and sevenfold."<p>It is remarkable that both of the words used for the attack upon Lamech refer to such wounds as might be given by a blow with the fist, while his word means to pierce, or run through with a sharp weapon. "Young man" is literally <span class= "ital">child, </span>but see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-14.htm" title="And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.">Genesis 21:14</a>.<p>With this boastful poem in praise of armed violence and bloodshed, joined with indications of luxury and a life of pleasure, the narrator closes the history of the race of Cain.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Lamech said unto his wives</span>. The words have an archaic simplicity which bespeak a high antiquity (<span class="accented">vide</span> Havernick's 'Introd.,' p. 105), naturally fall into that peculiar form of parallelism which is a well-known characteristic of Hebrew poetry, and on this account, as well as from the subject, have been aptly denominated <span class="accented">The Song of the Sword</span> (Ewald, p. 267). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Adah and gillah, Hear my voice;<br />Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech:<br />For I have slain a mum to my wounding (for my wound),<br />And a young man to my hurt (because of my strife).<br />If (for) Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,<br />Truly (and) Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</span> Origen wrote two whole books of his commentary on Genesis on this song, and at last pronounced it inexplicable. The chief difficulty in its exegesis concerns the sense in which the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> are to be taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> If the verb be rendered as a preterit (LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, Kalisch, Murphy, Alford, Jamieson, Luther), then Lamech is represented as informing his wives that in self-defense he has slain a young man who wounded him (not two men, as some read), but that there is no reason to apprehend danger on that account; for if God had promised to avenge Cain sevenfold, should any one kill him, he, being not a willful murderer, but at worst a culpable homicide, would be avenged seventy and sevenfold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> If the verb be regarded as a future (Aben Ezra, Calvin, Kiel, Speaker's. "The preterit stands for the future... (4) In protestations and assurances in which the mind of the speaker views the action as already accomplished, being as good as done" - Gesenius, 'Hebrews Gram.,'&sect; 126), then the father of Tubal-cain is depicted as exulting in the weapons which his son's genius had invented, and with boastful arrogance threatening death to the first man that should injure him, impiously asserting that by means of these same weapons he would exact upon his adversary a vengeance ten times greater than that which had been threatened against the murderer of Cain. Considering the character of the speaker and the spirit of the times, it is probable that this is the correct interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A third interpretation proposes to understand the words of Lamech hypothetically, as thus: - "If I should slay a man, then," etc. (Lunge, Bush); but this does not materially differ from the first, only putting the case conditionally, which the first asserts categorically. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> A fourth gives to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> the force of a question (<span class="accented">vide</span> Stanley Leathes, ' Hebrews Gram.,' p. 202), and imagines Lamech to be assuring his wives, who are supposed to have been apprehensive of some evil befalling their husband through the use of Tubal-cain's dangerous weapons, that there was no cause for their anxieties and alarms, as he had not slain a man, that he should be wounded, or a young man, that he should be hurt; but this interpretation, it may be fairly urged, is too strained to be even probably correct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-24 One of Cain's wicked race is the first recorded, as having broken the law of marriage. Hitherto, one man had but one wife at a time; but Lamech took two. Wordly things, are the only things that carnal, wicked people set their hearts upon, and are most clever and industrious about. So it was with this race of Cain. Here was a father of shepherds, and a father of musicians, but not a father of the faithful. Here is one to teach about brass and iron, but none to teach the good knowledge of the Lord: here are devices how to be rich, and how to be mighty, and how to be merry; but nothing of God, of his fear and service. Present things fill the heads of most. Lamech had enemies, whom he had provoked. He draws a comparison betwixt himself and his ancestor Cain; and flatters himself that he is much less criminal. He seems to abuse the patience of God in sparing Cain, into an encouragement to expect that he may sin unpunished.</body></html>
