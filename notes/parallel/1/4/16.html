Adam and his family probably worshipped with their faces towards the Paradise, and Cain, on migrating from the whole land of Eden, regarded himself as beyond the range of the vision of God. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-14.htm" title="Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.">Genesis 4:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The land of Nod.</span>--i.e., of wandering. Knobel supposes it was China, but this is too remote. Read without vowels, the word becomes India. All that is certain is that Cain emigrated into Eastern Asia, and as none of Noah's descendants, in the table of nations in Genesis 10, are described as having travelled eastward, many with Philippson and Knobel regard the Mongol race as the offspring of Cain.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord</span>. Not simply ended his interview and prepared to emigrate from the abode of his youth (Kalisch); but, more especially, withdrew from the neighborhood of the cherubim (v/de on ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt in the land of Nod</span>. The geographical situation of Nod (Knobel, China?) cannot be determined further than that it was <span class="cmt_word">on the east of Eden</span>, and its name, Nod, or wandering (cf. vers. 12, 14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>), was clearly derived from Cain s fugitive and vagabond life (<span class="accented">vide</span> Michaelis, 'Suppl,' p. 1612; and cf. Furst, 'Lex.,' sub <span class="accented">voce</span>), "which showeth, as Josephus well conjectureth, that Cain was not amended by his punishment, but waxed worse and worse, giving himself to rapine, robbery, oppression, deceit" (Willet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:16-18 Cain cast off all fear of God, and attended no more on God's ordinances. Hypocritical professors, who dissemble and trifle with God, are justly left to themselves to do something grossly scandalous. So they throw off that form of godliness to which they have been a reproach, and of which they deny the power. Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and we never find that he came into it again, to his comfort. The land Cain dwelt in was called the land of Nod, which means, 'shaking,' or 'trembling,' and so shows the restlessness and uneasiness of his own spirit, or 'the land of a vagabond:' they that depart from God cannot find rest any where else. Those on earth who looked for the heavenly city, chose to dwell in tabernacles or tents; but Cain, as not minding that city, built one on earth. Thus all who are cursed of God seek their settlement and satisfaction here below.</body></html>
