God is, first, the Elohim before whom his fathers had walked. Next, He is the Elohim who, as a shepherd, had watched over Jacob all his life long. But, thirdly, He is that Divine Presence which had been, and still was, Jacob's "goel," redeeming and rescuing him from all evil. The blessing is first general, the verb "bless" being singular, which, following the threefold repetition of God's name in the plural, is rightly used by Luther as a proof of a Trinity in Unity in the Godhead. Secondly, Ephraim and Manasseh are to bear the names, and be the representatives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Lastly, they are to grow into a multitude with extraordinary rapidity, the word used signifying that they were to increase with a prolificness as great as that of fishes.<p>The word "goel" is here used for the first time. It subsequently became the term for the nearest blood relative, whose duty it was to avenge a murder; but it is here used in its wider sense of a Saviour and a Deliverer. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm" title="Why say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a>, &c.) The angel who wrestled with Jacob cannot accurately be described as having appeared to him in the character of a deliverer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/32-24.htm" title="And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.">Genesis 32:24-30</a>). He appeared as an adversary; and Jacob learned in the struggle, by overcoming him, that he had power with God and man, and would prevail over all the difficulties and foes that still stood in his way. Moreover, the verb is present, "the angel that redeemeth me from all evil." Jacob recognised a Divine Presence which constantly guarded him, and which was ever his Redeemer and Saviour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15,16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he blessed Joseph</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his sons), <span class="cmt_word">and said, God</span>, - literally, the <span class="accented">Elohim</span>. The use of Elohim in a passage (vers. 15-19) which is undoubtedly Jehovistic in its import, and is by advanced critics (Davidson, Colenso) assigned to that writer, has been explained (Hengstenberg) as an indication that "<span class="accented">the</span> great spiritual Sun, Jehovah, was at that time," viz., at the entrance of the captivity, "concealed behind a cloud from the chosen race;" but, without resorting to any such doubtful hypothesis, it is sufficient to observe that Jacob practically identities the Elohim spoken of with Jehovah, while by using the former expression he conveys the thought that the blessing about to be pronounced proceeded forth, not from Deity in general, but from the particular Elohim who had graciously manifested himself in the manner after described - <span class="cmt_word">before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk</span>, - (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-40.htm">Genesis 24:40</a>) the God here referred to was one who had "a face," or manifested presence; in other words, was Jehovah - <span class="cmt_word">the God which fed me</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the Elohim shepherding me</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">all my life long</span> - literally, <span class="accented">from as yet</span> (sc. I was), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the beginning of my existence, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX. ) - <span class="cmt_word">unto this day, the Angel</span> - the Maleach here spoken of cannot possibly be a creature, since he is explicitly identified with Elohim, but must have been the Jehovah Angel with whom Jacob wrestled at the ford of Jabbok (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-23.htm">Genesis 32:23</a>-7-29). The reading of the Samaritan codex, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, the king, is open to suspicion - <span class="cmt_word">which redeemed me from all evil</span>, - literally, the (sc. angel) <span class="accented">redeeming me</span>; the first use of the <span class="accented">term goel</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to buy back or redeem (Gesenius), to separate or untie (Furst), or to stain as with blood, hence to be stained or polluted, as one who suffers a kinsman's blood to go unavenged, hence to remove the stain of blood by taking vengeance on the murderer (Taylor Lewis). Applied under the law to the next of kin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-13.htm">Leviticus 27:13, 15, 19</a>, etc., etc.), it is also used of God redeeming men, and especially Israel, from captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>). In this sense it was employed by Jacob (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a> with Genesis 49:18) and by Job (Job 19:21) to describe the Divine Rescuer who had delivered them from ill both temporal and spiritual, and who was to complete his emancipating work by ultimately ransoming them from the power of the grave. The <span class="accented">Goel</span> to whom both Jacob and Job looked forward, and of whom both Moses and the prophets testified, was Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">bless the lads</span>. The singular verb suggests to Luther the reflection that the writer "<span class="accented">conjungit in uno opere benedicendi tres personas, Deum Patrem, Deum Pastorem, et Angelum</span>," from which he draws the obvious conclusion, "<span class="accented">aunt igitur hi tres unus Deus et unus benedictor</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac</span>; - literally, <span class="accented">and my name and the name of my fathers shall be named in them, i.e.</span> they shall be counted my sons and the children of my ancestors, though born of thee (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lawson, Murphy, Wordsworth, and others); or, May this name be preserved by them, and the race of Abraham propagated by them? may the fathers and I live in them! (Gerlach, Kalisch); or, what seems more appropriate than either, May the grace and salvation enjoyed by my fathers and myself be renewed in them! (Keil, Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth</span>. The original conveys the sense of swarming like the fishes of the sea, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (from which comes the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;</span>, a fish, from being so wonderfully prolific), signifying to cover over with a multitude (vide Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub <span class="accented">voce</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:8-22 The two good men own God in their comforts. Joseph says, They are my sons whom God has given me. Jacob says, God hath showed me thy seed. Comforts are doubly sweet to us when we see them coming from God's hand. He not only prevents our fears, but exceeds our hopes. Jacob mentions the care the Divine providence had taken of him all his days. A great deal of hardship he had known in his time, but God kept him from the evil of his troubles. Now he was dying, he looked upon himself as redeemed from all sin and sorrow for ever. Christ, the Angel of the covenant, redeems from all evil. Deliverances from misery and dangers, by the Divine power, coming through the ransom of the blood of Christ, in Scripture are often called redemption. In blessing Joseph's sons, Jacob crossed hands. Joseph was willing to support his first-born, and would have removed his father's hands. But Jacob acted neither by mistake, nor from a partial affection to one more than the other; but from a spirit of prophecy, and by the Divine counsel. God, in bestowing blessings upon his people, gives more to some than to others, more gifts, graces, and comforts, and more of the good things of this life. He often gives most to those that are least likely. He chooses the weak things of the world; he raises the poor out of the dust. Grace observes not the order of nature, nor does God prefer those whom we think fittest to be preferred, but as it pleases him. How poor are they who have no riches but those of this world! How miserable is a death-bed to those who have no well-grounded hope of good, but dreadful apprehensions of evil, and nothing but evil for ever!</body></html>
