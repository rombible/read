This was undoubtedly the case; for though "Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the prince (and of him the Messiah), yet the birthright was Joseph's" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-2.htm" title="For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)">1Chronicles 5:2</a>). The legal right of the firstborn was a double share of the father's goods. This was bestowed upon Joseph in giving him two tribes, and to the other� sons but one. It was in a spiritual sense, and with reference to the promise that all mankind should be blessed in Jacob's seed, that the birthright was Judah's. As Joseph was the son of the chief and best-beloved wife, he had a sort of claim to the birthright; but in agreement with the law afterwards specially enacted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-15.htm" title="If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>), Jacob acknowledges that the right had belonged to Reuben, but excludes him from the possession of it as the penalty of his great and terrible sin. Simeon and Levi are next passed over, because of their cruelty, and so Judah takes Reuben's place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-50.htm">Genesis 41:50-52</a>) <span class="cmt_word">before I came unto thee into Egypt,</span> - this would almost seem to imply that Jacob knew of Joseph's having had sons born to him since his (Jacob's) arrival at Goshen - are mine (i.e. I shall reckon them as my own sons, giving them an equal place with the other members of my family); <span class="cmt_word">as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine</span> - literally, <span class="accented">Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine</span>. The double portion thus conferred upon Joseph in the persons of his son? was a practical investiture of him with the birthright of which Reuben had been deprived (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>), in respect at least of the inheritance; in respect of the honor of being the next connecting link in the chain of redemption, leading on and down to the coming of the Savior, the birthright appears to have been transferred to Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine</span> (i.e. shall be reckoned in thine own family), and <span class="cmt_word">shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</span> They should not form heads of separate tribes, but be ranked under the banners of Ephraim and Manasseh. It is uncertain whether Joseph had more sons than two (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>); if he had, they were included in the families of their brethren, as here directed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-28.htm">Numbers 26:28-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14-29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-7 The death-beds of believers, with the prayers and counsels of dying persons, are suited to make serious impressions upon the young, the gay, and the prosperous: we shall do well to take children on such occasions, when it can be done properly. If the Lord please, it is very desirable to bear our dying testimony to his truth, to his faithfulness, and the pleasantness of his ways. And one would wish so to live, as to give energy and weight to our dying exhortations. All true believers are blessed at their death, but all do not depart equally full of spiritual consolations. Jacob adopted Joseph's two sons. Let them not succeed their father, in his power and grandeur in Egypt; but let them succeed in the inheritance of the promise made to Abraham. Thus the aged dying patriarch teaches these young persons to take their lot with the people of God. He appoints each of them to be the head of a tribe. Those are worthy of double honour, who, through God's grace, break through the temptations of worldly wealth and preferment, to embrace religion in disgrace and poverty. Jacob will have Ephraim and Manasseh to know, that it is better to be low, and in the church, than high, and out of it.</body></html>
