also that Joseph's embalmed body was deposited there (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>, where the land is said to have been bought for a hundred kesitas); and, lastly, the testimony of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>, where a parcel of ground at Sychar, close to Shechem, is identified with the ground given by Jacob to Joseph. On the other hand, <span class= "ital">one Shechem </span>is an unnatural way of describing a town. Shechem also means, as we have seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>), the <span class= "ital">shoulder, </span>and Abul-walid, in his Lexicon, quoting this place, says that both the Hebrews and Arabs gave this name to any elevated strip of ground. This is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm" title="And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:">Numbers 34:11</a>, &c., though the word actually used, <span class= "ital">chatef, </span>is different. Probably, therefore, there was a play upon words in calling this plot of hill-ground Shechem, and not <span class= "ital">chatef</span>', but made with the intention of showing that the town of Shechem was the portion really signified. But what is meant by "Jacob having taken it out of the hand of the Amorite by his sword and his bow"? Shechem was strictly a town of the Hivites, but as they were but a feeble tribe, the term Amorite may be used to give greater glory to the exploit. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a>, the Amorites, literally <span class= "ital">mountaineers, </span>are described as owners of the whole country, and probably it was a term loosely applied to all the inhabitants of the uplands, though occasionally used with a more definite meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-21.htm" title="And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.">Genesis 15:21</a>). As Jacob so strongly condemns the conduct of Simeon and Levi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/49-5.htm" title="Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.">Genesis 49:5-7</a>), he can scarcely refer to their exploit, and therefore commentators generally suppose that he used the words prophetically, meaning, "which my descendants will, centuries hence, conquer for themselves with their swords and bows." But this is, to take the words of Holy Scripture in a non-natural sense. Jacob was the owner of a strip of this "shoulder-land" in a way in which he was not the owner of any other portion of land in Canaan, except the cave of Machpelah; and we find him sending his cattle to pasture there when he was himself dwelling far away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-12.htm" title="And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.">Genesis 37:12</a>). And it is quite possible that, after the inhuman treatment of the Hivites at Shechem, the Amorites did gather themselves together to avenge the Wrong, but were deterred by the threatening position taken up by Jacob, or even repulsed in an attack. The latter supposition would best harmonise with the fact that "a mighty terror fell upon all the cities round about" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-5.htm" title="And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.">Genesis 35:5</a>), and also with the exultant spirit in which Jacob, a pre-eminently peaceful and timid man, here alludes to the one military exploit of his life.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">I have given</span> - or, I give (Keil), I will give (Kalisch), the preterit being used prophetically as a future, or even as a present, the event being regarded, from its certainty, as already accomplished. It is thus not absolutely clear that Jacob here alludes to any past transaction in his own personal history - <span class="cmt_word">to thee one portion</span> - literally, one <span class="accented">shoulder</span>, or ridge, or elevated tract of land, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>; <span class="accented">unam pattern</span> (Vulgate), with which agree several of the ancient versions (Onkelos, Syriac) - <span class="cmt_word">above thy brethren, which I took</span> - or take (Keil), or shall take (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">out of the hand of the Amorite</span> - a general name for the inhabitants of Canaan (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 15:16) - <span class="cmt_word">with my sword and with my bow.</span> As Scripture has preserved no account of any military exploit in the history of Jacob such as is here described, the patriarch's language has been understood as referring to the plot of ground at Shechem which Jacob purchased of Hamor the father of Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>), and as signifying either that he had captured it by sword and bow, in the sense that his sons at the head of his armed retainers had put the inhabitants of the town to the sword, and so taken possession of the entire district (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy); or that, though he had peacefully paid for it, he yet required at a subsequent period to recover it by force of arms from the Canaanites (Lawson, Bush, Wordsworth); or that after the terrible tragedy at Shechem, when God put a fear upon the surrounding cities, Jacob and his sons stood in the gate of Shechem in the armed expectation of a hostile attack, and so may be said to have taken it by sword and bow (Rabbi Solomon, Lyra, Willet). It seems, however, better to regard the words as a prophetic utterance pointing forward to the conquest of Canaan, which Jacob here represents himself, in the persons of his descendants, as taking from the Amorites by means of sword and bow, and as intimating that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh would receive a double portion of the inheritance, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> being probably designed to convey a hint that the tract to be in future assigned to Joseph's descendants would be the region round about the ancient city Shechem (Ainsworth, Keil, Kalisch, Lunge, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:8-22 The two good men own God in their comforts. Joseph says, They are my sons whom God has given me. Jacob says, God hath showed me thy seed. Comforts are doubly sweet to us when we see them coming from God's hand. He not only prevents our fears, but exceeds our hopes. Jacob mentions the care the Divine providence had taken of him all his days. A great deal of hardship he had known in his time, but God kept him from the evil of his troubles. Now he was dying, he looked upon himself as redeemed from all sin and sorrow for ever. Christ, the Angel of the covenant, redeems from all evil. Deliverances from misery and dangers, by the Divine power, coming through the ransom of the blood of Christ, in Scripture are often called redemption. In blessing Joseph's sons, Jacob crossed hands. Joseph was willing to support his first-born, and would have removed his father's hands. But Jacob acted neither by mistake, nor from a partial affection to one more than the other; but from a spirit of prophecy, and by the Divine counsel. God, in bestowing blessings upon his people, gives more to some than to others, more gifts, graces, and comforts, and more of the good things of this life. He often gives most to those that are least likely. He chooses the weak things of the world; he raises the poor out of the dust. Grace observes not the order of nature, nor does God prefer those whom we think fittest to be preferred, but as it pleases him. How poor are they who have no riches but those of this world! How miserable is a death-bed to those who have no well-grounded hope of good, but dreadful apprehensions of evil, and nothing but evil for ever!</body></html>
