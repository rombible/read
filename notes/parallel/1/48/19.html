These are the sons of Joseph after their families.">Numbers 26:37</a>). It was the division of the tribe of Manasseh into two portions which made it politically insignificant, while Ephraim obtained a commanding position in the land of Canaan; and as Joshua was an Ephraimite, it naturally held the rank of foremost tribe during his days, and claimed it always afterwards. For Joshua, after the conquest of Canaan, must have held a position similar to that of General Washington after the independence of the United States had been secured, and all Israel would regard him as their ruler and chief. The influence also of the tribe would be strengthened by the ark being placed in one of its towns.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and over against that</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, the strongly adversative particle, signifying that which stands in front of, or opposite to, another thing) <span class="cmt_word">his younger brother shall be greater than he</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-33.htm">Numbers 1:33</a> with Numbers 1:35; 2:19 with Numbers 2:21), <span class="cmt_word">and his seed shall become a multitude of nations</span> - literally, <span class="accented">shall be a fullness of nations</span>. In the time of Moses this prediction began to realize itself. In the first census which took place in the wilderness the tribe of Ephraim had 40,500 men, while that of Manasseh could only reckon 32,200; in the second the numbers received a temporary alteration, Ephraim counting only 32,500, and Manasseh 52,700; but after the conquest the ascendancy of Ephraim wag restored, so that she easily assumed the lead among the ten northern tribes, and acquired a name and an influence only second to that of Judah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8.htm">Judges 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12.htm">Judges 12</a>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:8-22 The two good men own God in their comforts. Joseph says, They are my sons whom God has given me. Jacob says, God hath showed me thy seed. Comforts are doubly sweet to us when we see them coming from God's hand. He not only prevents our fears, but exceeds our hopes. Jacob mentions the care the Divine providence had taken of him all his days. A great deal of hardship he had known in his time, but God kept him from the evil of his troubles. Now he was dying, he looked upon himself as redeemed from all sin and sorrow for ever. Christ, the Angel of the covenant, redeems from all evil. Deliverances from misery and dangers, by the Divine power, coming through the ransom of the blood of Christ, in Scripture are often called redemption. In blessing Joseph's sons, Jacob crossed hands. Joseph was willing to support his first-born, and would have removed his father's hands. But Jacob acted neither by mistake, nor from a partial affection to one more than the other; but from a spirit of prophecy, and by the Divine counsel. God, in bestowing blessings upon his people, gives more to some than to others, more gifts, graces, and comforts, and more of the good things of this life. He often gives most to those that are least likely. He chooses the weak things of the world; he raises the poor out of the dust. Grace observes not the order of nature, nor does God prefer those whom we think fittest to be preferred, but as it pleases him. How poor are they who have no riches but those of this world! How miserable is a death-bed to those who have no well-grounded hope of good, but dreadful apprehensions of evil, and nothing but evil for ever!</body></html>
