Jacob therefore determines solemnly to consult God before finally taking so important a step, and no place could be more suitable than Beersheba, as both Abraham and Isaac had built altars there for Jehovah's worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm" title="And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.">Genesis 21:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm" title="And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dig a well.">Genesis 26:25</a>), and, moreover, it lay upon the route from Hebron to Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel</span> (as the head of the theocratic family) <span class="cmt_word">took his journey</span> - <span class="accented">literally, broke up</span>, sc. his encampment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-9.htm">Genesis 12:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">with all that he had, and came</span> - from Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to Beersheba,</span> - where Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>) and Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>) had both sojourned for considerable periods, and erected altars to Jehovah - <span class="cmt_word">and offered sacrifices unto the God</span> (the Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">of his father Isaac</span>. Probably giving thanks to God for the tidings concerning Joseph (Ainsworth); consulting God' about his journey to Egypt (Rosenm&uuml;ller); it may be, pouring out before God his fear as well as gratitude and joy, more especially if he thought about the stern prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>) which had been given to Abraham (Kalisch); perhaps commending himself and family to the care of his covenant God (Keil), and certainly praying that God would confirm to him and his the covenant which had been made with his fathers (Calvin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-4 Even as to those events and undertakings which appear most joyful, we should seek counsel, assistance, and a blessing from the Lord. Attending on his ordinances, and receiving the pledges of his covenant love, we expect his presence, and that peace which it confers. In all removals we should be reminded of our removal out of this world. Nothing can encourage us to fear no evil when passing through the valley of the shadow of death, but the presence of Christ.</body></html>
