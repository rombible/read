In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a> the designation used is "I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father." As on that former occasion when setting out for Padanaram, so now, when departing for Egypt, he receives a comforting assurance. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not to go down into Egypt</span>. Them was reason for Jacob's apprehensions, since Abraham had been in peril in the land of the Pharaohs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14-20</a>), Isaac had been forbidden to go thither (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-2.htm">Genesis 26:2</a>), and Egypt had been foreshadowed as a place of servitude for his descendants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is an irregular infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4</a>), with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. prefixed after a verb of fearing (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrews Synt.,' &sect; 336). <span class="cmt_word">For I will there make of thee a great nation</span> - literally, <span class="accented">for to a great nation will I put thee there</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-13.htm">Genesis 21:13</a>). Jacob had previously received the injunction, accompanied by the Divine benediction, to be fruitful and multiply (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>). Twice over had it previously been predicted that he should develop into a multitudinous people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). The present promise was an indication that the fulfillment of the prophecy was at band. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-4 Even as to those events and undertakings which appear most joyful, we should seek counsel, assistance, and a blessing from the Lord. Attending on his ordinances, and receiving the pledges of his covenant love, we expect his presence, and that peace which it confers. In all removals we should be reminded of our removal out of this world. Nothing can encourage us to fear no evil when passing through the valley of the shadow of death, but the presence of Christ.</body></html>
