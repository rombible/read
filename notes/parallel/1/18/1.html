AND OVERTHROW OF SODOM.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And the Lord (Jehovah)</span> <span class= "bld">appeared unto him.</span>--No new section could begin in this way, but evidently this is a continuation of the narrative of the circumcision. We thus find a Jehovistic section coupled in the closest way with one which is Elohistic (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/17-22.htm" title="And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.">Genesis 17:22-23</a>); and even here it is Elohim who for Abraham's sake delivers Lot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelled.">Genesis 19:29</a>). Far more important, however, is it to notice that this familiar intercourse, and clear revelation of Jehovah to Abraham, follows upon his closer relation to God by virtue of the sacrament of circumcision. Jewish tradition adds that this visit was made to Abraham on the third day after the rite had been performed, and was for the purpose of healing him from the painful consequences of it. It was on this account, as they think, that Abraham was resting at home, instead of being with his herds in the field.<p><span class= "bld">The plains (Heb., <span class= "ital">the oaks</span>)</span> <span class= "bld">of Mamre.</span>--(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm" title="Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm" title="And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelled in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.">Genesis 14:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The tent door.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the opening of the tent, </span>formed by looping back one of the curtains.<p><span class= "bld">The heat of the day.</span>--The time of noon, when Orientals rest from labour (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm" title="And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.">Genesis 3:8</a>).

The absence of Abraham's name has been thought to favor the idea that the present chapter should have begun at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a> (Quarry). That the time of this renewed Divine manifestation was shortly after the incidents recorded in the preceding chapter is apparent, as also that its object was the reassurance of the patriarch concerning the birth of Isaac. <span class="cmt_word">In the plains of Mamre.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in the oaks of Mature</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he sat in the tent door.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in the opening of the tent</span>, a fold of which was fastened to a post near by to admit any air that might be stirring. <span class="cmt_word">In the heat of the day</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> noontide (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>), as the cool of the day, or the wind of the day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), means eventide.

Among the Orientals the hour of noon is the time of rest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-7.htm">Song of Solomon 1:7</a>) and the time of dinner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-16.htm">Genesis 43:16, 25</a>). In this case the patriarch had probably dined and was resting after dinner, sines, on the arrival of his visitors, preparations had to be commenced for their entertainment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Abraham was waiting to entertain any weary traveller, for inns were not to be met with as among us. While Abraham was thus sitting, he saw three men coming. These were three heavenly beings in human bodies. Some think they were all created angels; others, that one of them was the Son of God, the Angel of the covenant. Washing the feet is customary in those hot climates, where only sandals are worn. We should not be forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares, Heb 13:2; nay, the Lord of angels himself; as we always do, when for his sake we entertain the least of his brethren. Cheerful and obliging manners in showing kindness, are great ornaments to piety. Though our condescending Lord vouchsafes not personal visits to us, yet still by his Spirit he stands at the door and knocks; when we are inclined to open, he deigns to enter; and by his gracious consolations he provides a rich feast, of which we partake with him, Re 3:20.</body></html>
