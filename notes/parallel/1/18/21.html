But the ellipse is harsh; and inquiry, the knowing and not the punishing, is the prominent thought in the words of Jehovah. Hence too the last clause, "I will know." The two angels go to Sodom to give the people a final trial. If they meet with upright treatment, then God will know that there are limits to the wickedness of its inhabitants, and it will be spared.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will go down now</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and see</span> (judicial investigation ever precedes judicial infliction at the Divine tribunal) <span class="cmt_word">whether they have done altogether</span> - literally, <span class="accented">whether they have made cow, piousness, i.e.</span> carried their iniquity to perfection, to the highest pitch of wickedness (Calvin, Delitzsch, Keil); <span class="cmt_word">or consummated their wickedness, by carrying it to that pitch of fullness which works death</span> (Ainsworth, Kalisch, Rosenm&uuml;ller). The received rendering, which regards <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> as an adverb, has the authority of Luther and Gesenius - according to the cry of it, which has come unto me; and if not, I will know. The LXX. render <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;</span>, meaning, "should it not be so, I will still go down, that I may ascertain the exact truth;" the Chaldee paraphrases, "and if they repent, I will not exact punishment." The entire verse is anthropomorphic, and designed to express the Divine solicitude that the strictest justice should characterize all his dealings both with men and nations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:16-22 The two who are supposed to have been created angels went toward Sodom. The one who is called Jehovah throughout the chapter, continued with Abraham, and would not hide from him the thing he intended to do. Though God long forbears with sinners, from which they fancy that the Lord does not see, and does not regard; yet when the day of his wrath comes, he will look toward them. The Lord will give Abraham an opportunity to intercede with him, and shows him the reason of his conduct. Consider, as a very bright part of Abraham's character and example, that he not only prayed with his family, but he was very careful to teach and rule them well. Those who expect family blessings must make conscience of family duty. Abraham did not fill their heads with matters of doubtful dispute; but he taught them to be serious and devout in the worship of God, and to be honest in their dealings with all men. Of how few may such a character be given in our days! How little care is taken by masters of families to ground those under them in the principles of religion! Do we watch from sabbath to sabbath whether they go forward or backward?</body></html>
