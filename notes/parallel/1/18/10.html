"When the season revives" = next spring, is entirely remote from Oriental thought, and the rendering of Zunz "at the living time" is poetical, but meaningless. The true rendering is probably "a year hence," as when the year is over it dies, and a new year lives in its place. Jewish tradition is strongly in favour of this view, translating "according to this time next year," and adding that the season was the Passover. The only other tenable rendering is "in course of time."<p><span class= "bld">Which was behind him.</span>--The LXX. has a preferable reading, <span class= "ital">and she was behind it. </span>The door, as we have seen, was an opening made by looping back the curtain, which would effectually conceal Sarah's person.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span> (the Principal Guest, as above, who, by the very nature and terms of his announcement, identifies himself with Jehovah), <span class="cmt_word">I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">at the time reviving</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the year shall have been renewed, in the next year, or rather spring (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald, 'Hebrews Synt.,' &sect; 337; Rosenm&uuml;ller, Drusius, Keil, Kalisch, Lange, Ainsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary'); though other interpretations of the phrase have been suggested, as, e.g., "according to the time of that which is born," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the end of nine months (Willet, Calvin, Bush, Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son</span>.

Note the answer, In the tent. Just at hand, in her proper place, occupied in her household concerns. There is nothing got by gadding. Those are most likely to receive comfort from God and his promises, who are in their proper place, and in the way of their duty, Lu 2:8. We are slow of heart to believe, and need line upon line to the same purport. The blessings others have from common providence, believers have from the Divine promise, which makes them very sweet, and very sure. The spiritual seed of Abraham owe their life, and joy, and hope, and all, to the promise. Sarah thinks this too good news to be true; she laughed, and therefore cannot as yet find in her heart to believe it. Sarah laughed. We might not have thought there was a difference between Sarah's laughter and Abraham's, ch. 17:17; but He who searches the heart, saw that the one sprung from unbelief, and the other from faith. She denied that she had laughed. One sin commonly brings in another, and it is not likely we shall strictly keep to truth, when we question the Divine truth. But whom the Lord loves he will rebuke, convict, silence, and bring to repentance, and if they sin before him.</body></html>
