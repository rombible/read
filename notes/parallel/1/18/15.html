but it was the inconsistency of fright. Struck with terror at the thought that she had ridiculed the promise of Jehovah, she offers no excuse, but takes refuge, as frightened people are apt to do, in falsehood. Gently reproved, the result was the building-up of her faith, just as Mary's doubt was removed and her faith perfected by the angel's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-34.htm" title="Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?">Luke 1:34-37</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Sarah</span> (who had overheard the conversation, and the charge preferred against her, and who probably now appeared before the stranger) <span class="cmt_word">denied, saying, I laughed not.</span> Sarah s conduct will admit of no other explanation than that which the sacred narrative itself gives. <span class="cmt_word">For she was afraid.</span> The knowledge that her secret thoughts had been deciphered must have kindled in her breast the suspicion that her visitor was none other than Jehovah. With this a sense of guilt would immediately assail her conscience for having cherished even a moment any doubt of the Divine word. In the consequent confusion of soul she tries what ever seems to be the first impulse of detected transgressions, viz., deception (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh</span>. With a directness similar to that which he employed in dealing with the first culprits in the garden, not contending in a multiplicity of <span class="accented">words</span>, but solemnly announcing that what she said was false. The silence of Sarah was an evidence of her conviction; her subsequent conception was a proof of her repentance and forgiveness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 18:16-22 <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:9-15 Where is Sarah thy wife? was asked. Note the answer, In the tent. Just at hand, in her proper place, occupied in her household concerns. There is nothing got by gadding. Those are most likely to receive comfort from God and his promises, who are in their proper place, and in the way of their duty, Lu 2:8. We are slow of heart to believe, and need line upon line to the same purport. The blessings others have from common providence, believers have from the Divine promise, which makes them very sweet, and very sure. The spiritual seed of Abraham owe their life, and joy, and hope, and all, to the promise. Sarah thinks this too good news to be true; she laughed, and therefore cannot as yet find in her heart to believe it. Sarah laughed. We might not have thought there was a difference between Sarah's laughter and Abraham's, ch. 17:17; but He who searches the heart, saw that the one sprung from unbelief, and the other from faith. She denied that she had laughed. One sin commonly brings in another, and it is not likely we shall strictly keep to truth, when we question the Divine truth. But whom the Lord loves he will rebuke, convict, silence, and bring to repentance, and if they sin before him.</body></html>
