Nor must we suppose that he thought only of Lot. Doubtless he remembered the day when he had restored the persons and spoil to the king of Sodom. He had then seen their human affection; the joy of parent meeting with child, and friend with friend; and he hoped that there were good people among them, and that so marvellous a deliverance would work in many of them a true repentance. Neither must we suppose that Abraham adroitly began with a large number, with the intention of lessening it. It was the readiness with which each prayer was heard which made him in his earnestness continue his entreaties. It thus illustrates the principle that the faith of the believer grows strong as he feels that his prayers are accepted, and he ventures finally to offer petitions, nothing wavering, which at an earlier stage would have seemed to him to ask more than he might venture to hope from the Divine goodness.<p><span class= "bld">Destroy.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">sweep away; </span>and so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-24.htm" title="Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?">Genesis 18:24</a>. The difference is not without force; for the verb "to sweep away" gives the idea of a more indiscriminate ruin than the usual word <span class= "ital">destroy, </span>which Abraham substitutes for it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-28.htm" title="Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: will you destroy all the city for lack of five?

The Jonathan Targum explains, "and Abraham prayed." <span class="cmt_word">And said.</span> Commencing the sublimest act of human intercession of which Scripture preserves a record, being moved thereto, if not by an immediate regard for <span class="accented">Lot</span> (Lange), at least by a sense of compassion towards the inhabitants of Sodom, "<span class="accented">communis erga quinque populos misericordia"</span> (Calvin), which was heightened and intensified by his own previous experience of forgiving grace (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</span> The question presupposes that God had, according to the resolution of Ver. 17, explained to the patriarch his intention to destroy the cities of the plain. The object the patriarch contemplated in his intercession was not simply the preservation of any godly remnant that might be found within the doomed towns, but the rescue of their entire populations from the impending judgment, - only he does not at first discover his complete design, perhaps regarding such an absolute reversal of the Divine purpose as exceeding the legitimate bounds of creature supplication; but with what might be characterized as holy adroitness he veils his ulterior aim, and commences his petition at a Point somewhat removed from that to which he hopes to come. Assuming it as settled that the fair Pentapolis is to be destroyed, he practically asks, with a strange mixture of humility and boldness, if Jehovah has considered that this will involve a sad commingling in one gigantic overthrow of both the righteous and the wicked. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:23-33 Here is the first solemn prayer upon record in the Bible; and it is a prayer for the sparing of Sodom. Abraham prayed earnestly that Sodom might be spared, if but a few righteous persons should be found in it. Come and learn from Abraham what compassion we should feel for sinners, and how earnestly we should pray for them. We see here that the effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. Abraham, indeed, failed in his request for the whole place, but Lot was miraculously delivered. Be encouraged then to expect, by earnest prayer, the blessing of God upon your families, your friends, your neighbourhood. To this end you must not only pray, but you must live like Abraham. He knew the Judge of all the earth would do right. He does not plead that the wicked may be spared for their own sake, or because it would be severe to destroy them, but for the sake of the righteous who might be found among them. And righteousness only can be made a plea before God. How then did Christ make intercession for transgressors? Not by blaming the Divine law, nor by alleging aught in extenuation or excuse of human guilt; but by pleading HIS OWN obedience unto death.</body></html>
