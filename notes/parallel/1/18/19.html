And this purpose was, that from Abraham should spring a nation whose institutions were to be fraught with Divine truth, whose prophets were to be the means of revealing God's will to man, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, the Messiah should come. What more fitting than that one appointed to fill so noble a calling should also be raised to the rank of a prophet, and be permitted to share in the Divine counsels? This rendering closely agrees with what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm" title="Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?">Genesis 18:18</a> about Abraham growing into a mighty nation; and it was the unique and high purpose for which this nation was to be called into being which brought Abraham into so close a relation to Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know him, that</span> - literally, for <span class="accented">I have known</span> (or chosen, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> being - <span class="accented">dilexi, as in</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>) <span class="accented">him to the end that (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> conveying the idea of purpose; <span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald, &sect; 357), the language expressing the idea that Abraham had been the object of Divine foreknowledge and election (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, Keil, Oehler, Kalisch, Lange), although the reading of the text is substantially adopted by many (LXX., Vulgate, Targums, Luther, Calvin, Dathe, et <span class="accented">alii</span>). The latter interpretation assigns as the reason of the Divine communication the knowledge which Jehovah then possessed of Abraham's piety; the former grounds the Divine resolution on the prior fact that Divine grace had elected him to the high destiny described in the language following. It is generally agreed that this clause connects with Ver. 17; Bush regards it as exhibiting the means by which the future promised to Abraham in Ver. 18 should be realized - <span class="cmt_word">he will</span> (rather, may) <span class="cmt_word">command his children and his household after him</span> (by parental authority as well as by personal example), <span class="cmt_word">and they shall keep</span> (rather, <span class="accented">that they may keep</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the way of the Lord</span>, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the religion of Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-22.htm">2 Kings 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-1.htm">Psalm 119:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>), of which the practical outcome is - <span class="cmt_word">to do justice and judgment</span>; - or righteousness and judgment, that which accords with right or the sense of oughtness in intelligent and moral beings, and that which harmonizes with the Divine law (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a>) - that (literally, <span class="accented">to the end that</span>, in order that, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">ut supra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:16-22 The two who are supposed to have been created angels went toward Sodom. The one who is called Jehovah throughout the chapter, continued with Abraham, and would not hide from him the thing he intended to do. Though God long forbears with sinners, from which they fancy that the Lord does not see, and does not regard; yet when the day of his wrath comes, he will look toward them. The Lord will give Abraham an opportunity to intercede with him, and shows him the reason of his conduct. Consider, as a very bright part of Abraham's character and example, that he not only prayed with his family, but he was very careful to teach and rule them well. Those who expect family blessings must make conscience of family duty. Abraham did not fill their heads with matters of doubtful dispute; but he taught them to be serious and devout in the worship of God, and to be honest in their dealings with all men. Of how few may such a character be given in our days! How little care is taken by masters of families to ground those under them in the principles of religion! Do we watch from sabbath to sabbath whether they go forward or backward?</body></html>
