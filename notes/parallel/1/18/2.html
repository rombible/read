More correctly one was "the angel of Jehovah," who came as the manifestation of Deity to Abraham, and the other two were his companions, commissioned by him afterwards to execute judgment on the cities of the plain, The number three pointed also to the Trinity of Persons in the Godhead, and is therefore read by our Church as one of the lessons for Trinity Sunday. But we must be careful not to use it as a proof of this doctrine, lest the inference should be drawn of a personal appearance of the Father and of the Holy Ghost, which would savour of heretical impiety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him.</span> Not in addition to (Kalisch), but including (Keil), Jehovah, whose appearance to the patriarch, having in the previous verse been first generally stated, is now minutely described. That these three men were not manifestations of the three persons of the Godhead (Justin Martyr, Ambrose, Cyril), but Jehovah accompanied by two created angels (Keil, <span class="accented">et alii</span>, may be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>. When first perceived by the patriarch they were believed to be men, strangers, who were approaching his tent, and indeed were already close to it, or standing by him. <span class="cmt_word">And when he saw them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> understood that one of them was Jehovah, Jarchi rightly explaining that the word translated above "looked," i.e. with the bodily vision now implies an act of mental perception), <span class="cmt_word">he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground</span>. The expression denotes the complete prostration of the body by first falling on the knees, and then inclining the head forwards till it touches the ground. As this was a mode of salutation practiced by Orientals towards superiors generally, such as kings and princes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>), but also towards equals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-6.htm">Genesis 33:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-26.htm">Genesis 43:26</a>), as well as towards the Deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), it is impossible to affirm with certainty (Keil, Lunge) that an act of worship was intended by the patriarch, and not simply the presentation of human and civil honor (Calvin). If <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> inclines to countenance the latter interpretation, the language in which Abraham immediately addresses one of the three men almost leads to the conclusion that already the patriarch had recognized Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Abraham was waiting to entertain any weary traveller, for inns were not to be met with as among us. While Abraham was thus sitting, he saw three men coming. These were three heavenly beings in human bodies. Some think they were all created angels; others, that one of them was the Son of God, the Angel of the covenant. Washing the feet is customary in those hot climates, where only sandals are worn. We should not be forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares, Heb 13:2; nay, the Lord of angels himself; as we always do, when for his sake we entertain the least of his brethren. Cheerful and obliging manners in showing kindness, are great ornaments to piety. Though our condescending Lord vouchsafes not personal visits to us, yet still by his Spirit he stands at the door and knocks; when we are inclined to open, he deigns to enter; and by his gracious consolations he provides a rich feast, of which we partake with him, Re 3:20.</body></html>
