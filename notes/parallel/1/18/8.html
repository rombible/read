For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.">Judges 13:16</a>). There is the same mystery as regards our risen Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-43.htm" title="And he took it, and did eat before them.">Luke 24:43</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took butter</span>, - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span>, to curdle or become thick, signifies curdled milk, not butter (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">butyrum</span>, Vulgate), which was not used among Orientals except medicinally. The word occurs seven times in Scripture with four letters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>, .22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-33.htm">Proverbs 30:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm">Job 20:17</a>), and once without <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Michaelis, 'Supplement,' p. 807) - <span class="cmt_word">and milk</span>, - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, milk whilst still fresh, or containing its fatness, from a root signifying to be fat (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-12.htm">Genesis 49:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and the calf which he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the young man - <span class="cmt_word">had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree</span>, - a custom still observed among the Arabs, who honor their guests not by sitting to eat with, but by standing to wait upon, them - <span class="cmt_word">and they did eat</span>. Not seemed to eat (Josephus, Philo, Jonathan), nor simply ate after an allegorical fashion, as fire consumes the materials put into it (Justin Martyr), but did so in reality (Tertullian, Delitzsch, Keil, Kurtz, Lange). Though the angel who appeared to Manoah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>) refused to partake of food, the risen Savior ate with his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-43.htm">Luke 24:43</a>). Physiologically inexplicable, this latter action on the part of Christ was not a mere <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or simulation, but a veritable manducation of material food, to which Christ appealed in confirmation of the reality of his resurrection; and the acceptance of Abraham's hospitality on the part of Jehovah and his angels may in like manner have been designed to prove that their visit to his tent at Mamre was not a dream or a vision, but a genuine external manifestation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Abraham was waiting to entertain any weary traveller, for inns were not to be met with as among us. While Abraham was thus sitting, he saw three men coming. These were three heavenly beings in human bodies. Some think they were all created angels; others, that one of them was the Son of God, the Angel of the covenant. Washing the feet is customary in those hot climates, where only sandals are worn. We should not be forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares, Heb 13:2; nay, the Lord of angels himself; as we always do, when for his sake we entertain the least of his brethren. Cheerful and obliging manners in showing kindness, are great ornaments to piety. Though our condescending Lord vouchsafes not personal visits to us, yet still by his Spirit he stands at the door and knocks; when we are inclined to open, he deigns to enter; and by his gracious consolations he provides a rich feast, of which we partake with him, Re 3:20.</body></html>
