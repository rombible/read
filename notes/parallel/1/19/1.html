This personal respect had made him close his eyes to the sinfulness of the people, and he had consented to live inside the town, and even to let its citizens marry his daughters. Meanwhile all intercourse between him and Abraham apparently had ceased, and he had lost all share in the covenant of circumcision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came two angels</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the two angels</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the two men of the preceding chapter who accompanied Jehovah to Mature; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">to Sodom at even</span> (having left the tent of Abraham shortly after noon); <span class="cmt_word">and Lot</span> - last heard of in the narrative as captured by the Asiatic kings, and delivered by his uncle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-12.htm">Genesis 14:12, 16</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">sat in the gate of Sodom</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, from the idea of opening, signified the gateway or entrance of a camp (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26, 27</a>), of a palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a>), of a temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>), of a land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>), or of a city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>). Corresponding to the ancient forum of the Romans, or agora of the Greeks, the city gate among the Hebrews was the customary place of resort for the settlement of disputes, the transaction of business, or the enjoyment of ordinary social intercourse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). It was probably an arch with deep recesses, in which were placed chairs for the judges or city magistrates, and seats or benches for the citizens who had business to transact. So Homer describes the Trojan elders as sitting at the Scaean gate (3. 148). In what capacity Lot was sitting in the gate is not narrated. That he was on the outlook for travelers on whom to practice the hospitality he had learned from his uncle (Peele, Calvin, Willet, Lange) is perhaps to form too high an ideal of his piety (Kalisch); while the explanation that he had been pro-meted to the dignity of one of the city judges, though not perhaps justified as an inference from Ver. 9, is not at all unlikely, considering his relationship to Abraham. <span class="cmt_word">And Lot seeing them</span> (and recognizing them to be strangers by their dress and looks) <span class="cmt_word">rose up to meet them</span>; - having not yet abandoned the practice of hospitality, or forgotten, through mingling with the Sodomites, the respectful courtesy which was due to strangers, since the writer adds - <span class="cmt_word">and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-29 Lot was good, but there was not one more of the same character in the city. All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.</body></html>
