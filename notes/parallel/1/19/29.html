Hence, as a fragment of the original Elohist's composition, the present verse is by the pseudo-criticism connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-27.htm">Genesis 17:27</a> (Ilgen, Tuch, Block); but "a greater abruptness of style and a more fragmentary mode of composition" than this would indicate "could not easily be imagined" (Kalisch). The change in the Divine name is sufficiently explained by the supposition that the destruction of the cities of the plain was not at the moment viewed by the writer in its connection with the Abrahamic covenant and intercession, but as a sublime vindication of Divine justice (cf. Quarry, p. 444) - <span class="cmt_word">destroyed</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">he destroying, by Elohim</span>, or in Elohim s destroying) <span class="cmt_word">the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham.</span> If the narrative containing the intercession of Abraham and the overthrow of Sodom was due to the Jehovist, how came the earlier author to know anything about those events? The obvious allusions to them in the present verse could only have been made by one acquainted with them. Either, therefore, the present verse proceeded from the hand of the so-called Jehovist, or it requires explanation how in the original document this should be the first and only occasion on which they are referred to (cf. Quarry, p. 445). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> - in answer to Abatham's prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow</span> (there is no reason to suppose that Abraham was aware of his nephew's escape), <span class="cmt_word">when he overthrew</span> - literally, <span class="accented">in the overthrowing of the cities</span>, the inf. being construed with the case of its verb (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, &sect; 133) - <span class="cmt_word">the cities in the which -</span> one of which (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-7.htm">Judges 15:7</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Lot dwelt.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-29 Lot was good, but there was not one more of the same character in the city. All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.</body></html>
