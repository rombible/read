More correctly Calvin takes it as an emphatic reiteration of its being Jehovah's act. Jehovah had mysteriously manifested Himself upon earth by the visit of the three angels to Abraham, but His activity on earth is one with His willing in heaven.<p><span class= "bld">Brimstone and fire.</span>--Though God used natural agencies in the destruction of the Ciccar cities, yet what was in itself a catastrophe of nature became miraculous by the circumstances which surrounded it. It was thus made the means not merely of executing the Divine justice, of strengthening Abraham's faith, and of warning Lot, but also of giving moral and religious instruction throughout all time. Seen by its light, events of history, for which sufficient secondary causes may be discovered, are nevertheless shown to be direct manifestations of the Divine justice, and to have moral causes as their real basis. We lose the benefit of the teaching of the Bible if we suppose that the events recorded there were different in kind from those which take place now. A certain limited number of events were so; but of most it is simply the curtain that is drawn back, and we see God's presence no longer veiled, as with us, but openly revealed. As for the catastrophe itself, it was not a mere thunderstorm which set the earth, saturated with naphtha, on fire; but, in a region where earthquakes are still common, there was apparently an outburst of volcanic violence, casting forth blazing bitumen and brimstone. This falling down upon the houses, and upon the soil charged with combustible matter, caused a conflagration so sudden and widespread that few or none could escape. Sulphur and nitre are still found as natural products on the shores of the Dead Sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the Lord rained</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and Jehovah caused it to rain</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span> (LXX.), which latter term is adopted by Luke in describing this event (Genesis 17:29) - <span class="cmt_word">upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah</span> - and also upon Admah and Zeboim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>), Bela, or Zoar, of the five cities of the Jordan circle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2, 8</a>) being exempted - <span class="cmt_word">brimstone and fire</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>; properly pitch, though the name was afterwards transferred to other inflammable materials (Gesenius); <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and fire, which, though sometimes used of lightning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10, 12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>, may here describe a different sort of igneous agency. Whether this Divinely-sent rain was "burning pitch" (Keil), of lightning which ignited the bituminous soil (Clericus), or a volcanic eruption which overwhelmed all the region (Lynch, Kitto), it was clearly miraculous in its nature, and designed as a solemn punitive infliction on the cities of the plain - <span class="cmt_word">from the Lord</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (the Son) <span class="cmt_word">rained down from Jehovah</span> (the Father), as if suggesting a distinction of persons in the Godhead (Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Athanasius, <span class="accented">et alii</span>, Delitzsch, Lunge, Wordsworth); otherwise the phrase is regarded as "an elegancy of speech" (Aben Ezra), "an emphatic repetition" (Calvin), a more exact characterization of the storm (Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller) as being <span class="cmt_word">out of heaven.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-29 Lot was good, but there was not one more of the same character in the city. All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.</body></html>
