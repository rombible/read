It is a striking proof of the vigour of the race of Terah, that from this lone cavern, and after the loss of all the wealth possessed by Lot, these two children were able to reduce to obedience the aborigines dwelling on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, and establish petty kingdoms there.

The same is the father of the Moabites - who originally inhabited the country northeast of the Dead Sea, between the Jabbok and the Arnon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>), but were afterwards driven by the Amorites south of the Arnou - unto this day. This phrase, indicating a variable period from a few years to a few centuries (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-13.htm">Genesis 48:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-39.htm">Numbers 22:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-3.htm">Joshua 22:3</a>), cannot be regarded as a trace of post-Mosaic authorship (De Wette, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), since in Genesis it is always used of events which had taken place several centuries before the time of Moses, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-33.htm">Genesis 26:33</a>; 35:30; 47:26 (cf. Heil, 'Introduction,' part 1. &sect; 2, div. 1, &sect; 33). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:30-38 See the peril of security. Lot, who kept chaste in Sodom, and was a mourner for the wickedness of the place, and a witness against it, when in the mountain, alone, and, as he thought, out of the way of temptation, is shamefully overtaken. Let him that thinks he stands high, and stands firm, take heed lest he fall. See the peril of drunkenness; it is not only a great sin itself, but lets in many sins, which bring a lasting wound and dishonour. Many a man does that, when he is drunk, which, when he is sober, he could not think of without horror. See also the peril of temptation, even from relations and friends, whom we love and esteem, and expect kindness from. We must dread a snare, wherever we are, and be always upon our guard. No excuse can be made for the daughters, nor for Lot. Scarcely any account can be given of the affair but this, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? From the silence of the Scripture concerning Lot henceforward, learn that drunkenness, as it makes men forgetful, so it makes them to be forgotten.</body></html>
