The utter degradation of Lot and his family is the most painful part of his story, which thus ends in his intense shame.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come, let us make our father drink wine</span>, - either, therefore, Lot had not left Sodom totally unprovided (Inglis), or some little time had elapsed after his escaping to the mountain cave, since his daughters are provided with this intoxicating beverage - <span class="cmt_word">and we will He with him.</span> Considering the town in which the daughters of Lot had been reared, the mother of whom they were the offspring, and the example they had received from their father (Ver. 8), "we can understand, though we cannot cease to abhor, their incestuous conduct" (Kalisch). Their proposal was revolting and unnatural in the extreme. By subsequent Mosaic legislation a transgression of such enormity was rendered punishable by death. Even in the present instance the perpetrators were not wholly unconscious of the wickedness of their conduct. The fact that they required a stratagem for the attainment of their purpose shows that at least they could not calculate on their father's approbation. The entire story has been regarded as the invention of later Jewish hatred to the Moabites and Ammonites (De Wette), a conjecture believed by some to be " not improbable (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but if so, how should the same writer exhibit Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>) as filled with compassionate tenderness towards the cities of the plain? (Havernick). <span class="cmt_word">That we may preserve seed of our father.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">quicken or vivify seed</span> (cf. Ver. 34). Lot's daughters may be credited with whatever virtue may be supposed to reside in this motive for their conduct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:30-38 See the peril of security. Lot, who kept chaste in Sodom, and was a mourner for the wickedness of the place, and a witness against it, when in the mountain, alone, and, as he thought, out of the way of temptation, is shamefully overtaken. Let him that thinks he stands high, and stands firm, take heed lest he fall. See the peril of drunkenness; it is not only a great sin itself, but lets in many sins, which bring a lasting wound and dishonour. Many a man does that, when he is drunk, which, when he is sober, he could not think of without horror. See also the peril of temptation, even from relations and friends, whom we love and esteem, and expect kindness from. We must dread a snare, wherever we are, and be always upon our guard. No excuse can be made for the daughters, nor for Lot. Scarcely any account can be given of the affair but this, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? From the silence of the Scripture concerning Lot henceforward, learn that drunkenness, as it makes men forgetful, so it makes them to be forgotten.</body></html>
