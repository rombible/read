The cities of the plain are commonly believed to have been situated at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, The principal reasons assigned for this conclusion may be stated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Josephus and Jerome, the one representing Jewish, and the other Christian, tradition, both speak of a Zoar as existing in that locality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The difference of level between the northern and southern ends of the lake, the one according to Lynch being 1300 feet, and the other not more than 16 feet, seems to favor the idea that the latter is of recent formation, having been, in fact, submerged at the time of the overthrow of the cities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A ridge of rock-salt on the west of the Yale of Salt is called by the name <span class="accented">Jebel Usdum, in</span> which a trace of the word Sodom is by some detected; and the pillars of salt that in that region have from time to time been detached from the salt cliffs have been designated by the name of Lot's wife (<span class="accented">Bint Sheikh Lot</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a> appears to imply that the Salt Sea now covers what was originally the vale of Siddim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The expression "like the land of Egypt as thou comest to Zoar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>) is suggestive rather of the southern than of the northern extremity of the lake as the site of the Pentapolis. It may be added that this opinion has received the sanction of Robinson, Stanley, Porter, Thomson (The Land and the Book), and other eminent geographers. On the other hand, there are reasons for believing that the true site of the cities was at the north, and not the south, of the Dead Sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The circle of the Jordan was visible from the Bethel plateau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>); the southern extremity of the Dead Sea is not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> From the heights above Hebron or Mature, though the actual circle is not visible, "yet the depression between the nearer hills and those of Gilead can be perceived, and Abraham could at once identify the locality whence the smoke arose," after Sodom's burning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Chedorlaomer's route (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7-14</a>) was from Kadesh to Hazezon-tamar, midway up the western shore of the Dead Sea, from Hazezon-tamar to the vale of Siddim, and from Siddim to Dan, the natural conclusion being that on reaching Hazezon-tamar he did not turn southward, but continued marching northwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Moses from Mount Nebo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>) beheld"' the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar," which was certainly possible if Zoar was in the line of vision with the plain and the city of Jericho, but as certainly impossible if it was at the southern extremity of the lake This view has been advocated by Grove (Smith's 'Biblical Dictionary,' art.

All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.</body></html>
