It now appears that it was the property of the Hittites, a race who, while the Israelites sojourned in Egypt, became so powerful as to contend for empire with the Egyptians themselves. Their capital was Emesa in Northern Syria, and their history is now being made known to us not only by means of Egyptian records, but also of inscriptions in their own language (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm" title="And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,">Genesis 10:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham stood up</span> - during the days of mourning he had been sitting on the ground; and now, his grief having moderated (Calvin), he goes out to the city gate - <span class="cmt_word">from before</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from over the face</span> of) <span class="cmt_word">his dead</span>, - "Sarah, though dead, was still his" (Wordsworth) - <span class="cmt_word">and spake unto the sons of Heth</span>. - the Hittites were descendants of Heth, the son of Canaan (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>). Cf.

Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.</body></html>
