where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)">Numbers 13:22</a>), probably by a tribe of Semites on their way to the Delta. It lies upon the very border of the Negeb of Judah, about twenty-two miles south of Jerusalem. Originally it was named Kirjath-arba, and though Arba is called "the father of Anak" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm" title="And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.">Joshua 15:13</a>), yet the literal meaning <span class= "ital">City of Four </span>(arba being the Hebrew numeral <span class= "ital">four</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>coupled with the fact that Hebron means <span class= "ital">alliance </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm" title="Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.">Genesis 13:18</a>), suggests that its building was the result of the union of four families; and afterwards, from the name of the city, Arba may have been often used as a proper name. At the conquest of Palestine there were descendants of Anak still dwelling there, and apparently they had restored the old title, but were expelled by Caleb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-14.htm" title="And Caleb drove there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.">Joshua 15:14</a>), who took it as his possession, and seems to have given its name to a grandchild, as a memorial of his victory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm" title="Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron.">1Chronicles 2:42</a>). It is still an important town, with a population of 17,000 Moslems and about 600 Jews.<p><span class= "bld">Abraham came to mourn.</span>--At this period Abraham was in quiet possession of several headquarters, and apparently was himself at Beer-sheba when Sarah died at Hebron, where probably he had left Isaac in charge of his mother and the cattle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba</span> - or city of Arba, Abraham having again removed thither after an absence of nearly forty years, during which interval Murphy thinks the reign of Arba the Anakite may have commenced, though Keil postpones it to a later period (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The same is Hebron</span> - the Original name of the city, which was supplanted by that of Kir-jath-arba, but restored at the conquest (Keil, Hengstenberg, Murphy; vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>) <span class="cmt_word">in the land of Canaan</span> - indicating that the writer was not then in Palestine ('Speaker's Commentary'); perhaps rather designed to emphasize the circumstance that Sarah's death occurred not in the Philistines' country, but in the promised land (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham came</span> - or went; <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">venit</span> (Vulgate); not as if he had been absent at her death (Calvin), either in Beersheba, where he retained a location (Clarke), or in Gerar, whither he had gone to sell the lands and other properties he held there (Luther), or in the pasture grounds adjoining Hebron (Keil, Murphy)'; but as addressing himself to the work of mourning for his deceased wife (Vatablus, Rosenm&uuml;ller), or perhaps as going into Sarah's tent (Maimonides, Ainsworth, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary') - <span class="cmt_word">to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</span> "<span class="accented">To</span> arrange for the customary mourning ceremony" (Keil); the first verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>), referring to the beating of the breast as a sign of grief (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-13.htm">1 Kings 14:13</a>); and the second, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to flow by drops, intimating a quieter and more moderate sorrow. Beyond sitting on the ground and weeping in presence of (or upon the face of) the dead, no other rites are mentioned as having been observed by Abraham; though afterwards, as practiced among the Hebrews, Egyptians, and other nations of antiquity, mourning for the dead developed into an elaborate ritual, including such ceremonies as rending the garments, shaving the head, wearing sackcloth, covering the head with dust and ashes (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15, 16</a>). Cf. the mourning for Patroclus ('Il.,' 19:211-213). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-13 The longest life must shortly come to a close. Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.</body></html>
