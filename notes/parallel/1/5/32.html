It is remarkable also that neither of the three sons who were with him in the ark had offspring until after the flood. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-19.htm" title="And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.">Genesis 11:19</a>.) From them have sprung the three great lines into which the human family is divided. Shem means <span class= "ital">name: </span>that is, fame, glory; and he, as the owner of the birthright, was the progenitor of our Lord. Ham, the <span class= "ital">dark-coloured, </span>was the ancestor of the Egyptians, Cushites, and other black races of Arabia and Africa. Japheth, the <span class= "ital">widener, </span>but according to others the <span class= "ital">fair, </span>though the youngest son, was the ancestor of most of the races of Europe, as well as of some of the chief nations of Asia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Noah was five hundred years old</span>. Literally, a son of 500 years, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> going in his 500th year (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-6.htm">Genesis 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1</a>). The son of a year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>) means "strictly within the first year of the life" (Ainsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And Noah begat</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> began to beget (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Shem</span>, - name (Gesenius), fame (Furst) - <span class="cmt_word">Ham</span>, <span class="accented">- chain</span>; hot (Gesenius, Murphy), dark-colored (Furst) - <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">Japheth</span> - spreading (Gesenius, Murphy); beautiful, denoting the white-colored race (Furst). That the sons are mentioned in the order of their ages (Knobel, Kalisch, Keil, Colenso) may seem to be deducible <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the fact that they usually stand in this order (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-10.htm">Genesis 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-18.htm">Genesis 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-4.htm">1 Chronicles 1:4</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the circumstance that it is commonly the eldest son's birth which is stated in the preceding list, though this is open to doubt; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>, which, according to Calvin, Knobel, Keil, and others, describes Shem as Japheth's elder brother; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a>, which, according to Keil, affirms Ham to be the younger son of Noah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-31</a>, in which the order is reversed, but not otherwise altered. But there is reason to believe that Japheth was the eldest and Ham the youngest of the patriarch's children (Michaelis, Clarke, Murphy, Wordsworth, Quarry). According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10</a> Shem was born 97 years before the Flood, while (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>) Noah was 600 years old at the time of the Flood. Hence, if Noah began to beget children in his 500th year, and Shem was born in Noah's 503rd year, the probability is that the firstborn son was Japheth. In accordance with this <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a> is understood by LXX., Vulgate, Michaelis, Lange, Quarry, and others to assert the priority in respect of age of Japheth. In the narrative ahem is placed first as being spiritually, though not physically, the firstborn. Ranke perceives in the mention of the three sons an indication that each was subsequently "to lay the foundation of a new beginning." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN. The chronology of the present chapter represents man as having been in existence at the time of the Deluge exactly 1656 years. According to the Septuagint, which Josephus follows except in one particular (the age of Lamech), and which proceeds, again with two exceptions (the age of Jared, which it leaves untouched, and that of Lamech, which it increases by six), upon the principle of adding 100 to the Hebrew numbers, the age of man at the date of that catastrophe was 2262 (<span class="accented">vide</span> Chronological Table). The dates of the Samaritan Pentateuch, being manifestly incorrect, need not be considered. Adding to the above dates the subsequent chronological periods from the Deluge to the call of Abram (Hebrew, 367; LXX, 1017), from the call of Abram to the exodus from Egypt (430 years according to one calculation, LXX.; 730 according to another, Kalisch), from the exodus to the birth of Christ (1645, Hales; 1593, Jackson; 1491, Ussher; 1531, Petavius; 1320, Bunsen), the antiquity of man, according to the Biblical account, is not less than 5652 and not more than 7536 years. The conclusion thus reached, however, is somewhat scornfully repudiated by modern science, as affording, on either alter. native, an altogether inadequate term of existence for the human race. 1. The evidence of geology is supposed irrefragably to attest that man must have been upon the earth at least 1000 centuries, and probably ten times as long (Wallace on 'Natural Selection,' p. 303). The data for this deduction, as stated by Sir Charles Lyell, are chiefly the discovery, in recent and post Pliocene formations of alleged great antiquity, of fossil human remains and flint implements along with bones of the mammoth and other animals long since extinct ('Antiquity of Man,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. - 19.). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "So far as research has been prosecuted in the different quarters of the globe, no remains of man or of his works have been discovered till we come to the lake-silts, the peat-mosses, the river-gravels, and the cave-earths of the post-tertiary period," which seems at least an indirect confirmation of the Biblical record. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The tree canoes, stone hatchets, flint implements, and occasional fragments of the human skeleton," upon which so much is based, "<span class="accented">have</span> been chiefly discovered within the limited area of Southern and Western Europe," while "we have scarcely any information from the corresponding deposits of other regions;" consequently, "till these other regions shall have been examined - and especially Asia, where man flourished long prior to his civilization in Europe - it were premature to hazard any opinion as to man's first appearance on the globe." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "It is true that the antiquity of some of the containing deposits, especially the river drifts, is open to question, and it is also quite possible that the remains of the extinct quadrupeds may in some instances have been reasserted from older accumulations." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Historically we have no means of arriving at the age of these deposits; geologically we can only <span class="accented">approximate</span> the time by comparison with existing operations; while palaeontologically - the differences between these extinct pachyderms and those still existing are not greater than that which appears between the several living species, and would therefore indicate no great palaeontological antiquity - nothing that may not have taken place within a few thousand years of the ordinarily received chronology" (Page on 'The Philosophy of Geology,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. pp. 114-117). With these undesigned replies from a late eminent authority in geological science, the Bible student will do well to pause before displacing the currently-received age of man by the fabulous duration claimed for him by the first-named writers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:25-32 Methuselah signifies, 'he dies, there is a dart,' 'a sending forth,' namely, of the deluge, which came the year that Methuselah died. He lived 969 years, the longest that any man ever lived on earth; but the longest liver must die at last. Noah signifies rest; his parents gave him that name, with a prospect of his being a great blessing to his generation. Observe his father's complaint of the calamitous state of human life, by the entrance of sin, and the curse of sin. Our whole life is spent in labour, and our time filled up with continual toil. God having cursed the ground, it is as much as some can do, with the utmost care and pains, to get a hard livelihood out comfort us. It signifies not only that desire and expectation which parents generally have about their children, that they will be comforts to them and helpers, though they often prove otherwise; but it signifies also a prospect of something more. Is Christ ours? Is heaven ours? We need better comforters under our toil and sorrow, than the dearest relations and the most promising offspring; may we seek and find comforts in Christ.</body></html>
