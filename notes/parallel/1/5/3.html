from <span class="accented">shanah</span>, to fold together, to repeat; hence a year (Gesenius, Furst). Cf. Latin, <span class="accented">annus</span>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; Gothic, <span class="accented">Jar</span>, <span class="accented">jar</span>, <span class="accented">jet</span>; German, jahr; English, <span class="accented">year - all</span> of which "seem to carry the same thought, viz., that which comes again" (T. Lewis). "<span class="accented">Shanah</span> never means month" (Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And begat a son in his own likeness</span>, <span class="accented">- damuth</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">after his image</span> <span class="accented">- tselem</span> (cf. Genesis1:26); not the Divine image in which he was himself created (Kalisch, Knobel, Alford), but the image or likeness of his own fallen nature, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the image of God modified and corrupted by sin (Keil, Murphy, Wordsworth). "A supernatural remedy does not prevent generation from participating in the corruption of sin. Therefore, according to the flesh Seth was born a sinner, though he was afterwards renewed by the Spirit of grace" (Calvin). The doctrine of inherited depravity or transmitted sin has been commonly held to favor the theory which accounts for the origin of the human soul <span class="accented">per traducem</span> (Tertullian, Luther, Delitzsch), in opposition to that which holds it to be due to the creative power of God (Jerome, Augustine, Calvin, Beza, Turretin). Kalisch thinks the statement "Adam begat Seth in his own image ' decisive in favor of Traducianism, while Hodge affirms "it only asserts that Seth was like his father, and sheds no light, on the mysterious process of generation ('Syst. Theol.,' Part I. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. &sect; 2). The truth is that Scripture seems to recognize both sides of this question. <span class="accented">Vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a> in favor of Traducianism, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14-16</a>; Jeremiah L 5 in support of Creationism (cf. Martensen's 'Dogmatics,' &sect; 74), though there is much force in the words of Augustine "De re obscurissima disputatur, non adjuvantibus divinarum scripturarum certis clarisque documentis." <span class="cmt_word">And called his name</span> - probably concurring in the name selected by Eve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Seth</span> - Appointed, placed, substituted; hence compensation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the days of Adam after he had begotten</span> - literally, <span class="accented">his begetting - <span class="cmt_word"></span>Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.</span> "In that primitive time the births did not rapidly follow each other - a fact which had to indicate that his having a posterity at all was conditioned by the ripeness of his faith. At the same time the lateness of paternity among these primeval men may have been partly due to a physical cause as well, "since in exact accordance with the increasing degeneracy and rankness of human life is there, in a literal sense, the increase of a numerous and wretched offspring" (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">And all the days that Adam</span> - not the whole tribe (Gatterer, <span class="accented">vide</span> Bohlen; cf. Balgarnie, 'Expositor,' vol. 8.), "as in this case Enoch must have been taken to heaven with his whole family" (Kalisch); but the individual bearing that name - <span class="cmt_word">lived were nine hundred and thirty years</span>. The remarkable longevity of the Macrobii has been explained - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">On the supposition of its non</span>-<span class="accented">authenticity</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As a purely mythical conception (Knobel, Bauer, Hartmann, Bohlen); which, however, may be safely rejected as an altogether inadequate hypothesis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As due to an error in the traditional transmission of the genealogical registers, several names having fallen out, leaving their years to be reckoned to those that remained (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but against this conjecture stands the orderly succession of father and son through ten generations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> As representing not the lifetimes of individuals, but dynastic epochs (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> as signifying lesser spaces of time - e.g. three months (Hensler), or one month (Raske) - than solar years; but even Knobel admits that "no shorter year have the Hebrews ever had than the period of a year's time." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">On</span> <span class="accented">the basis of its historic credibility</span>; as attributable to - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The original immortality with which man was endowed, and which was now being frayed away by the inroads of sin (Kalisch). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The superior piety and intelligence of these early father's of the race (Josephus, 'Antiq.,' I. 3:9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The influence of the fruit of the tree of life which, while in the garden, Adam ate (Whately, 'Ency. Brit.,' eighth ed., Art. Christianity). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The original vigor of their physical constitutions, and the greater excellence of the food on which they lived (Willet). But if the first and second opinions are correct, then the Cainites should have died earlier than the Sethites, which there is no reason to believe they did; while the third is a pure conjecture (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>), and the fourth may contain some degree of truth. We prefer to ascribe the longevity of these antediluvian men to a distinct exercise of grace on the part of God, who designed it to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a proof of the Divine clemency in suspending the penalty of sin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a symbol of that immortality which had been recovered for men by the promise of the woman's seed; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a medium of transmission for the faith, for the benefit of both the Church and the world. <span class="cmt_word">And he died</span>. "The solemn toll of the patriarchal funeral bell (Bonar). Its constant recurrence at the close of each biography proves the dominion of death from Adam onward, as an immutable law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>; Baumgarten, Kefi, Lange); "warns us that death was not denounced in vain against men" (Calvin); "is a standing demonstration of the effect of disobedience" (Murphy); "was intended to show what the condition of all mankind was after Adam's fall (Willet). The expression is not appended to the genealogical list of the Fathers after the Flood, doubtless as being then sufficiently understood; and it is not said of the descendants of Cain that they died, "as if the inheritance of the sons of God were not here on earth, but in death, as the days of the deaths of martyrs are held in honor by the Church as their birthdays" (Wordsworth). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Adam was made in the image of God; but when fallen he begat a son in his own image, sinful and defiled, frail, wretched, and mortal, like himself. Not only a man like himself, consisting of body and soul, but a sinner like himself. This was the reverse of that Divine likeness in which Adam was made; having lost it, he could not convey it to his seed. Adam lived, in all, 930 years; and then died, according to the sentence passed upon him, To dust thou shalt return. Though he did not die in the day he ate forbidden fruit, yet in that very day he became mortal. Then he began to die; his whole life after was but a reprieve, a forfeited, condemned life; it was a wasting, dying life. Man's life is but dying by degrees.</body></html>
