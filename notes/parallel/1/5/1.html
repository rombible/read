(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the book</span>. <span class="accented">Sepher</span>, a register, a complete writing of any kind, a book, whether consisting of a pair of leaves or of only a single leaf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1, 3</a>; "a bill of divorcement;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-36.htm">Luke 3:36, 38</a>). The expression presupposes the invention of the art of writing. If, therefore, we may conjecture that the original compiler of this ancient document was Noah, than whom no one would be more likely or better qualified than he to preserve some memorial of the lost race of which he and his family were the sole survivors, it affords an additional corroboration of the intelligence and culture of the antediluvian men. It is too frequently taken for granted that the people who could build cities, invent musical instruments, and make songs were unacquainted with the art of writing; and though certainly we cannot affirm that the transmission of such a family register as is here recorded was beyond the capabilities of oral tradition, it is obvious that its preservation would be much more readily secured by some kind of documentary notation. <span class="cmt_word">Of the generations</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> evolutions (<span class="accented">tol'doth</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of Adam</span>.

Not only a man like himself, consisting of body and soul, but a sinner like himself. This was the reverse of that Divine likeness in which Adam was made; having lost it, he could not convey it to his seed. Adam lived, in all, 930 years; and then died, according to the sentence passed upon him, To dust thou shalt return. Though he did not die in the day he ate forbidden fruit, yet in that very day he became mortal. Then he began to die; his whole life after was but a reprieve, a forfeited, condemned life; it was a wasting, dying life. Man's life is but dying by degrees.</body></html>
