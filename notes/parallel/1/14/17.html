Its other name, "the king's dale," may have been given it from this meeting of the kings of Salem and Sodom with the victorious Abram; but Onkelos, with far greater probability, considers that it was so called because upon this level ground the kings of Judah in subsequent times assembled and exercised their forces.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of Sodom</span> - Bera, or his successor (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 10) - <span class="cmt_word">went out to meet him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Abram) <span class="cmt_word">after his return from the slaughter</span> (perhaps too forcible an expression for mere defeat) <span class="cmt_word">of Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him</span> (the entire clause from "after" is parenthetical), <span class="cmt_word">at the valley of Shaveh.</span> A valley about two stadia north of Jerusalem (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:10), supposed to be the valley of the Upper Kedron, where Absalom s pillar was after. wards erected (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-10.htm">2 Samuel 18:10</a>); which may be correct if the Salem afterwards mentioned was Jerusalem (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>); but if it was not, then the exact site of Shaveh must be left undetermined. <span class="cmt_word">Which is the king's dale</span>.

The words of the apostle, Heb 7:3, state only, that the sacred history has said nothing of his ancestors. The silence of the Scriptures on this, is to raise our thoughts to Him, whose generation cannot be declared. Bread and wine were suitable refreshment for the weary followers of Abram; and it is remarkable that Christ appointed the same as the memorials of his body and blood, which are meat and drink indeed to the soul. Melchizedek blessed Abram from God. He blessed God from Abram. We ought to give thanks for other's mercies as for our own. Jesus Christ, our great High Priest, is the Mediator both of our prayers and praises, and not only offers up ours, but his own for us. Abram gave him the tenth of the spoils, Heb 7:4. When we have received some great mercy from God, it is very fit we should express our thankfulness by some special act of pious charity. Jesus Christ, our great Melchisedek, is to have homage done him, and to be humbly acknowledged as our King and Priest; not only the tithe of all, but all we have, must be given up to him.</body></html>
