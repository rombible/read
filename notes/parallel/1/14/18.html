But such traditions are of little value, and we may eel certain that the place was really Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm" title="In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.">Psalm 76:2</a>); for it lay on Abram's route homeward, and was within a reasonable distance of Sodom, which, as we have seen, lay in the Ciccar of Jericho, at the northern end of the Dead Sea. Salem is a common name for towns in Palestine (Conder, <span class= "ital">Tent-work, </span>i. 91), and the village in Ephraim is too remote to have been the place of meeting.<p>In Melchizedek we have a type of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1-21</a>), and so venerable is his character and aspect that Jewish tradition identified him with the patriarch Shem, thus reconciling also to themselves his superiority over their forefather Abraham. But this idea is contradicted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-3.htm" title="Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like to the Son of God; stays a priest continually.">Hebrews 7:3</a>. He was more probably the king of some Semitic race who still occupied Salem, but from whom it was at a subsequent period wrested by the Jebusites, who called it Jebus, after the name of their ancestor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/19-10.htm" title="But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.">Judges 19:10-11</a>). Up to David's days it seems to have still had a titular king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-23.htm" title="All these things did Araunah, as a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD your God accept you.">2Samuel 24:23</a>), and upon his conquest of it its old name reappears, but with a prefix, and henceforward it was known as Jeru-salem, that is (probably), <span class= "ital">the possession of Salem.</span><p>The typical value of Melehizedek's priesthood lies not merely in his being "king of righteousness and king of peace," but even more in his priesthood being universal, limited by no external ordinances, and attached to no particular race or people. Moreover, he is a king-priest (Psalms 110), and by taking precedence of Abram. and blessing him, and receiving of him tithes, he became the representative of a higher priesthood than any that could spring from Abram's loins.<p><span class= "bld">Bread and wine.</span>--The representatives of food of all kinds, both liquid and solid. Though the primary object of this offering was the refreshing of the bodies of Abram's men, and of the prisoners wearied with their long march to and fro, yet we cannot but recognise in it a foreshowing of the bestowal by Christ, the antitype, upon His Church of the spiritual food of His most blessed Body and Blood.<p><span class= "bld">Priest of the most high God.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">of El 'elyon. </span>The mention of the term <span class= "ital">priest </span>(used here for the first time) shows that some sort of sacrificial worship existed at Salem. Sacrifice had, however, been practised before; for Abel had acted as a priest when offering his firstlings, and Abram at the various altars which he built. Apparently, however, Melchizedek had been set apart for the priesthood in some more definite way. <span class= "ital">El 'elyon </span>means "the supreme God," and though the two words are so similar in English, they are altogether unlike in Hebrew. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm" title="I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.">Psalm 7:17</a> the epithet '<span class= "ital">elyon </span>is applied to Jehovah. With that precision in the use of the names of Deity which we have so often noticed before, Melchizedek is described as a priest of <span class= "ital">El 'elyon, </span>the Supreme Ruler of the universe; but Abram swears by <span class= "ital">Jehovah El 'elyon, </span>thus claiming that Jehovah was that Supreme Deity whom Melchizedek served, though without the special knowledge of Him which the patriarch possessed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Melchisedeck</span>.

The capital of Melchisedeck was either Jerusalem, of which the ancient name was Salem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a> (Josephus, Onkelos, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Knobel, Delitzsch, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Bush); or a city on the other side Jordan en <span class="accented">route</span> from Damascus to Sodom (Ewald); or, though less likely, as being too remote from Sodom and the king's dale, Salem in the tribe of Ephraim, a city near Scythopolis, where the ruins of Melchisedeck's palace were said to exist (Jerome), and near to which John baptized (Bochart). <span class="cmt_word">Brought forth bread and wine.</span> As a refreshment to the patriarch and his soldiers (Josephus, Calvin, Clarke, Rosenm&uuml;ller), which, however, was the less necessary since the spoils of the conquered foe were in possession of Abram and his men (Kalisch); hence mainly as a symbol, not of his transference of the soil of Canaan to the patriarch, bread and wine being the chief productions of the ground (Lightfoot), or of his gratitude to Abram, who had recovered for the land peace, freedom, and prosperity (Delitzsch), or of the institution of the Supper by the Lord Jesus Christ (Bush); but of the priestly benediction which followed and of the spiritual refreshment which it conferred upon the soul of Abram (Kalisch, Murphy). The Romish idea, that the act of Melchisedeck was sacrificial, is precluded by the statement that he brought forth the bread and wine before the people, and not before God. <span class="cmt_word">And he was the priest</span>. <span class="accented">Cohen</span>; one who undertakes another's cause, hence one who acts as mediator between God and man, though the primary signification of the root is doubtful and disputed. The necessity for this office has its ground in the sinfulness of man, which disqualifies him for direct intercourse with a holy Being (cf. Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship,' ch. 1. b.). The occurrence of this term, here mentioned for the flint time, implies the existence of a regularly-constituted form of worship by means of priests and sacrifice. Hence the Mosaic cultus afterwards instituted may only have been a resuscitation and further development of what had existed from the beginning. <span class="cmt_word">Of the most high God.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">El-Ellen</span>, a proper name for the Supreme Deity (occurring only here, in the narrative of Abram's interview with the kings); of which the first term, <span class="accented">El</span>, from the same root as Elohim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, q.v.), signifies the Strong One, and is seldom applied to God without some qualifying attribute or cognomen, as El-Shaddai, or El, the God of Israel; and the second, '<span class="accented">Elion</span> (occurring frequently afterwards, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Psalms 9:2), describes God as the High, the Highest, the Exalted, the Supreme, and is sometimes used in conjunction with Jehovah (Psalm. 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), and with Elohim (Psalm 57:3 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 57:2<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), while sometimes it stands alone (Psalm 21:8 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 21:7<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>). Most probably the designation here describes the name under which the Supreme Deity was worshipped by Melchisedeck and the king of Sodom, whom Abram recognizes as followers of the true God by identifying, as in Ver. 22, El-Elion with Jehovah (cf. Quarry, p. 426). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:17-20 Melchizedek is spoken of as a king of Salem, supposed to be the place afterwards called Jerusalem, and it is generally thought that he was only a man. The words of the apostle, Heb 7:3, state only, that the sacred history has said nothing of his ancestors. The silence of the Scriptures on this, is to raise our thoughts to Him, whose generation cannot be declared. Bread and wine were suitable refreshment for the weary followers of Abram; and it is remarkable that Christ appointed the same as the memorials of his body and blood, which are meat and drink indeed to the soul. Melchizedek blessed Abram from God. He blessed God from Abram. We ought to give thanks for other's mercies as for our own. Jesus Christ, our great High Priest, is the Mediator both of our prayers and praises, and not only offers up ours, but his own for us. Abram gave him the tenth of the spoils, Heb 7:4. When we have received some great mercy from God, it is very fit we should express our thankfulness by some special act of pious charity. Jesus Christ, our great Melchisedek, is to have homage done him, and to be humbly acknowledged as our King and Priest; not only the tithe of all, but all we have, must be given up to him.</body></html>
