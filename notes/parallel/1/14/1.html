Genesis, </span>p. 72), from those of Babylon. The latter view is made the more probable by the fact that Amraphel, though but a subject king, is placed first; and the way in which the patriarch is described in it, as "Abram the Hebrew," seems certainly to suggest that we have to do here with a narrative of foreign origin.<p>Its incorporation with the history admirably sets forth the consequences of Lot's choice in the troubles, and even ruin, which overtook him, the bravery and power of Abram, and his generosity to the rescued kings. It is also most interesting, as showing Abram's relation to the Amorites, among whom he lived, and the existence in Palestine of a Semitic population, who still worshipped "the most high God," and over whom one of the noblest figures in the Old Testament was king. The narrative is Jehovistic, for Abram calls God <span class= "ital">Jehovah El Elton, </span>but is, nevertheless, of such ancient date as to forbid the acceptance of the theory which regards the occurrence of the name Jehovah as a proof of later authorship. Upon Elam and the conquests and route of Chedorlaomer, see Excursus at end of this book.<p><span class= "bld">Amraphel.</span>--An Accadian name, which Lenormant has found on Babylonian cylinders, and which he explains as meaning "the circle of the year."<p><span class= "bld">Shinar.</span>--See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Arioch.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., Eriaku, </span>which in Accadian means "servant of the moon-god." He was king of Ellasar, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Al-Larsa, <span class= "ital">the city of Larsa, </span>now called Senkereh. It is situated on the left bank of the Euphrates, in Lower Babylonia, and has contributed some very ancient tablets to the collection in the British Museum. The name occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-14.htm" title="Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:">Daniel 2:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Tidal.</span>--More correctly in the LXX., <span class= "ital">Thargal, </span>that is, Tur-gal. <span class= "ital">the great son </span>(Sayce). In the Syriac he is called "Thargil, king of the Gelae," the latter being a mistake, through reading Gelim for Goim. This word does not mean "nations," but is a proper name, spelt <span class= "ital">Gutium </span>in the inscriptions, "by which the Accadians designated the whole tract of country which extended from the Tigris to the eastern borders of Media, including the district afterwards known as Assyria" (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>p. 197).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass.</span> After the separation of Abram and Lot, the latter of whom now appears as a citizen of Sodom, and not merely a settler in the Jordan circle; perhaps about the eighty-fourth year of Abram's life (Hughes). The present chapter, "the oldest extant record respecting Abraham" (Ewald), but introduced into the Mosaic narrative by the Jehovistic editor (Knobel, Tuch, Bleek, Davidson), possesses traces of authenticity, of which not the least is the chronological definition with which it commences (Havernick). <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Amraphel</span>. Sanscrit, <span class="accented">Amrapala</span>, keeper of the gods (Gesenius); <span class="accented">Arphaxad</span> (Furst); powerful people (Young, 'Analytical Concordance'); root unknown (Murphy, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">King of Skinar</span>. <span class="accented">Babel</span> (Onkelos); Bagdad (Arabic version of Erpenius); <span class="accented">Pontus</span> (Jonathan); the successor of Nimrod (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Arioch</span>. Sanscrit, <span class="accented">Arjaka</span>, venerated (Bohlen, Gesenius, Furst); probably from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, a lion, hence leonine (Gesenius, Murphy). The name, which re. appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-14.htm">Daniel 2:14</a>, has been compared, though doubtfully, with the Urukh of the inscriptions (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 9). <span class="cmt_word">King of Ellasar</span>. <span class="accented">Pontus</span> (Symmachus, Vulgate); the region between Babylon and Elymais (Gesenius); identified with Larsa or Laranka, the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of the Greeks, now <span class="accented">Senkereh</span>, a town of Lower Babylonia, between <span class="accented">Mugheir</span> (Ur) and <span class="accented">Wrarka</span> (Erech), on the left bank of the Euphrates (Rawlinson). <span class="cmt_word">Chedorlaomer</span>. A "handful of sheaves," if the word be Phoenicio-Shemitie, though probably its true etymology should be sought in ancient Persian (Gesenius, Furst). The name has been detected by archaeologists in <span class="accented">Kudur-mapula</span>, the Ravager of the West, whom monumental evidence declares to have reigned over Babylon in the <span class="date">twentieth century B.C.</span>; and "<span class="accented">Kudurnanhundi</span> the Elamite, the worship of the great gods who did not fear," and the conqueror of Chaldaea, <span class="date">B.C. 2280</span>; but in both instances the identifications are problematical. The name Chedorlaomer in Babylonian would be <span class="accented">Kudur-lagamer</span>; but as yet this name has not been found on the inscriptions (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3 pp. 7, 19). <span class="cmt_word">King of Elam</span>. East of Babylonia, on the north of the Persian Gulf (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Tidal</span>. "Fear, veneration" (Gesenius); terror (Murphy); "splendor, renown" (Furst); though the name may not be Shemitic. <span class="cmt_word">King of nations</span>. The Scythians (Symmachus); the Galilean heathen (Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch), which are inappropriate in this connection nomadic races (Rawlinson); probably some smaller tribes so gradually subjugated by Tidal as to render it "impossible to describe him briefly with any degree of accuracy" (Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-12 The wars of nations make great figure in history, but we should not have had the record of this war if Abram and Lot had not been concerned. Out of covetousness, Lot had settled in fruitful, but wicked Sodom. Its inhabitants were the most ripe for vengeance of all the descendants of Canaan. The invaders were from Chaldea and Persia, then only small kingdoms. They took Lot among the rest, and his goods. Though he was righteous, and Abram's brother's son, yet he was with the rest in this trouble. Neither our own piety, nor our relation to the favourites of Heaven, will be our security when God's judgments are abroad. Many an honest man fares the worse for his wicked neighbours: it is our wisdom to separate, or at least to distinguish ourselves from them, 2Co 6:17. So near a relation of Abram should have been a companion and a disciple of Abram. If he chose to dwell in Sodom, he must thank himself if he share in Sodom's losses. When we go out of the way of our duty, we put ourselves from under God's protection, and cannot expect that the choice made by our lusts, should end to our comfort. They took Lot's goods; it is just with God to deprive us of enjoyments, by which we suffer ourselves to be deprived of the enjoyment of him.</body></html>
