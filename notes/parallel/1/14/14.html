The word for <span class= "ital">trained </span>comes from the same root as the name Enoch, for which see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-17.htm" title="And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.">Genesis 4:17</a>. As Abram's cattle would often be exposed to danger from the Amalekites, who throughout the Biblical history appear as a race of inveterate plunderers, there is no reason to doubt that these men were trained and practised in the use of weapons. This large number of servants born in his house, and of an age capable of undergoing the fatigues of a rapid pursuit, added to the older men left to defend and take care of the cattle, proves that Abram was the chieftain of a powerful tribe.<p><span class= "bld">Dan.</span>--There is a city of this name in Gilead, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm" title="And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>, but this is probably the better known town at the source of the Jordan, also called Laish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-29.htm" title="And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.">Judges 18:29</a>). For having swept the hill country on his march southwards, Chedorlaomer would now plunder the rich vale of the Jordan as his final exploit. Dan is about 140 miles from Hebron, where Abram began his march.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Abram heard that his brother</span> - so called as his brother's son, or simply as his relative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-8.htm">Genesis 42:8</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">was taken captive, he</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and he</span> - <span class="cmt_word">armed</span> - literally, <span class="accented">caused to pour forth, i.e.</span> drew out in a body, from a toot signifying "to pour out" (Gesenius, Furst); from a root meaning to unsheath or draw out anything as from a scabbard, and hence equivalent to <span class="accented">expedivit</span>, he got ready (Onkelos, Saadias, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary').

Murphy regards Dan as the original designation of the town, which was changed under the Sidonians to Laish (lion), and restored at the conquest. Clericus suggests that the Jordan fountain may have been styled Dan, "Judge," and the neighboring town Laish, and that the Danites, observing the coincidence of the former with the name of their own tribe, gave it to the city they had conquered. Alford is doubtful whether <span class="accented">Dan-juan was</span> really different from Laish. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:13-16 Abram takes this opportunity to give a real proof of his being truly friendly to Lot.
