When Abram went there, horses do not seem as yet to have been known (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-16.htm" title="And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.">Genesis 12:16</a>), but oxen and asses were common, and the former indigenous in the country (Maspero, <span class= "ital">Histoire Ancienne, </span>pp. 11, 12). The horse was introduced by the Hyksos, according to Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Les Prem. Civilisations, </span>i., 306 ff.; Rawlin-son, <span class= "ital">Egypt, </span>i., 74; and the first representation of one is drawing the war-chariot of the king who expelled them. The "flocks" are expressly said in the. Hebrew to be <span class= "ital">sheep. </span>This, too, is important; for while goats were indigenous in Egypt, sheep do not appear in the most ancient monuments, though they were introduced at an earlier date than horses.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:13-26 Care being taken of Jacob and his family, which mercy was especially designed by Providence in Joseph's advancement, an account is given of the saving the kingdom of Egypt from ruin. There was no bread, and the people were ready to die. See how we depend upon God's providence. All our wealth would not keep us from starving, if rain were withheld for two or three years. See how much we are at God's mercy, and let us keep ourselves always in his love. Also see how much we smart by our own want of care. If all the Egyptians had laid up corn for themselves in the seven years of plenty, they had not been in these straits; but they regarded not the warning. Silver and gold would not feed them: they must have corn. All that a man hath will he give for his life. We cannot judge this matter by modern rules. It is plain that the Egyptians regarded Joseph as a public benefactor. The whole is consistent with Joseph's character, acting between Pharaoh and his subjects, in the fear of God. The Egyptians confessed concerning Joseph, Thou hast saved our lives. What multitudes will gratefully say to Jesus, at the last day, Thou hast saved our souls from the most tremendous destruction, and in the season of uttermost distress! The Egyptians parted with all their property, and even their liberty, for the saving of their lives: can it then be too much for us to count all but loss, and part with all, at His command, and for His sake, who will both save our souls, and give us an hundredfold, even here, in this present world? Surely if saved by Christ, we shall be willing to become his servants.</body></html>
