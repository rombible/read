Undoubtedly it means something solid; and such was the idea of the Greeks, and probably also of the Hebrews. As such it appears in the poetry of the Bible, where it is described as a mighty vault of molten glass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm" title="Have you with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?">Job 37:18</a>), upheld by the mountains as pillars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-8.htm" title="Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.">2Samuel 22:8</a>), and having doors and lattices through which the Deity pours forth abundance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm" title="In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm" title="Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,">Psalm 78:23</a>). Even in this "Hymn of Creation" we have poetry, but not expressed in vivid metaphors, but in sober and thoughtful language. Here, therefore, the word rendered "firmament" means an <span class= "ital">expanse. </span>If, as geologists tell us, the earth at this stage was an incandescent mass, this expanse would be the ring of equilibrium, where the heat supplied from below was exactly equal to that given off by radiation into the cold ether above. And gradually this would sink lower and lower, until finally it reached the surface of the earth; and at this point the work of the second day would be complete.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">Day</span> <span class="accented">two</span>. The work of this day consisted in the formation of that immense gaseous ocean, called the atmosphere, by which the earth is encircled. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let there be a firmament</span> (<span class="accented">rakiya</span>, an expand, from <span class="accented">rakah</span>, to beat out; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">firmamentum</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in the</span> <span class="cmt_word">midst of the waters</span>. To affirm with Knobel, Gesenius, and others that the Hebrews supposed the atmospheric heavens to be a metallic substance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>), a vault fixed on the water-flood which surrounds the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>), firm as a molten looking-glass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm">Job 37:18</a>), borne by the highest mountains, which are therefore called the pillars and foundations of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-8.htm">2 Samuel 22:8</a>), and having doors and windows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23</a>), is to confound poetical metaphor with literal prose, optical and phenomenal language with strict scientific statement. The Vulgate and English translations of <span class="accented">rakiya</span> may convey the idea of solidity, though it is doubtful if <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.) does not signify that which <span class="accented">makes</span> firm as well as that which is made firm (McCaul, Wordsworth, W. Lewis), thus referring to the well-known scientific fact that the atmosphere by its weight upon the waters of the sea keeps them down, and by its pressure against our bodies keeps them up; but it is certain that not <span class="accented">solidity</span>, but <span class="accented">expansiveness</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> the idea represented by <span class="accented">rakiya</span> (cf. Scottish, tax, to stretch; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm">Job 37:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,<br />Transparent, elemental air, diffused<br />In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great round."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Milton, 'Par. Lost,' Bk. 7.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">And let it divide the waters from the waters</span>. What these waters were, which were designed to be parted by the atmospheric firmament, is explained in the verse which follows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-13 The earth was emptiness, but by a word spoken, it became full of God's riches, and his they are still. Though the use of them is allowed to man, they are from God, and to his service and honour they must be used. The earth, at his command, brings forth grass, herbs, and fruits. God must have the glory of all the benefit we receive from the produce of the earth. If we have, through grace, an interest in Him who is the Fountain, we may rejoice in him when the streams of temporal mercies are dried up.</body></html>
