Light was created on the first day, and on the fourth it was gathered into light-bearers; on the second day air and water were called into being, and on the fifth day they were peopled with life; lastly, on the third day the dry land appeared, and on the sixth day it became the home of animals and man.<p><span class= "bld">Bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">let the waters swarm a swarm of living soul. </span>But the word <span class= "ital">soul </span>properly signifies "breath," and thus, after the long pause of the fourth day, during which vegetation was advancing under the ripening effects of solar heat, we now hasten onward to another creative act, by which God called into being creatures which live by breathing. And as vegetation began with a green tinge upon the rocks, so doubtless animal life began in the most rudimentary manner, and advanced through animalcules and insects up to fish and reptiles. The main point noticed in the text as to the living things produced on this day is their fecundity. They are all those creatures which multiply in masses. It does not, however, follow that the highest forms of fish and reptiles were reached before the lowest form of land animal was created. All that we are taught is that the Infusoria and Ovipara preceded the Mammalia. As the most perfect trees may not have been produced till the Garden of Eden was planted, so the peacock may not have spread his gaudy plumes till the time was approaching when there would be human eyes capable of admiring his beauty.<p><span class= "bld">And fowl that may fly.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">and let fowl, </span>or winged creatures, <span class= "ital">fly above the earth. </span>It does not say that they were formed out of the water (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-19.htm" title="And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.">Genesis 2:19</a>). Nor is it confined to birds, but includes all creatures that can wing their way in the air.<p><span class= "bld">In the open firmament.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">upon the face of the expanse of heaven</span>--that is, in front of it, upon the lower surface of the atmosphere near to the earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Day five. The waters and the air, separated on the second day, are on this filled with their respective inhabitants. <span class="cmt_word">And God said.</span> Nature never makes an onward movement, in the sense of an absolutely new departure, unless under the impulse of the word of Elohim. These words distinctly claim that the creatures of the sea and of the air, even if evolved from material elements, were produced in obedience to Divine command, and not spontaneously generated by the <span class="accented">potentia vitae</span> of either land, sea, or sky. <span class="cmt_word">Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature.</span> Literally, swarm with swarmers, or crawl with crawlers. The fundamental signification of <span class="accented">sharatz</span> is to creep or swarm, and hence to multiply (Gesenius); or, <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, to multiply in masses, and hence to swarm or abound (Furst; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-17.htm">Genesis 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a>). The <span class="accented">sheretzim</span>, though including small aquatic creatures that have short or no legs, are obviously "<span class="accented">all</span> kinds of living creatures inhabiting either land or water which are oviparous and remarkable for fecundity" (Bush). We may, therefore, understand the creative fiat of the fifth day as summoning first into existence the insect creation (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20-23</a> defined as <span class="accented">flying sheretzim</span>), the fishes of the sea (<span class="accented">sheretzim</span> of the waters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-9.htm">Leviticus 11:9, 10</a>), and the reptiles and saurians of sea and land (<span class="accented">sheretzim</span> of the land, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-41.htm">Leviticus 11:41, 42</a>). Dawson concludes that "the prolific animals of the fifth day's creation belonged to the three Cuvierian sub-kingdoms of the radiata articulata, mollusca, and to the classes of fish and reptiles among the vertebrata. <span class="cmt_word">That hath life</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh chayyah</span>; literally, a living breath. Here the creatures of the sea are distinguished from all previous creations, and in particular from vegetation, as being possessed of a vital principle. This does not, of course, contradict the well-known truth that plants are living organisms. Only the life principle of the animal creation is different from that of the vegetable kingdom. It may be impossible by the most acute microscopic analysis to differentiate the protoplasmic cell of vegetable matter from that of animal organisms, and plants may appear to be possessed of functions that resemble those of animals, yet the two are generically different - vegetable protoplasm never weaving animal texture, and plant fiber never issuing from the loom of animal protoplasm. That which constitutes an animal is the possession of respiratory organs, to which, doubtless. there is a reference in the term <span class="accented">nephesh</span> from <span class="accented">naphash</span>, to breathe. <span class="cmt_word">And fowl that may fly</span>. Literally, let "winged creatures" fly. The fowls include all tribes covered with feathers that can raise themselves hate the air. The English version produces the impression that they were made from the waters, which is contrary to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>. The correct rendering disposes of the difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">Above the earth in the open firmament of heaven</span>. Not above the firmament like the clouds (Von Bohlen, Baumgarten), but in the concave vault (Tuch, Delitzsch), or before the surface of the expanse (Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-25 God commanded the fish and fowl to be produced. This command he himself executed. Insects, which are more numerous than the birds and beasts, and as curious, seem to have been part of this day's work. The Creator's wisdom and power are to be admired as much in an ant as in an elephant. The power of God's providence preserves all things, and fruitfulness is the effect of his blessing.</body></html>
