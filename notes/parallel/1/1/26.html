The making of man is so ushered in as to show that at length the work of creation had reached its perfection and ultimate goal. As regards the use of the plural here, Maimonides thinks that God took counsel with the earth, the latter supplying the body and Elohim the soul. But it is denied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-13.htm" title="Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counselor has taught him?">Isaiah 40:13</a> that God ever took counsel with any one but Himself. The Jewish interpreters generally think that the angels are meant. More truly and more reverently we may say that this first chapter of Genesis is the chapter of mysteries, and just as "the wind of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm" title="And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.">Genesis 1:2</a> was the pregnant germ which grew into the revelation of the Holy Ghost, so in Elohim, the many powers concentrated in one being, lies the germ of the doctrine of a plurality of persons in the Divine Unity. It is not a formal proof of the Trinity, nor do believers in the inspiration of Holy Scripture so use it. What they affirm is, that from the very beginning the Bible is full of such germs, and that no one of them remains barren, but all develop, and become Christian truths. There is in this first book a vast array of figures, types, indications, yearnings, hopes, fears, promises, and express predictions, which advance onwards like an ever-deepening river, and when they all find a logical fulfilment in one way, the conclusion is that that fulfilment is not only true, but was intended.<p><span class= "bld">Man.</span>--Hebrew, <span class= "ital">Adam. </span>In Assyrian the name for man is also <span class= "ital">adamu, </span>or <span class= "ital">admu. </span>In that literature, so marvellously preserved to our days, Sir H. Rawlinson thinks that he has traced the first man up to the black or Accadian race. It is hopeless to attempt any derivation of the name, as it must have existed before any of the verbs and nouns from which commentators attempt to give it a meaning; and the <span class= "ital">adamah, </span>or "tilled ground," of which we shall soon hear so much, evidently had its name from Adam.<p><span class= "bld">In our image, after our likeness.</span>--The human body is after God's image only as being the means whereby man attains to dominion: for dominion is God's attribute, inasmuch as He is sole Lord. Man's body, therefore, as that of one who rules, is erect, and endowed with speech, that he may give the word of command. The soul is first, in God's <span class= "ital">image. </span>This, as suggesting an external likeness, may refer to man's reason, free-will, self-consciousness, and so on. But it is, secondly, in God's <span class= "ital">likeness, </span>which implies something closer and more inward. It refers to man's moral powers, and especially to his capacity of attaining unto holiness. Now man has lost neither of these two. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm" title="Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.">James 3:9</a>.) Both were weakened and defiled by the fall, but were still retained in a greater or less degree. In the man Christ Jesus both were perfect; and fallen man, when new-created in Christ, attains actually to that perfection which was his only potentially at his first creation, and to which Adam never did attain.<p><span class= "bld">Let them have dominion.</span>--The plural here shows that we have to do not with Adam and Eve, but with the human race generally. This, too, agrees with the whole bearing of the first chapter, which deals in a large general way with genera and species, and not with individuals. This is important as an additional proof that God's likeness and image belong to the whole species man, and could not therefore have been lost by the fall, as St. Augustine supposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - The importance assigned in the Biblical record to the creation of man is indicated by the manner in which it is introduced. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let us make man.</span> Having already explained the significance of the term <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, as suggesting the fullness of the Divine personality, and foreshadowing the doctrine of the Trinity (ver. 1), other interpretations, such as that God takes counsel with the angels (Philo, Aben Ezra, Delitzsch), or with the earth (Maimonides, M. Gerumlius), or with himself (Kalisch), must be set aside in favor of that which detects in the peculiar phraseology an allusion to a sublime <span class="accented">concilium</span> among the persons of the Godhead (Calvin, Macdonald, Murphy). The object which this <span class="accented">concilium</span> contemplated was the construction of a new creature to be named <span class="accented">Adam</span>; descriptive of either his <span class="accented">color</span>, from <span class="accented">adam</span>, to be red, (Josephus, Gesenius, Tuch, Hupfeld); or his <span class="accented">appearance</span>, from a root in Arabic which signifies "to shine," thus making Adam "the brilliant one;" or his <span class="accented">compactness</span>, both as an individual and as a race, from another Arabic root which means "to bring or hold together" (Meier, Furst); or his <span class="accented">nature as</span> God's image, from <span class="accented">dam</span>, likeness (Eichorn, Richers); or, and most probably, his <span class="accented">origin</span>, from <span class="accented">adamah</span>, the ground (Kimchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">In our image, after our likeness</span>. The precise relationship in which the nature of the <span class="accented">Adam</span> about to be produced should stand to <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was to be that of a <span class="accented">tselem</span> (shadow - vid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) and a <span class="accented">damuth</span> (likeness, from <span class="accented">damah</span>, to bring together, to compare - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). As nearly as possible the terms are synonymous. If any distinction does exist between them, perhaps <span class="accented">tselem</span> (image) denotes the shadow outline of a figure, and <span class="accented">damuth</span> (likeness) the correspondence or resemblance of that shadow to the figure. The early Fathers were of opinion that the words were expressive of separate ideas: <span class="accented">image</span>, of the body, which by reason of its beauty, intelligent aspect, and erect stature was an adumbration of God; <span class="accented">likeness</span>, of the soul, or the intellectual and moral nature. According to Augustine <span class="accented">image</span> had reference to the <span class="accented">cognitio veritatis</span>; <span class="accented">likeness</span> to <span class="accented">amor virtutis</span>. Irenaeus, Clement, and Origen saw in the first man nature as originally created, and in the second what that nature might become through personal ethical conflict, or through the influence of grace. Bellarmine thought "imaginem in natura, similitudinem in probitate et justitia sitam esse," and conceived that "Adamum peccando non imaginem Dei, sed similitudinero perdidisse." Havernick suggests that image is the concrete, and <span class="accented">likeness</span> the abstract designation of the idea. Modern expositors generally discover no distinction whatever between the words; in this respect following Luther, who renders <span class="accented">an image that is like</span>, and Calvin, who denies that any difference exists between the two. As to what in man constituted the <span class="accented">imago Dei</span>, the reformed theologians commonly held it to have consisted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the spirituality of his being, as an intelligent and free agent; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the moral integrity and holiness of his nature; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in his dominion over the creatures (cf. West. Conf., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In this connection the profound thought of Maimonides, elaborated by Tayler <span class="accented">Lewis</span> (<span class="accented">vial</span>. <span class="accented">Lunge</span>, <span class="accented">in loco</span>), should not be overlooked, that <span class="accented">tselem is</span> the specific, as opposed to the architectural, form of a thing; that which inwardly makes a thing what it is, as opposed to that external configuration which it actually possesses. It corresponds to the <span class="accented">rain</span>, or kind, which determines species among animals. It is that which constitutes 'the genus <span class="accented">homo</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And let them have dominion</span>. The relationship of man to the rest of creation is now defined to be one of rule and supremacy. The employment of the plural is the first indication that not simply an individual was about to be called into existence, but a race, comprising many individuals The range of man's authority is farther specified, and the sphere of his lordship traced by an enumeration in ascending order, from the lowest to the highest, of the subjects placed beneath his sway. His dominion should extend <span class="cmt_word">over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air</span> (literally, the heavens), <span class="cmt_word">and over the cattle</span> (the <span class="accented">behemah</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing</span> (romeo) <span class="cmt_word">that creepeth upon the earth.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-28 Man was made last of all the creatures: this was both an honour and a favour to him. Yet man was made the same day that the beasts were; his body was made of the same earth with theirs; and while he is in the body, he inhabits the same earth with them. God forbid that by indulging the body, and the desires of it, we should make ourselves like the beasts that perish! Man was to be a creature different from all that had been hitherto made. Flesh and spirit, heaven and earth, must be put together in him. God said, Let us make man. Man, when he was made, was to glorify the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Into that great name we are baptized, for to that great name we owe our being. It is the soul of man that especially bears God's image. Man was made upright, Ec 7:29. His understanding saw Divine things clearly and truly; there were no errors or mistakes in his knowledge; his will consented at once, and in all things, to the will of God. His affections were all regular, and he had no bad appetites or passions. His thoughts were easily brought and fixed to the best subjects. Thus holy, thus happy, were our first parents in having the image of God upon them. But how is this image of God upon man defaced! May the Lord renew it upon our souls by his grace!</body></html>
