It need mean no more than that land animals, produced on the dry ground, were now to follow upon those produced in the waters. However produced, we believe that the sole active power was the creative will of God, but of His <span class= "ital">modus operandi </span>we know nothing.<p>On this sixth creative day there are four words of power. By the first, the higher animals are summoned into being; by the second, man; the third provides for the continuance and increase of the beings which God had created; the fourth assigns the vegetable world both to man and animals as food.<p>The creation of man is thus made a distinct act; for though created on the sixth day, because he is a land animal, yet it is in the latter part of the day, and after a pause of contemplation and counsel. The reason for this, we venture to affirm, is that in man's creation we have a far greater advance in the work of the Almighty than at any previous stage. For up to this time all has been <span class= "ital">law, </span>and the highest point reached was <span class= "ital">instinct; </span>we have now freedom, reason, intellect, speech. The evolutionist may give us many an interesting theory about the upgrowth of man's physical nature, but the introduction of this moral and mental freedom places as wide a chasm in his way as the first introduction of vegetable, and then of animal life.<p><span class= "bld">The living creature, </span>or rather, <span class= "ital">the creature that lives by breathing, </span>is divided into three classes. The first is <span class= "ital">"</span>behemah," <span class= "ital">cattle: </span>literally, the <span class= "ital">dumb </span>brute, but especially used of the larger ruminants, which were soon domesticated, and became man's speechless servants. Next comes the "creeping thing," or rather, <span class= "ital">moving thing, </span>from a verb translated <span class= "ital">moveth </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a>. It probably signifies the whole multitude of small animals, and not reptiles particularly. For strictly the word refers rather to their number than to their means of locomotion, and means a <span class= "ital">swarm. </span>The third class is the "beast of the earth," the wild animals that roam over a large extent of country, including the carnivora. But as a vegetable diet is expressly assigned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm" title="And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps on the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.">Genesis 1:30</a> to the "beast of the earth," while the evidence of the rocks proves that even on the fifth day the saurians fed upon fish and upon one another, the record seems to point out a closer relation between man and the graminivora than with these fierce denizens of the forest. The narrative of the flood proves conclusively that there were no carnivora in the ark; and immediately afterwards beasts that kill men were ordered to be destroyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5-6</a>). It is plain that from the first these beasts lay outside the covenant. But as early as the fourth century, Titus, Bishop of Bostra, in his treatise against the <span class= "ital">Manichees, </span>showed, on other than geological grounds, that the carnivora existed before the fall, and that there was nothing inconsistent with God's wisdom or love in their feeding upon other animals. In spite of their presence, all was good. The evidence of geology proves that in the age when the carnivora were most abundant, the graminivora were represented by species of enormous size, and that they flourished in multitudes far surpassing anything that exists in the present day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Day</span> <span class="accented">six</span>. Like day three, this is distinguished by a double creative act, the production of the higher or land animals and the creation of man, of the latter of which it is perhaps permissible to see a mute prediction in the vegetation which closed the first half of the creative week. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind</span>. In these words the land animals are generically characterized as <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>, or animated beings; in the terms which follow they are subdivided into three well-defined species or classes. <span class="cmt_word">Cattle</span>. <span class="accented">Behemah</span>; literally, the dumb animal, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the larger grass-eating quadrupeds. <span class="cmt_word">And creeping thing.</span> <span class="accented">Remes</span>; the moving animal, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the smaller animals that move either without feet or with feet that are scarcely perceptible, such as worms, insects, reptiles. Here it is land-creepers that are meant, the <span class="accented">remes</span> of the sea having been created on the previous day. <span class="cmt_word">And beast of the earth</span> (<span class="accented">chayyah</span> of the earth) <span class="cmt_word">after his kind</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wild, roving, carnivorous beasts of the forest. In these three comprehensive orders was the earth commanded to produce its occupants; which, however, no more implied that the animals were to be developed from the soil than were the finny tribes generated by the sea. Simply in obedience to the Divine call, and as the product of creative energy, they were to spring from the plastic dust as being essentially earth-born creatures. <span class="cmt_word">And it was so</span>. Modern evolutionists believe they can conceive - they have never yet been able to demonstrate - the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> of the supreme Artificer in the execution of this part of the sixth day's work. Revelation has not deemed it needful to do more than simply state that they were - not, by an evolutionary process carried on through inconceivably long periods of time, developed from the creatures of the fifth day, but - produced directly from the soil by the fiat of Elohim. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-25 God commanded the fish and fowl to be produced. This command he himself executed. Insects, which are more numerous than the birds and beasts, and as curious, seem to have been part of this day's work. The Creator's wisdom and power are to be admired as much in an ant as in an elephant. The power of God's providence preserves all things, and fruitfulness is the effect of his blessing.</body></html>
