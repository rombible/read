In the case of God blessing inanimate things, it signifies to make them to prosper and be abundant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a>).

The Divine benediction was not simply a wish; but, adds Calvin, "by the bare intimation of his purpose he effects what men seek by entreaty." Nor was it meaningless that the words of benediction were addressed to the creatures; it was designed to teach that the "force of the Divine word was not meant to be transient, but, being infused into their natures, to take root and constantly bear fruit" (Calvin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-25 God commanded the fish and fowl to be produced. This command he himself executed. Insects, which are more numerous than the birds and beasts, and as curious, seem to have been part of this day's work. The Creator's wisdom and power are to be admired as much in an ant as in an elephant. The power of God's providence preserves all things, and fruitfulness is the effect of his blessing.</body></html>
