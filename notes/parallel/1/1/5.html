Night.</span>--Before this distinction of night and day was possible there must have been outside the earth, not as yet the sun, but a bright phosphorescent mass, such as now enwraps that luminary; and, secondly, the earth must have begun to revolve upon its axis. Consequent upon this would be, not merely alternate periods of light and darkness, but also of heat and cold, from which would result important effects upon the formation of the earth's crust. Moreover, in thus giving "day" and "night" names, God ordained language, and that vocal sounds should be the symbols of things. This law already looks forward to the existence of man, the one being on earth who calls things by their names.<p><span class= "bld">And the evening and the morning.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And was an evening and was a morning day one, </span>the definite article not being used till <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-31.htm" title="And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.">Genesis 1:31</a>, when we have "day the sixth," which was also the last of the creative days.<p>The word "evening" means a <span class= "ital">mixture. </span>It is no longer the opaque darkness of a world without light, but the intermingling of light and darkness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/14-6.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:">Zechariah 14:6-7</a>). This is followed by a "morning," that is, a <span class= "ital">breaking forth </span>of light. Evening is placed first because there was a progress from a less to a greater brightness and order and beauty. The Jewish method of calculating the day from sunset to sunset was not the cause, but the result of this arrangement.<p><span class= "bld">The first day.</span>--A creative day is not a period of twenty-four hours, but an <span class= "ital">?on, </span>or period of indefinite duration, as the Bible itself teaches us. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a> the six days of this narrative are described as and summed up in one day, creation being there regarded, not in its successive stages, but as a whole. So by the common consent of commentators, the seventh day, or day of God's rest, is that age in which we are now living, and which will continue until the consummation of all things. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-7.htm" title="But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.">Zechariah 14:7</a> the whole Gospel dispensation is called "one day;" and constantly in Hebrew, as probably in all languages, <span class= "ital">day </span>is used in a very indefinite manner, as, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: You are to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>. Those, however, who adopt the very probable suggestion of Kurtz, that the revelation of the manner of creation was made in a succession of representations or pictures displayed before the mental vision of the tranced seer, have no difficulties. He saw the dark gloom of evening pierced by the bright morning light: that was day one. Again, an evening cleft by the light, and he saw an opening space expanding itself around the world: that was day two. Again darkness and light, and on the surface of the earth he saw the waters rushing down into the seas: that was day three. And so on. What else could he call these periods but days? But as St. Augustine pointed out, there was no sun then, and "it is very difficult for us to imagine what sort of days these could be" (<span class= "ital">De Civ. Dei, xi.</span> 6, 7). It must further be observed that this knowledge of the stages of creation could only have been given by revelation, and that the agreement of the Mosaic record with geology is so striking that there is no real difficulty in believing it to be inspired. The difficulties arise almost entirely from popular fallacies or the mistaken views of commentators. Geology has done noble service for religion in sweeping away the mean views of God's method of working which used formerly to prevail. We may add that among the Chaldeans a cosmic day was a period of 43,200 years, being the equivalent of the cycle of the procession of the equinoxes (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Les Origines de l'Histoire, </span>p. 233).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God called</span> (literally, called to) <span class="cmt_word">the light Day, and</span> (literally, to) <span class="cmt_word">the darkness he called Night</span>. "None but superficial thinkers," says Delitzsch, "<span class="accented">can</span> take offence at the idea of created things receiving names from God. The name of a thing is the expression of its nature. If the name be given by man, it fixes in a word the impression which it makes upon the human mind; but, when given by God, it expresses the reality, what the thing is in God's creation, and the place assigned it there by the side of other things." The things named were the light and the darkness; not the durations, but the phenomena. The names called were day, <span class="accented">yore</span>, and night, <span class="accented">layela</span>, which, again, were not time-measures, but character-descriptions. Ainsworth suggests that yore was intended to express "the tumult, stir, and business of the day," in all probability connecting it with <span class="accented">yam</span>, which depicts the foaming or the boiling of the sea; and that <span class="accented">layela</span>, in which he seems to detect the Latin <span class="accented">ululare</span>, is indicative of "<span class="accented">the</span> yelling or the howling of wild beasts at night." Gesenius derives the former from the unused root <span class="accented">yore</span>, which signifies to glow with heat, while the latter he associates with <span class="accented">lul</span>, also unused, to roll up, the idea being that the night wraps all things in obscurity. Macdonald sees in the naming of the creatures an expression of sovereignty and lordship, as when Adam named the beasts of the field. <span class="cmt_word">And the evening and the morning were the first day.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">And evening was</span> and <span class="accented">morning was</span>, <span class="accented">day one</span>. Considerable diversity of sentiment prevails with regard to the exact interpretation of these words. On the one hand, it is assumed that the first creative period is here described as an ordinary astronomical or sidereal day of twenty-four hours' duration, its constituent parts being characterized in the usual way, as an evening and a morning. In the judgment of Kalisch and others the peculiar phrase, "Evening was, and morning was," is simply equivalent to the later Hebrew compound "evening-morning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>), and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>), both of which denote a natural or civil day, though this is challenged, in the case of the Hebrew compound, by Macdonald. The language of the fourth commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>) is also appealed to as removing, it beyond the sphere of doubt that the evening and the morning referred to are-the component sections of an earthly day. As to the proper <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> of this initial day, however, the advocates of this interpretation are at variance among themselves; Delitzsch taking the terms <span class="accented">ereb</span> (literally, "the setting," from <span class="accented">arab</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to mix; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to set, to depart, like the sun) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and <span class="accented">boker</span> (literally, "<span class="accented">the</span> breaking forth," from <span class="accented">bakar</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> cleave, to open) in an active sense, and applying the former to the first fading of the light, and the latter to the breaking of the dawn after the first interval of darkness has passed, thus reckoning the creative days from daybreak to daybreak; while Murphy and Kalisch, who agree with him in regarding the days as ordinary solar days, declare they must be reckoned, <span class="accented">Hebraico</span> more, from sunset to sunset. But if the first day commenced with an evening or obscure period (Has <span class="accented">ereb</span> no connection with <span class="accented">arab</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> mix? May it not describe the condition of things when light and darkness were commingled?), that can be discovered only in the chaotic <span class="accented">darkness</span> out of which the light sprang. Hence, on the other hand, as it seems improbable that this was of no more than twelve hours' duration, and as the presumption is that the light-period would be commensurate in length, it has been argued that day one was not a sun-measured day, but a period of indefinite extent. Of course the length of day one practically determines the length of all the six. If it was a solar day, then they must be considered such. But as the present sidereal arrangements for the measurement of time were not then established, it is clearly gratuitous to proceed on the assumption that it was Hence, neither is it to be accepted without-demonstration that they were not likewise periods of prolonged duration. It is obvious they were if it was; and that it was appears to be suggested by the terms in which it is described. This conclusion, that the creation days were long periods, and not simply solar days, is confirmed by a variety of considerations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> In the creation record itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>) the term is employed with an obvious latitude of meaning; standing for <span class="accented">light as</span> opposed to darkness (ver. 5); day as distinguished from night; and for a period of <span class="accented">twenty-four hours</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the phrase "for days and years" (ver. 14); and again for the whole creation period of six days, or, as is more probable, for the second and third days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> General Scripture usage sanctions this interpretation of the word day as a period of indefinite duration; g. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-6.htm">Zechariah 14:6, 7</a>, which speaks of the time of our Lord s coming, and-indeed of the entire gospel dispensation, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">unus dies</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a day together unique, the only day of its kind (Delitzsch); and characterizes it as one of God's days, "known to the Lord," as if to distinguish it from one of man's ordinary civil days (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The works ascribed to the different days can with difficulty be compressed within the limits of a solar day. Taking the third day, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., if the events assigned to it belong <span class="accented">exclusively to the</span> region of the supernatural, nothing need prevent the belief that twenty-four hours were sufficient for their accomplishment; but if the Divine modus <span class="accented">operandi</span> during the first half of the creative week was through "existing causes" (even vastly accelerated), as geology affirms that it was during the second half, and as we know that it has been ever since its termination, then a considerably larger space of time than twice twelve hours must have been consumed in their execution. And the same conclusion forces itself upon the judgment from a consideration of the works allotted to the sixth day, in which not only were the animals produced and Adam made, but the former, being collected in Eden, were passed in review before the latter to be named, after which he was cast into a sleep by Jehovah Elohim, a rib extracted from his side and fashioned into a woman, and the woman presented to <span class="accented">him as</span> a partner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The duration of the seventh day of necessity determines the length of the other six. Without anticipating the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1-4</a> (<span class="accented">q</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.), it may be said that God's sabbatic rest is understood by the best interpreters of Scripture to have continued from creation's close until the present hour; so that consistency demands the previous six days to be considered as not of short, but of indefinite, duration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The language of the fourth commandment, when interpreted in accordance with the present theory, confirms the probability of its truth, If the six days in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> are simply natural days, then the seventh day, in which God is represented as having rested from his creative labors, must likewise be a natural or solar day; and if so, it is proper to observe what follows. It follows <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the events recorded in the first five verses of Genesis must be compressed into a single day of twenty-four hours, so that no gap will remain into which the short-day advocates may thrust the geologic ages, which is for them an imperative necessity; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the world is only 144 hours older than man, which is contrary to both science and revelation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the statement is incorrect that God finished all his work at the close of the sixth day; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that the fossiliferous remains which have been discovered in the earth's crust have either been deposited there since man's creation, or were created there at the first, both of which suppositions are untenable. But now, if, on the contrary, the language signifies that God labored in the fashioning of his cosmos through six successive periods of indefinite duration (olamim, aeons), and entered on the seventh day into a correspondingly long period of sabbatic rest, we can hold the opposite of every one of these conclusions, and find a convincing argument besides for the observance of the sabbath in the beautiful analogy which subsists between God s great week of olamim and man's little week of sun-measured days, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> Geology declares that the earth must have been brought to its present condition through a series of labors extending over indefinitely long epochs; and, notwithstanding the confident assertion of Kalisch and others that it is hopeless to harmonize science and revelation, the correspondence between the contents of these geologic ages and those of the Mosaic days is so surprising as to induce the belief that the latter were, like the former, extended periods. First, according to geology, traveling backward, comes the Cainozoic era, with the remains of animals, but not of man next is the Mezozoic era, with the remains of fish and fowl, but not of animals; and underneath that is the Palaeozoic era, with its carboniferous formations, but still with traces of aquatic life at its beginning and its end. Now, whether the vegetation of the third day is to be sought for in the carboniferous formations of the Palaeozoic age (Hugh Miller), or, as is more probable, in the age which saw the formation of the metamorphic rocks (Dawson), the order disclosed is precisely that which the Mosaic narrative affirms was observed first plants, then fish and fowl, and finally animals and man; so that if the testimony of the rocks be admissible at all upon the subject, it is unmistakably in favor of the long-period day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The opinion of neither Jewish nor Christian antiquity was entirely on the side of the natural-day theory. Josephus and Philo lent their sanction to the other view. Origen perceived the difficulty of having a firs. t, second, and third day, each with an evening and a morning, without the sun, moon, and stars, and resolved it by saying that these celestial luminaries were appointed "<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> ('Com. in Genesin,' 1:16). Augustine similarly writes, "Qui dies cujusmodi sint, ant perdifficile nobis, ant etiam impossibile est cogitare, quanto magis dicere Illorum autem priores tres sine sole peracti sunt, qui quarto die factus refertur" ('De Civitate Dei,' lib. 11:6, 7). Bode likewise remarks, "Fortassis hic diet nomen totius temporis nomen est, et omnia volumina seculorum hoc vocabulo includit." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> Heathen cosmogonies may also be appealed to as an indirect confirmation of the preceding evidence. Egyptian, Persian, Indian, and Etruscan legends represent the elaboration of the world as having been accomplished in a series of ages of prolonged duration. "God created in the first thousand years heaven and earth; in the second the vault of heaven; in the third the sea and the other waters of the earth; in the fourth the sun, moon, and stars; in the fifth the inhabitants of the air, of the water, and of the land; and in the sixth man," is the creation story of Etruria; and although in itself it has no validity, yet, as a traditional reflection of the Mosaic narrative it is not entirely destitute of weight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:3-5 God said, Let there be light; he willed it, and at once there was light. Oh, the power of the word of God! And in the new creation, the first thing that is wrought in the soul is light: the blessed Spirit works upon the will and affections by enlightening the understanding. Those who by sin were darkness, by grace become light in the Lord. Darkness would have been always upon fallen man, if the Son of God had not come and given us understanding, 1Jo 5:20. The light which God willed, he approved of. God divided the light from the darkness; for what fellowship has light with darkness? In heaven there is perfect light, and no darkness at all; in hell, utter darkness, and no gleam of light. The day and the night are the Lord's; let us use both to his honour, by working for him every day, and resting in him every night, meditating in his law both day and night.</body></html>
