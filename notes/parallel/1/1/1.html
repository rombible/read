As there never was a time when God did not exist, and as activity is an essential part of His being (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>), so, probably, there was never a time when worlds did not exist; and in the process of calling them into existence when and how He willed, we may well believe that God acted in accordance with the working of some universal law, of which He is Himself the author. It was natural with St. John, when placing the same words at the commencement of his Gospel, to carry back our minds to a more absolute conceivable "beginning," when the work of creation had not commenced, and when in the whole universe there was only God.<p><span class= "bld">God.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Elohim.</span> A word plural in form, but joined with a verb singular, except when it refers to the false gods of the heathen, in which case it takes a verb plural. Its root-meaning is <span class= "ital">strength, power;</span> and the form <span class= "ital">Elohim</span> is not to be regarded as a <span class= "ital">pluralis majestatis, but</span> as embodying the effort of early human thought in feeling after the Deity, and in arriving at the conclusion that the Deity was One. Thus, in the name <span class= "ital">Elohim</span> it included in one Person all the powers, mights, and influences by which the world was first created and is now governed and maintained. In the Vedas, in the hymns recovered for us by the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions, whether Accadian or Semitic, and in all other ancient religious poetry, we find these powers ascribed to different beings; in the Bible alone Elohim is one. Christians may also well see in this a foreshadowing of the plurality of persons in the Divine Trinity; but its primary lesson is that, however diverse may seem the working of the powers of nature, the Worker is one and His work one.<p><span class= "bld">Created.</span>--Creation, in its strict sense of producing something out of nothing, contains an idea so noble and elevated that naturally human language could only gradually rise up to it. It is quite possible, therefore, that the word <span class= "ital">bara</span>, "he created," may originally have signified to <span class= "ital">hew</span> stone <span class= "ital">or fell</span> timber; but as a matter of fact it is a rare word, and employed chiefly or entirely in connection with the activity of God. As, moreover, "the heaven and the earth" can only mean the totality of all existent things, the idea of creating them out of nothing is contained in the very form of the sentence. Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm" title="So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.">Genesis 1:27</a>, where the word may signify something less than creation <span class= "ital">ex nihilo,</span> there is nevertheless a passage from inert matter to animate life, for which science knows no force, or process, or energy capable of its accomplishment.<p><span class= "bld">The heaven and the earth</span>.--The normal phrase in the Bible for the universe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-13.htm" title="Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.">Psalm 148:13</a>; Isaiah 2). To the Hebrew this consisted of our one planet and the atmosphere surrounding it, in which he beheld the sun, moon, and stars. But it is one of the more than human qualities of the language of the Holy Scriptures that, while written by men whose knowledge was in accordance with their times, it does not contradict the increased knowledge of later times. Contemporaneous with the creation of the earth was the calling into existence, not merely perhaps of our solar system, but of that sidereal universe of which we form so small a part; but naturally in the Bible our attention is confined to that which chiefly concerns ourselves.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm" title="So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.">Genesis 3:24</a>;<p>EXCURSUS B: ON THE NAMES ELOHIM AND JEHOVAH-ELOHIM.</span><p>Throughout the first account of creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm" title="And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.">Genesis 2:3</a>) the Deity is simply called <span class= "ital">Elohim. </span>This word is strictly a plural of <span class= "ital">Eloah, </span>which is used as the name of God only in poetry, or in late books like those of Nehemiah and Daniel. It is there an Aramaism, God in Syriac being <span class= "ital">Aloho, </span>in Ohaldee <span class= "ital">Ellah, </span>and in Arabic <span class= "ital">Allahu</span>--all of which are merely dialectic varieties of the Hebrew Eloah, and are used constantly in the singular number. In poetry EJoah is sometimes employed with great emphasis, as, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm" title="For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?">Psalm 18:31</a> : "Who is Eloah except Jehovah?" But while thus the sister dialects used the singular both in poetry and prose, the Hebrews used the plural Elohim as the ordinary name of God, the difference being that to the one God was simply <span class= "ital">power, strength </span>(the root-meaning of Eloah); to the other He was the union of all powers, the Almighty. The plural thus intensified the idea of the majesty and greatness of God; but besides this, it was the germ of the doctrine of a plurality of persons in the Divine unity.<p>In the second narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm" title="So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.">Genesis 3:24</a>), which is an account of the fall of man, with only such introductory matter regarding creation as was necessary for making the history complete, the Deity is styled <span class= "ital">Jehovah-Elohim. </span>The spelling of the word Jehovah is debatable, as only the consonants ( J, h, v, h) are certain, the vowels being those of the word <span class= "ital">Adonai </span>(Lord) substituted for it by the Jews when reading it in the synagogue, the first vowel being a mere apology for a sound, and pronounced <span class= "ital">a </span>or e, according to the nature of the consonant to which it is attached. It is generally represented now by a light breathing, thus--<span class= "ital">Y'hovah, 'donai. </span>As regards the spelling, Ewald, Gesenius, and others argue for Yahveh; Frst for Yehveh, or Yeheveh; and Stier, Meyer, &c, for Yehovah. The former has the analogy of several other proper names in its favour; the second the authority of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm" title="And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.">Exodus 3:14</a>; the last, those numerous names like Yehoshaphat, where the word is written Yeho. At the end of proper names the form it takes is Yahu, whence also Yah. We ought also to notice that the first consonant is really <span class= "ital">y; </span>but two or three centuries ago <span class= "ital">j </span>seems to have had the sound which we give to <span class= "ital">y </span>now, as is still the case in German.<p>But this is not a matter of mere pronunciation; there is a difference of meaning as well. Yahveh signifies "He who brings into existence;" Yehveh "He who shall be, or shall become;" what Jehovah may signify I do not know. We must further notice that the name is undoubtedly earlier than the time of Moses. At the date of the Exodus the <span class= "ital">v</span> of the verb had been changed into <span class= "ital">y. </span>Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm" title="And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.">Exodus 3:14</a>, the name of God is <span class= "ital">Ehyeh, "</span>I shall become," not Ehveh. Had the name, therefore, come into existence in the days of Moses, it would have been Yahyeh, Yehyeh, or Yehoyah, not Yahveh, &c.<p>The next fact is that the union of these two names--Jehovah-Elohim--is very unusual. In this short narrative it occurs twenty times, in the rest of the Pentateuch only once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-30.htm" title="But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.">Exodus 9:30</a>); in the whole remainder of the Bible about nine times. Once, moreover, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm" title="Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.">Psalm 1:1</a>, there is the reversed form, Elohim-Jehovah. There must, therefore, be some reason why in this narrative this peculiar junction of the two names is so predominant.<p>The usual answer is that in this section God appears in covenant with man, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm" title="And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.">Genesis 2:3</a> He was the Creator, the God of nature and not of grace, having, indeed, a closer relation to man, as being the most perfect of His creatures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>), but a relation different only in degree and not in kind. This is true, but insufficient; nor does it explain how Jehovah became the covenant name of God, and Elohim His generic title. Whatever be the right answer, we must expect to find it in the narrative itself. The facts are so remarkable, and the connection of the name Jehovah with this section so intimate, that if Holy Scripture is to command the assent of our reason we must expect to find the explanation of such peculiarities in the section wherein they occur.<p>What, then, do we find? We find this. The first section gives us the history of man's formation, with the solemn verdict that he was very good. Nature without man was simply good; with man, creation had reached its goal. In this, the succeeding section, man ceases to be very good. He is represented in it as the object of his Maker's special care, and, above all, as one put under law. Inferior creatures work by instinct, that is, practically by compulsion, and in subjection to rules and forces which control them. Man, as a free agent, attains a higher rank. He is put under law, with the power of obeying or disobeying it. God, who is the infinitely high and self-contained, works also by law, but it comes from within, from the perfectness of His own nature, and not from without, as must be the case with an imperfect being like man, whose duty is to strive after that which is better and more perfect. Add that, even in the first section, man was described as created "in God's image, after His likeness." But as law is essential to God's nature--for without it He would be the author of confusion--so is it to man's. But as this likeness is a gift conferred upon him, and not inherent, the law must come with the gift, from outside, and not from himself; and it can come only from God. Thus, then, man was necessarily, by the terms of his creation, made subject to law, and without it there could have been no progress upward. But he broke the law, and fell. Was he, then, to remain for ever a fallen being, hiding himself away from his Maker, and with the bonds of duty and love, which erewhile bound him to his Creator, broken irremediably? No. God is love; and the purpose of this narrative is not so much to give us the history of man's fall as to show that a means of restoration had been appointed. Scarcely has the breach been made I before One steps in to fill it. The breach had been caused by a subtle foe, who had beguiled our first parents in the simplicity of their innocence; but in the very hour of their condemnation they are promised an avenger, who, after a struggle, shall crush the head of their enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>).<p>Now this name, <span class= "ital">Y-h-v-h, </span>in its simplest form Yehveh, means "He shall be," or "shall become." With the substitution of <span class= "ital">y </span>for v, according to a change which had taken place generally in the Hebrew language, this is the actual spelling which we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm" title="And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.">Exodus 3:14</a> : namely, <span class= "ital">Ehyeh 'sher ?hyeh, "</span>I shall be that I shall be." Now, in the New Testament we find that the received name for the Messiah was "the coming One" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-39.htm" title="For I say to you, You shall not see me from now on, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Matthew 23:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-9.htm" title="And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord:">Mark 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-19.htm" title="And John calling to him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?">Luke 7:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-35.htm" title="Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and truly I say to you, You shall not see me, until the time come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Luke 13:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-38.htm" title="Saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.">Luke 19:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm" title="She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.">John 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm" title="Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.">John 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-4.htm" title="Then said Paul, John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.">Acts 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm" title="For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.">Hebrews 10:37</a>); and in the Revelation of St. John the name of the Triune God is, "He who is and who was, and the coming One" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-4.htm" title="And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.">Genesis 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-8.htm" title="And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.">Genesis 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-17.htm" title="And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.">Genesis 11:17</a>). But St. Paul tells us of a notable change in the language of the early Christians. Their solemn formula was Maran-atha, "Our Lord is come" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1Corinthians 16:22</a>). The Deliverer was no longer future, no longer "He who shall become," nor "He who shall be what He shall be." It is not now an indefinite hope: no longer the sighing of the creature waiting for the manifestation of Him who shall crush the head of his enemy. The faint ray of light which dawned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a> has become the risen Sun of Righteousness; the Jehovah of the Old Testament has become the Jesus of the New, of whom the Church joyfully exclaims, "We praise Thee as God: we acknowledge Thee to be Jehovah."<p>But whence arose this name Jehovah? Distinctly from the words of Eve, so miserably disappointed in their primary application: "I have gotten a man, even Jehovah," or Yehveh (Genesis 41). She, poor fallen creature, did not know the meaning of the words she uttered, but she had believed the promise, and for her faith's sake the spirit of prophecy rested upon her, and she gave him on whom her hopes were fixed the title which was to grow and swell onward till all inspired truth gathered round it and into it; and at length Elohim, the Almighty, set to it His seal by calling Himself "I shall be that I shall be" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm" title="And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.">Exodus 3:14</a>). Eve's word is simply the third person of the verb of which <span class= "ital">Ehyeh </span>is the first, and the correct translation of her speech is, "I have gotten a man, even he that shall be," or "the future one." But when God called Himself by this appellation, the word, so indefinite in her mouth, became the personal name of Israel's covenant God.<p>Thus, then, in this title of the Deity, formed from the verb of existence in what is known as the future or indefinite tense, we have the symbol of that onward longing look for the return of the golden age, or age of paradise, which elsewhere in the Bible is described as the reign of the Branch that shall grow out of Jesse's root (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4-9</a>). The hope was at first dim, distant, indistinct, but it was the foundation of all that was to follow. Prophets and psalmists were to tend and foster that hope, and make it clear and definite. But the germ of all their teaching was contained in that mystic four-lettered word, the tetragrammaton, Y-h-v-h. The name may have been popularly called Yahveh, though of this we have no proof; the Jews certainly understood by it Yehveh--"the coming One." After all, these vowels are not of so much importance as the fact that the name has the pre-formative <span class= "ital">yod. </span>The force of this letter prefixed to the root form of a Hebrew verb is to give it a future or indefinite sense; and I can find nothing whatsoever to justify the Assertion that Jehovah--to adopt the ordinary spelling--means "the existent One," and still less to attach to it a causal force, and explain it as signifying "He who calls into being."<p>Finally, the pre-Mosaical form of the name is most instructive, as showing that the expectation of the Messiah was older than the time of the Exodus. The name is really man's answer to and acceptance of the promise made to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>; and why should not Eve, to whom the assurance was given, be the first to profess her faith in it? But in this section, in which the name occurs twenty times in the course of forty-six verses, there is a far deeper truth than Eve supposed. Jehovah (<span class= "ital">Yehveh</span>) is simply "the coming One," and Eve probably attached no very definite idea to the words she was led to use. But here He is called Jehovah-Elohim, and the double name teaches us that the coming One, the future deliverer, is God, the very Elohim who at first created man. The unity, therefore, and connection between these two narratives is of the closest kind: and the prefixing in this second section of Jehovah to Elohim, the Creator's name in the first section, was the laying of the foundation stone for the doctrine that man's promised Saviour, though the woman's seed, was an Emmanuel, God as well as man.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning</span>, <span class="accented">Bereshith</span>, is neither "from eternity," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; nor "in wisdom" (Chaldee paraphrase), as if parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>; nor "by Christ," who, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, is denominated <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>; but "at the commencement of time." Without indicating when the beginning was, the expression intimates <span class="accented">that</span> the beginning was. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> seems to imply that this was the initiation of the first day's work. The formula, "And God said," with which each day opens, rather points to ver. 3 as its proper <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span>, which the beginning absolute may have antedated by an indefinite period. God <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (either <span class="accented">the highest Being to be feared</span>, from <span class="accented">alah</span>, to fear, - Hengstenberg, Delitzsch, Keil, Oehler, etc., or, more probably, <span class="accented">the strong and mighty One</span>, from <span class="accented">aul</span>, to be strong - Gesenius, Lange, Tayler Lewis, Macdonald, Murphy, etc.) is the most frequent designation of the Supreme Being in the Old Testament, occurring upwards of 2000 times, and is exclusively employed in the present section. Its plural form is to be explained neither as a remnant of polytheism (Gesenius), nor as indicating a plurality of beings through whom the Deity reveals himself (Baumgarten, Lange), nor as a plural of majesty (Aben Ezra, Kalisch, Alford), like the royal "we" of earthly potentates, a usage which the best Hebraists affirm to have no existence in the Scriptures (Macdonald), nor as a cumulative plural, answering the same purpose as a repetition of the Divine name (Hengstenberg, Dreschler, and others); but either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a <span class="accented">pluralis intensitatis</span>, expressive of the fullness of the Divine nature, and the multiplicity of the Divine powers (Delitzsch, Murphy, Macdonald); or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> notwithstanding Calvin s dread of Sabellianism, as a <span class="accented">pluralis trinitatis</span>, intended to foreshadow the threefold personality of the Godhead (Luther, Cocceius, Peter Lombard, Murphy, Candlish, etc.); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> both. The suggestion of Tayler Lewis, that the term may be a contraction for El-Elohim, the God of all superhuman powers, is inconsistent with neither of the above interpretations That the Divine name should adjust itself without difficulty to all subsequent discoveries of the fullness of the Divine personality and nature is only what we should expect in a God-given revelation. Unless where it refers to the angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>), or to heathen deities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-32.htm">Genesis 31:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-20.htm">Jeremiah 16:20</a>), or to earthly rulers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-8.htm">Exodus 22:8, 9</a>), <span class="accented">Elohim</span> is conjoined with verbs and adjectives in the singular, an anomaly in language which has been explained as suggesting the unity of the Godhead. <span class="cmt_word">Created</span>. <span class="accented">Bara</span>, one of three terms employed in this section, and in Scripture generally, to describe the Divine activity; the other two being <span class="accented">yatzar</span>, "formed," and <span class="accented">asah</span>, "made" - both signifying to construct out of pre-existing materials (cf. for <span class="accented">yatzar</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-19.htm">Genesis 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-15.htm">Psalm 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; for <span class="accented">asah</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-16.htm">Exodus 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16</a>), and predicable equally of God and man. <span class="accented">Barn</span> is used exclusively of God. Though not necessarily involved in its significance, the idea of creation <span class="accented">ex nihilo is</span> acknowledged by the best expositors to be here intended. Its employment in vers. 21, 26, though seem ugly against, is really in favor of a distinctively creative act; in both of these instances something that did not previously exist, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> animal life and the human spirit, having been called into being. In the sense of producing what is new it frequently occurs in Scripture (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-18.htm">Isaiah 65:18</a>). Thus, according to the teaching of this venerable document, the visible universe neither existed from eternity, nor was fashioned out of pre-existing materials, nor proceeded forth as an emanation from the Absolute, but was summoned into being by an express creative fiat. The New Testament boldly claims this as a doctrine peculiar to revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>). Modern science explicitly disavows it as a discovery of reason. The continuity of force admits of neither creation nor annihilation, but demands an unseen universe, out of which the visible has been produced "by an intelligent agency residing in the unseen," and into which it must eventually return ('The Unseen Universe,' pp. 167, 170). Whether the language of the writer to the Hebrews homologates the dogma of an "unseen universe" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), out of which <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the last result of science, as expressed by the authors of the above-named work, is practically an admission of the Biblical doctrine of creation. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens and the earth</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">mundus universus</span> - Gesenius, Kalisch, etc. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-15.htm">Psalm 115:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>. The earth and the heavens always mean the terrestrial globe with its aerial firmament. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-13.htm">Psalm 148:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-9.htm">Zechariah 5:9</a>). The earth here alluded to is manifestly not the dry land (ver. 10), which was not separated from the waters till the third day, but the entire mass of which our planet is composed, including the superincumbent atmosphere, which was not uplifted from the chaotic deep until the second day. The heavens are the rest of the universe. The Hebrews were aware of other heavens than the "firmament" or gaseous expanse which over-arches the earth. "Tres regiones," says Poole, "ubi ayes, ubi nubes, ubi sidera." But, beyond these, the Shemitie mind conceived of the heaven where the angels dwell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>), and where God specially resides (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>), if, indeed, this latter was not distinguished as a more exalted region than that occupied by any creature - as "the heaven of heavens," the pre-eminently sacred abode of the Supreme (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16</a>). The fundamental idea associated with the term was that of height (<span class="accented">shamayim</span>, literally, "the heights" - Gesenius, Furst). To the Greek mind heaven meant "the boundary" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - Arist.), or, "the raised up" (from <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;</span> - to be prominent - Liddell and Scott). The Latin spoke of "the con cavity" (<span class="accented">coelum</span>, allied to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, hollow), or "the engraved" (from <span class="accented">coelo</span>, to engrave). The Saxon thought of "<span class="accented">the</span> heaved-up arch." The Hebrew imagined great spaces rising tier upon tier above the earth (which, m contradistinction, was named "the flats"), just as with regard to time he spoke of <span class="accented">olamim</span> (Gr. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). Though not anticipating modern astronomical discovery, he had yet enlarged conceptions of the dimensions of the stellar world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-37.htm">Jeremiah 31:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>); and, though unacquainted with our present geographical ideas of the earth's configuration, he was able to represent it as a globe, and as suspended upon nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>). The connection of the present verse with those which follow has been much debated. The proposal of Aben Ezra, adopted by Calvin, to read, "In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was" is grammatically inadmissible. Equally objectionable on the ground of grammar is the suggestion of Bunsen and Ewald, to connect the first verse with the third, and make the second parenthetical; while it is opposed to that simplicity of construction which pervades the chapter. The device of Drs. Buckland and Chalmers, so favorably regarded by some harmonists of Scripture and geology, to read the first verse as a heading to the whole section, is exploded by the fact that no historical narration can begin with "and." To this <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1</a>. It is no exception, the second book of Moses being in reality a continuation of the first. Honest exegesis requires that ver. I shall be viewed as descriptive of the first of the series of Divine acts detailed in the chapter, and that ver. 2, while admitting of an interval, shall be held as coming in immediate succession - an interpretation, it may be said, which is fatal to the theory which discovers the geologic ages between the creative beginning and primeval chaos. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1,2 The first verse of the Bible gives us a satisfying and useful account of the origin of the earth and the heavens. The faith of humble Christians understands this better than the fancy of the most learned men. From what we see of heaven and earth, we learn the power of the great Creator. And let our make and place as men, remind us of our duty as Christians, always to keep heaven in our eye, and the earth under our feet. The Son of God, one with the Father, was with him when he made the world; nay, we are often told that the world was made by him, and nothing was made without him. Oh, what high thoughts should there be in our minds, of that great God whom we worship, and of that great Mediator in whose name we pray! And here, at the beginning of the sacred volume, we read of that Divine Spirit, whose work upon the heart of man is so often mentioned in other parts of the Bible. Observe, that at first there was nothing desirable to be seen, for the world was without form, and void; it was confusion, and emptiness. In like manner the work of grace in the soul is a new creation: and in a graceless soul, one that is not born again, there is disorder, confusion, and every evil work: it is empty of all good, for it is without God; it is dark, it is darkness itself: this is our condition by nature, till Almighty grace works a change in us.</body></html>
