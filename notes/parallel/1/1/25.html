The latter may be the order of time, the former the order of rank; or there may have been two divisions of the work, in the former of which the <span class="accented">herbivora</span> took the lead, and in the latter the <span class="accented">carnivora</span>. According to the witness of geology, "the quadrupeds did not all come forth together. Large and powerful <span class="accented">herbivore</span> first take the field, with only a few <span class="accented">carnivora</span>. These pass away. Other <span class="accented">herbivora</span>, with a larger proportion of <span class="accented">carnivora</span>, next appear. These also are exterminated, and so with others. Then the <span class="accented">carnivora</span> appear in vast numbers and power, and the <span class="accented">herbivore</span> also abound. Moreover, these races attain a magnitude and number far surpassing all that now exist. As the mammalian age draws to a close, the ancient <span class="accented">carnivora</span> and <span class="accented">herbivora</span> of that era all pass away, excepting, it is believed, a few that are useful to man. New creations of smaller size people the groves" (Dana. Quoted by Dawson, 'O.W.' p. 224). <span class="cmt_word">And God saw that it was good</span>. As in the third day's work each branch is sealed by the Divine approbation, so in this. The creation of the higher animals completed the earth's preparation for the advent of man; to which, doubtless, the Creator's commendation of his finished work had a special reference. Everything was in readiness for the <span class="accented">magnum opus</span> which was to close his creative labor and crown his completed cosmos. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:20-25 God commanded the fish and fowl to be produced. This command he himself executed. Insects, which are more numerous than the birds and beasts, and as curious, seem to have been part of this day's work. The Creator's wisdom and power are to be admired as much in an ant as in an elephant. The power of God's providence preserves all things, and fruitfulness is the effect of his blessing.</body></html>
