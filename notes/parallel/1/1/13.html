Has modern geological research any trace of this third day s vegetation? The late Hugh Miller identified the long-continued epoch of profuse vegetation, since then unparalleled in rapidity and luxuriance, which deposited the coal-measures of the carboniferous system, with the latter half of this Mosaic day. Dana, Dawson, and others, rejecting this conclusion of the eminent geologist on the ground that the underlying Devonian, Silurian, and Cambrian systems yield abundant fossiliferous remains of aquatic life, infer that the third day's vegetation is to be sought for among the "unresolved schists" of the Azoic period. The metamorphic rocks, it is true, have not as yet yielded any absolutely certain traces of vegetable life; and. indeed, it is an open question, among geologists whether any of the earliest formed metamorphic rocks now remain (cf. Green's 'Geology,' p. 308); but still it is susceptible of almost perfect demonstration that plants preceded animals upon the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Among the hypozoic strata of this early period limestone rocks and graphite have been discovered, both of these being of organic origin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> In the process of cooling the earth must have been fitted for vegetable life a long time before animals could have existed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> As the luxuriant vegetation of the coal period prepared the way for the subsequent introduction of animal life by ridding the atmosphere of carbonic acid, so by the presence of plants must the ocean have been fitted to be the abode of aquatic life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Vegetation, being directly, or mediately, the food of animals, must have had a previous existence. On these grounds Professor Dana concludes that the latter part of the Azoic age of geology corresponds with the latter half of the third creative day. In the Creation Series of Chaldean tablets are two fragments, which George Smith conjectures have a reference to the first part of the third day's work. The one is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> When the foundation of the ground of rock (thou didst make) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The foundation of the ground thou didst call... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Thou didst beautify the heaven... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> To the face of the heaven... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Thou didst give...

Though the use of them is allowed to man, they are from God, and to his service and honour they must be used. The earth, at his command, brings forth grass, herbs, and fruits. God must have the glory of all the benefit we receive from the produce of the earth. If we have, through grace, an interest in Him who is the Fountain, we may rejoice in him when the streams of temporal mercies are dried up.</body></html>
