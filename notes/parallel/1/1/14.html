The light was created on the first day, and its concentration into great centres must at once have commenced; but the great luminaries did not appear in the open sky until the fourth day. With this begins the second triad of the creative days. Up to this time there had been arrangement chiefly; heat and water had had their periods of excessive activity, but with the introduction of vegetation there came also the promise of things higher and nobler than mechanical laws. Now, this fourth day seems to mark two things: first, the surface of the earth has become so cool as to need heat given it from without and secondly, there was now a long pause in creation. No new law in it is promulgated, no new factor introduced; only the atmosphere grows clearer, the earth more dry; vegetation does its part in absorbing gases; and day by day the sun shines with more unclouded brilliancy, followed by the mild radiance of the moon, and finally, by the faint gleamings of the stars. But besides this, as the condensation of luminous matter into the sun was the last act in the shaping of our solar system, it is quite possible that during this long fourth day the sun finally assumed as nearly as possible its present dimensions and form. No doubt it is still changing and slowly drawing nearer to that period when, God's seventh day of rest being over, the knell of this our creation will sound, and the sun, with its attendant planets, and among them our earth, become what God shall then will. But during this seventh day, in which we are now living, God works only in maintaining laws already given, and no outburst either of creative or of destructive energy can take place.<p><span class= "bld">Let them be for signs</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, marks, means of knowing. This may be taken as qualifying what follows, and would then mean, Let them be means for distinguishing seasons, days, and years; but more probably it refers to the signs of the zodiac, which anciently played so important a part, not merely in astronomy, but in matters of daily life.<p><span class= "bld">Seasons.</span>--Not spring, summer, and the like, but regularly recurring periods, like the three great festivals of the Jews. In old time men depended, both in agriculture, navigation, and daily life, upon their own observation of the setting and rising of the constellations. This work is now done for us by others, and put into a convenient form in almanacks; but equally now as of old, days, years, and seasons depend upon the motion of the heavenly orbs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Day four</span>. With this day begins the second half of the creative week, whose works have a striking correspondence with the labors of the first. Having perfected the main structural arrangements of the globe by the elimination from primeval chaos of the four fundamental elements of light, air, water, and land, the formative energy of the Divine word reverts to its initial point of departure, and, in a second series of operations, carries each of these forward to completion - the light by permanently settling it in the sun, the air and water by filling therewith fowl and fish, and the land by making animals and man. The first of these engaged the Divine Artificer's attention on the fourth creative day. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let there be lights</span> (literally, places where light is, light-holders, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-16.htm">Psalm 64:16</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">luminaria</span>, Vulgate; spoken of lamps and candlesticks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-9.htm">Numbers 4:9, 16</a>) <span class="cmt_word">in the firmament</span> (literally the expanse) <span class="cmt_word">of the heaven</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> in the singular with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> in the plural is explained by Gesenius on the ground that the predicate precedes the subject (<span class="accented">vid.</span> 'Gram.,' &sect;147). The scientific accuracy of the language here used to describe the celestial luminaries relieves the Mosaic cosmogony of at least one supposed irreconcilable contradiction, that of <span class="accented">representing</span> light as having an existence independent of the sun. Equally does it dispense exegesis from the necessity of accounting for what appears a threefold creation of the heavenly bodies - in the beginning (ver. 1), on the first day (ver. 3), and again on the fourth (ver. 14). The reference in the last of these verses is not to the original creation of the matter of the supra mundane spheres (Gerlach), which was performed in the beginning, nor to the first production of light, which was the specific work of day one; but to the permanent appointment of the former to be the place, or center of radiation, for the latter. The purpose for which this arrangement was designed, so far, at least, as the earth was concerned, was threefold: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="cmt_word">To divide the day from the night</span>. Literally, between the day and the night; or, as in ver. 18, to divide the light from the darkness to continue and render permanent the separation and distinction which was effected on the first day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.</span> The celestial lights were to serve - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> For <span class="accented">signs</span>. <span class="accented">Othoth</span>, from <span class="accented">oth</span>, anything engraved, hence a mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8</a>), is employed to designate <span class="accented">a portent</span>, or sign of wanting or instruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20.htm">Isaiah 20</a>. g; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>; Acts if. 19), and here probably refers to the subsequent employment of the heavenly bodies "<span class="accented">as</span> marks or signs of important changes and occurrences in the kingdom of Providence" (Macdonald). "That they may have been designed also to subserve important purposes in the -various economy of human life, as in affording signs to the mariner and husbandman, is not improbable, though this is not so strictly the import of the original" (Bush). Still less, of course, does the word refer to mediaeval astrology or to modern meteorology. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> For seasons. <span class="accented">Moradhim</span>, set times, from <span class="accented">ya'ad</span>, to indicate, define, fix, is used of yearly returning periods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-21.htm">Genesis 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>) - the time of the migration of birds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>), the time of festivals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-19.htm">Psalm 104:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> For <span class="accented">days</span> and <span class="accented">years</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the calculation of time.

And it was so. Like every other command which Elohim issued, this was in due time followed by complete realization. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:14-19 In the fourth day's work, the creation of the sun, moon, and stars is accounted for. All these are the works of God. The stars are spoken of as they appear to our eyes, without telling their number, nature, place, size, or motions; for the Scriptures were written, not to gratify curiosity, or make us astronomers, but to lead us to God, and make us saints. The lights of heaven are made to serve him; they do it faithfully, and shine in their season without fail. We are set as lights in this world to serve God; but do we in like manner answer the end of our creation? We do not: our light does not shine before God, as his lights shine before us. We burn our Master's candles, but do not mind our Master's work.</body></html>
