So the <span class= "ital">wind of Jehovah</span> makes the grass wither (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows on it: surely the people is grass.">Isaiah 40:7</a>); and so God makes the winds His messengers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>). The argument that no wind at present existed because the atmosphere had not been created is baseless, for if water existed, so did air. But this unseen material force, wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm" title="The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.">John 3:8</a>), has ever suggested to the human mind the thought of the Divine agency, which, equally unseen, is even mightier in its working. When, then, creation is ascribed to the wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm" title="By his spirit he has garnished the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent.">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm" title="You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth.">Psalm 104:30</a>), we justly see, not the mere instrumental force employed, but rather that Divine operative energy which resides especially in the Third Person of the Holy Trinity. But we must be upon our guard against the common error of commentators, who read into the text of these most ancient documents perfect doctrines which were not revealed in their fulness until the Gospel was given. It is a marvellous fact that Genesis does contain the germ of well-nigh every evangelical truth, but it contains it in a suggestive and not a completed form. So here this mighty energising wind suggests to us the thought of the Holy Ghost, and is far more eloquent in its original simplicity than when we read into it a doctrine not made known until revelation was perfected in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Moved.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">fluttered lovingly. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm" title="As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>.) This word also would lead the mind up to the thought of the agency of a Person. In Syriac the verb is a very common one for the incubation of birds; and, in allusion to this place, it is metaphorically employed, both of the waving of the hand of the priest over the cup in consecrating the wine for the Eucharist, and of that of the patriarch over the head of a bishop at his consecration. Two points must here be noticed: the first, that the motion was not self-originated, but was external to the chaos; the second, that it was a gentle and loving energy, which tenderly and gradually, with fostering care, called forth the latent possibilities of a nascent world.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the earth</span>. Clearly the earth referred to in the preceding verse, the present terrestrial globe with its atmospheric firmament, and not simply "the land" as opposed to "the skies" (Murphy); certainly not "the heavens" of ver. 1 as well as the earth (Delitzsch); and least of all "a section of the dry land in Central Asia" (Buckland, Pye Smith). It is a sound principle of exegesis that a word shall retain the meaning it at first possesses till either intimation is made by the writer of a change in its significance, or such change is imperatively demanded by the necessities of the context, neither of which is the case here. <span class="cmt_word">Was.</span> Not "had become." <span class="cmt_word">Without form and void</span>. Literally, wasteness and emptiness, <span class="accented">tohu vabohu</span>. The words are employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a> to depict the desolation and desertion of a ruined and depopulated land, and by many have been pressed into service to support the idea of a preceding cosmos, of which the chaotic condition of our planet was the wreck (Murphy, Wordsworth, Bush, &c). Delitzsch argues, on the ground that <span class="accented">tohu vabohu</span> implies the ruin of a previous cosmos, that ver. 2 does not state specifically that God created the earth in this desolate and waste condition; and that death, which is inconceivable out of connection with sin, was in the world prior to the fall; that ver. 2 presupposes the fall of the angels, and adduces in support of his view <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-7</a> ('Bib. Psychology,' sect. 1, p. 76; Clark's 'For. Theol. Lib.') - a notion which Kalisch contemptuously classes among "the aberrations of profound minds," and "the endless reveries" of "far-sighted thinkers." Bush is confident that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>, in which Jehovah declares that he created not the earth <span class="accented">roan</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> conclusive against a primeval chaos. The parallel clause, however, shows that not the original state, but the ultimate design of the globe, was contemplated in Jehovah's language: "<span class="accented">He</span> created it not <span class="accented">tohu</span>, he formed it to be inhabited;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Creator did not intend the earth to be a desolate region, but an inhabited planet. There can scarcely be a doubt, then, that the expression portrays the condition in which the new-created earth was, not innumerable ages, but very shortly, after it was summoned into existence. It was formless and lifeless; a huge, shapeless, objectless, tenantless mass of matter, the gaseous and solid elements commingled, in which neither organized structure, nor animated form, nor even distinctly-traced outline of any kind appeared. <span class="cmt_word">And darkness</span> (was) <span class="cmt_word">upon the face of the deep.</span> The "deep," from a root signifying to disturb, is frequently applied to the sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>), and here probably intimates that the primordial matter of our globe existed in a fluid, or liquid, or molten form. Dawson distinguishes between "the deep" and the "waters," making the latter refer to the liquid condition of the globe, and the former apply to "the atmospheric waters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vaporous or aeriform mass mantling the surface of our nascent planet, and containing the materials out of which the atmosphere was afterwards elaborated ('Origin of the World,' p. 105). As yet the whole was shrouded in the thick folds of Cimmerian gloom, giving not the slightest promise of that fair world of light, order, and life into which it was about to be transformed. Only one spark of hope might have been detected in the circumstance that <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of God moved</span> (literally, brooding) <span class="cmt_word">upon the face of the waters</span>. That the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span>, or breath of God, was not "a great wind," or "a wind of God," is determined by the non-existence of the air at this particular stage in the earth's development. In accordance with Biblical usage generally, it must be regarded as a designation not simply "of the Divine power, which, like the wind and the breath, cannot be perceived" (Gesenius), but of the Holy Spirit, who is uniformly represented as the source or formative cause of all life and order in the world, whether physical, intellectual, or spiritual (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>). As it were, the mention of the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span> is the first out-blossoming of the latent fullness of the Divine personality, the initial movement in that sublime revelation of the nature of the Godhead, which, advancing slowly, and at the best but indistinctly, throughout Old Testament times, culminated in the clear and ample disclosures of the gospel The special form of this Divine agent's activity is described as that of" brooding" (<span class="accented">merachepheth</span>, from <span class="accented">raehaph</span>, <span class="accented">to be</span> tremulous, as with love; hence, in Piel, to cherish young - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>) or fluttering over the liquid elements of the shapeless and tenantless globe, communicating to them, doubtless, those formative powers of life and order which were to burst forth into operation in answer to the six words of the six ensuing days. As might have been anticipated, traces of this primeval chaos are to be detected in various heathen cosmogonies, as the following brief extracts will show: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">Chaldean</span> legend, deciphered from the creation tablet discovered in the palace of Assurbanipal, King of Assyria, 2. c. 885, depicts the desolate and void condition of the earth thus: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When above were not raised the heavens,<br />And below on the earth a plant had not grown up;<br />The abyss also had not broken up their boundaries;</span> The chaos (or water) tiamat (the sea) was the producing-mother of the whole of them," etc. ('Chaldean Genesis,' p. 62.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">The Babylonian</span> cosmogony, according to Berosus (B.C. 330-260), commences with a time "in which there existed nothing but darkness" and an abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were produced of a twofold principle... The person who presided over them was a woman named Omoroea, which in the Chaldean language is Thalatth, in Greek Thalassa, the sea, but which might equally be interpreted the moon" ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 40, 41). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The <span class="accented">Egyptian</span> account of the origin of the universe, as given by Diodorus Siculus, represents the heaven and earth as blended together, till afterwards the elements began to separate and the air to move. According to another idea, there was a vast abyss enveloped in boundless darkness, with a subtle spirit, intellectual in power, existing in the chaos (Macdonald, 'Creation and the Fall,' p. 49). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The <span class="accented">Phoenician</span> cosmogony says, "The first principle of the universe was a dark windy air and an eternal dark chaos. Through the love of the Spirit to its own principles a mixture arose, and a connection called desire, the beginning of all things. From this connection of the Spirit was begotten mot, which, according to some, signifies mud, according to others, a corruption of a watery mixture, but is probably a feminine form of <span class="accented">too</span>, water. From this were developed creatures in the shape of an egg, called zophasemin (Macdonald, p. 50). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> <span class="accented">The Indian</span> mythology is very striking in its resemblance to the Mosaic narrative." The institutes of Menu affirm' that at first all was dark, the world still resting in the purpose of the Eternal, whose first thought created water, and in it the seed of life. This became an egg, from which issued Brahma, the creative power, who divided his own substance and became male and female. The waters were called <span class="accented">nara</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being the production of Nara, or the Spirit of God, who, on account of these being his first <span class="accented">ayana</span>, or place of motion, is named Naray-na, or moving on the <span class="accented">waters</span>. A remarkable hymn from the Rig Veda, translated by Dr. Max Muller, also closely approximates to the Scriptural account: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Nor aught nor naught existed; yon bright sky<br />Was not, nor heaven's broad woof out-stretched above.<br />The only one breathed breathless by itself;<br />Other than it there nothing since hath been.<br />Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled<br />In gloom profound - an ocean without light."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Vid. Macdonald's 'Creation,' etc., p. 51.</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The description of chaos given by Ovid is too appropriate to be overlooked: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Ante mare et tellus, et, quod tegit omnia, caelum,<br />Unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe,<br />Quem dixere chaos; rudis indigestaque moles quia corpere in uno<br />Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis,<br />Mollia cum duris, sine Pendere habentia pondus"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Metamor.,' lib, 1:1</span>). Yet not more remarkable are these indirect confirmations of the truthfulness of the Biblical cosmogony than the direct corroborations it derives from the discoveries of modern science. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The <span class="accented">nebular hypothesis</span> of Laplace, which, though only a hypothesis, must vet be admitted to possess a high degree of probability, strikingly attests its authenticity. That eminent astronomer demonstrated that a huge chaotic mass of nebulous matter, revolving in space on its own axis with a sufficient velocity, and gradually condensing from a high degree of heat, would eventually, by throwing off successive rings from the parent body, develop all the celestial orbs that presently compose our planetary system. Though for a long time regarded with suspicion by Biblical scholars, and at the first only tentatively thrown out by its author, Kant, yet so exactly does it account for the phenomena of our solar system as disclosed by the telescope, that it may now be said to have vindicated its claim to be accepted as the best solution science has to give of the formation of the universe; while further and more dispassionate reflection has convinced theologians generally, that so far from conflicting with the utterances of inspiration, it rather surprisingly endorses them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The researches of <span class="accented">physical philosophy in</span> connection with hydrodynamics have successfully established that the present form of our earth, that of (the solid of revolution called) an oblate spheroid, is such as it must necessarily have assumed had its original condition been that of a liquid mass revolving round its own axis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Geological science</span> likewise contributes its quota to the constantly accumulating weight of evidence in support of the Mosaic narrative, by announcing, as the result of its investigations in connection with the earth's crust, that below a certain point, called "the stratum of invariable temperature," the heat of the interior mass becomes greater in proportion to the depth beneath the surface, thus leading not unnaturally to the inference that "the earth has assumed its present state by cooling down from an intensely heated, or gaseous, or fluid state" (Green's 'Geology,' p. 487.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1,2 The first verse of the Bible gives us a satisfying and useful account of the origin of the earth and the heavens. The faith of humble Christians understands this better than the fancy of the most learned men. From what we see of heaven and earth, we learn the power of the great Creator. And let our make and place as men, remind us of our duty as Christians, always to keep heaven in our eye, and the earth under our feet. The Son of God, one with the Father, was with him when he made the world; nay, we are often told that the world was made by him, and nothing was made without him. Oh, what high thoughts should there be in our minds, of that great God whom we worship, and of that great Mediator in whose name we pray! And here, at the beginning of the sacred volume, we read of that Divine Spirit, whose work upon the heart of man is so often mentioned in other parts of the Bible. Observe, that at first there was nothing desirable to be seen, for the world was without form, and void; it was confusion, and emptiness. In like manner the work of grace in the soul is a new creation: and in a graceless soul, one that is not born again, there is disorder, confusion, and every evil work: it is empty of all good, for it is without God; it is dark, it is darkness itself: this is our condition by nature, till Almighty grace works a change in us.</body></html>
