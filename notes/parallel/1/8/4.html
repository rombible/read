The seventh civil month would be Abib; and the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary </span>notices the following remarkable coincidences:--"On the 17th day of Abib the ark rested on Mount Ararat; on the 17th day of Abib the Israelites passed over the Red Sea; on the 17th day of Abib, Christ, our Lord, rose again from the dead."<p><span class= "bld">Ararat.</span>--If in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelled there.">Genesis 11:2</a> the Authorised Version is right in saying that the descendants of Noah travelled "from the east" to Shinar, this could not be the Ararat of Armenia. Moreover, we are told that the word in, Assyrian means "highland," and thus may signify any hilly country. In the <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis </span>the ark rests upon Nizir, a region to the east of Assyria, the highest peak of which, now named Elwend, is called in the cuneiform texts "the mountain of the world" ( <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis, </span>p. 307). The rendering, however, "from the east," is by no means certain, and many translate "eastward," and even the Authorised Version renders the word <span class= "ital">east, </span>that is, eastward, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm" title="Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.">Genesis 13:11</a>.

There are in this region two mountains of great altitude, the Aghri-Dagh and the Kara-Dagh, the highest of which is 17,260 feet above the sea-level; and naturally legend chooses this as the place where the ark settled. But the inspired narrative says that it rested "upon the mountains of Ararat," upon some chain of hills there, and seventy-three days afterwards Noah found himself surrounded by an amphitheatre of mountains, the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-5.htm" title="And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.">Genesis 8:5</a> being emphatic, and signifying "the tops of the mountains became distinctly visible," and not that they had just begun to emerge. For, doubtless, after so vast a flood, mists and vapours would for a long time prevail, and shut out the surrounding world from Noah's view.<p>The Targum of Onkelos and the Syriac translate "on the mountains of Carduchia." This range, which separates Armenia from Kurdistan, is regarded by many authorities as the hills really meant, because, as they are nearer the place whence the ark started, the difficulty regarding the course taken by it is not so insuperable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the ark rested.</span> Not stopped sailing or floating, got becalmed, and remained suspended over (Kitto's 'Cyclop.,' art.

Supposing the Flood to have begun in Marchesvan, the second month of the civil year (about the beginning of November), "we have then the remarkable coincidences that on the 17th day of Abib (about the beginning of April) the ark rested on Mount Ararat, the Israelites passed over the Red Sea, and our Lord rose again from the dead" ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">Upon the mountains</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> one of the mountains.

Ararat). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The locality which appears to have the countenance of Scripture is the region of Armenia (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>; Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, Vulgate). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> In Armenia three different mountains have been selected as the site on which the ark grounded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The modern Ararat, which rises in Northern Armenia, about twelve miles south of Erivan, in the form of two majestic cones, the one 16, 254, and the ether 12,284 feet (Parisian) in height above the level of the sea (Hierony. mus, Furst, Kalisch, Keil, Delitzsch, and Lange). All but universal tradition has decided that the loftiest of these two peaks (called Macis in Armenian; Aghri-Dagh, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the difficult or steep mountain, by the Turks; Kuchi Nuch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mountain of Noah, by the Persians) was the spot where the sacred vessel first felt the solid land. Travelers describe the appearance of this amazing elevation as of incomparable and overpowering splendor. "It appeared as if the highest mountains in the world had been piled upon each other to form this one sublime immensity of earth and rocks and snow. The icy peaks of its double head rose majestically into the clear and cloudless heavens; the sun blazed bright upon them, and the reflection sent forth a radiance equal to other suns" (Ker Porters 'Travels, 1:132; 2:636). "Nothing can be more beautiful than its shape, more awful than its height. All the surrounding mountains sink into insignificance when compared to it. It is perfect in all its parts; no hard, rugged feature, no unnatural prominences; everything is in harmony, and all combines to render it one of the sublimest objects in nature" (Morier's 'Journey,' 1:16; 2:312, 345). The ascent of the Kara Dagh, or Greater Ararat, which the Armenians believe to be guarded by angels from the profane foot of man, after two unsuccessful attempts, was accomplished in 1829 by Professor Parrot, a German, and five years later, in 1834, by the Russian traveler Automonoff. In 1856 five English travelers, Majors Stewart and Frazer, Roy. Walter Thursby, Messrs. Thee-bald and Evans, performed the herculean task. The latest successful attempt was that of Prof. Bryce of Oxford in 1876 (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Transcaucasia and Ararat:' London: Macmillan and Co., 1877). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> An unknown mountain in Central Armenia between the Araxes and lakes Van and Urumiah (Vulgate, <span class="accented">super mantes Armeniae</span>; Gesenius, Murphy, Wordsworth, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A peak in the Gordyaean mountains, or Carduchian range, separating Armenia on the south from Kurdistan (Chaldea Paraphrase, Onkelos, Syriac, Calvin), near which is a town called Naxuana, the city of Noah (Ptolemy), Idshenan (Moses Chorenensis), and Nachid-shenan, the first place of descent (the Armenians), which Josephus translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or the place of descent. Against the first is the inaccessible height of the mountain; in favor of the third is the proximity of the region to the starting-place of the ark. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-12 The ark rested upon a mountain, whither it was directed by the wise and gracious providence of God, that might rest the sooner. God has times and places of rest for his people after their tossing; and many times he provides for their seasonable and comfortable settlement, without their own contrivance, and quite beyond their own foresight. God had told Noah when the flood would come, yet he did not give him an account by revelation, at what times and by what steps it should go away. The knowledge of the former was necessary to his preparing the ark; but the knowledge of the latter would serve only to gratify curiosity; and concealing it from him would exercise his faith and patience. Noah sent forth a raven from the ark, which went flying about, and feeding on the carcasses that floated. Noah then sent forth a dove, which returned the first time without good news; but the second time, she brought an olive leaf in her bill, plucked off, plainly showing that trees, fruit trees, began to appear above water. Noah sent forth the dove the second time, seven days after the first, and the third time was after seven days also; probably on the sabbath day. Having kept the sabbath with his little church, he expected especial blessings from Heaven, and inquired concerning them. The dove is an emblem of a gracious soul, that, finding no solid peace of satisfaction in this deluged, defiling world, returns to Christ as to its ark, as to its Noah, its rest. The defiling world, returns to Christ as to its ark, as to its Noah, its rest. The carnal heart, like the raven, takes up with the world, and feeds on the carrion it finds there; but return thou to my rest, O my soul; to thy Noah, so the word is, Ps 116:7. And as Noah put forth his hand, and took the dove, and pulled her to him, into the ark, so Christ will save, and help, and welcome those that flee to him for rest.</body></html>
