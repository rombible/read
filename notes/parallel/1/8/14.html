But as a matter of fact, twelve lunar months do not make 360 days, but only about 354. Probably, therefore, the day of the new moon was often twice counted, as the last of the old month and the first of the new. But if to these 354 days we add 11, that is, from the 17th to the 27th of the second month. the result is exactly a full solar year of 365 days.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> The three Hebrew verbs employed to depict the gradual cessation of the floods express a regular gradation; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (ver. 11), to be lightened, signifying their abatement or diminution (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, LXX.); <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (ver. 13), to be dried up, indicating the disappearance of the water (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, LXX.); <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (ver. 14), to be dry, denoting the desiccation of the ground (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span>, (LXX.).

It has been conjectured that the year consisted of twelve months of thirty days, with five intercalated days at the end to make up the solar year of three hundred and sixty-five days (Ewald); of seven months of thirty days and five of thirty-one (Bohlen); of five of thirty and seven of twenty-nine (Knobel); but the circumstance that the period from the commencement of the Deluge to the touching of Ararat extended over five months exactly, and that the waters are said to have previously prevailed for one hundred and fifty days, naturally leads to the conclusion that the months of Noah's year were equal periods of thirty days. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:13-19 God consults our benefit, rather than our desires; he knows what is good for us better than we do for ourselves, and how long it is fit our restraints should continue, and desired mercies should be delayed. We would go out of the ark before the ground is dried; and perhaps, if the door, is shut, are ready to thrust off the covering, and to climb up some other way; but God's time of showing mercy is the best time. As Noah had a command to go into the ark, so, how tedious soever his confinement there was, he would wait for a command to go out of it again. We must in all our ways acknowledge God, and set him before us in all our removals. Those only go under God's protection, who follow God's direction, and submit to him.</body></html>
