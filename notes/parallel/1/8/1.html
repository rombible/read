This wind would affect the course of the ark, but scarcely so strongly as the currents of the water.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God</span>. <span class="accented">Elohim, i.e. God in</span> his most universal relation to his creatures. The supposition of two different accounts or histories being intermingled in the narrative of the Flood (Bleek, Eichhorn, Hupfeld, Kalisch, Alford, Coleuso) is not required for a sufficient explanation of the varying use of the Divine names. <span class="cmt_word">Remembered.</span> From a root signifying to prick, pierce, or print, e.g., upon the memory; hence to remember. "Not that there is oblivion or forgetfulness with God, but then God is said to remember when he showeth by the effects that he hath taken care of man" (Willet). He remembers man's sins when he punishes them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm">1 Kings 17:20</a>), and his people's needs when he supplies them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>). The expression is an anthropopathism designed to indicate the Divine compassion as well as grace. Calvin thinks the remembrance of which Moses <span class="accented">speaks</span> "ought to be referred not only to the external aspect of things (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the coming deliverance), but also to the inward feeling of the holy man," who, through grace, was privileged to enjoy "some sensible experience of the Divine presence" while immured in the ark. <span class="cmt_word">Noah</span>, - cf. the Divine remembrance of Abraham and Lot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-29.htm">Genesis 19:29</a>), the request of the Hebrew psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-1.htm">Psalm 132:1</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and every living thing</span>, - chayyah, or wild beast (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-14.htm">Genesis 7:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and all the cattle that was with him in the ark.</span> A touching indication of the tenderness of God towards his creatures (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>; 145:9, 15, 16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>). As a proof that God remembered the lonely inmates of the ark, he at once takes steps to accomplish their deliverance, which steps are next enumerated. <span class="cmt_word">And God made a wind</span> <span class="accented"> - ruach</span>. Not the Holy Ghost, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> (Theodoret, Ambrose, LXX. - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), nor the heat of the sun (Rupertus); but a current of air (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), which "would promote evaporation and aid the retreat of the waters" (Murphy): - the ordinary method of driving away rain and drying the ground (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>); the special instrumentality employed to divide the waters of the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged,</span> or <span class="accented">began to grow calm</span>, after a period of commotion (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-1.htm">Esther 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>) - the first stage in the returning of the waters. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, and the water grew tried (LXX.). <span class="accented">Cf</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-32.htm">Matthew 14:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-51.htm">Mark 6:51</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-3 The whole race of mankind, except Noah and his family, were now dead, so that God's remembering Noah, was the return of his mercy to mankind, of whom he would not make a full end. The demands of Divine justice had been answered by the ruin of sinners. God sent his wind to dry the earth, and seal up his waters. The same hand that brings the desolation, must bring the deliverance; to that hand, therefore, we must ever look. When afflictions have done the work for which they are sent, whether killing work or curing work, they will be taken away. As the earth was not drowned in a day, so it was not dried in a day. God usually works deliverance for his people gradually, that the day of small things may not be despised, nor the day of great things despaired of.</body></html>
