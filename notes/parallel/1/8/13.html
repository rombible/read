The intervals of seven days between the sending forth of the birds prove that the division of time into weeks was fully established, and also suggests that religious observances were connected with it.<p><span class= "bld">The covering of the ark.</span>--The word is elsewhere used of the covering of skins for the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm" title="And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.">Exodus 26:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-25.htm" title="And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above on it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:25</a>), and it has probably a similar meaning here. To have removed the solid framework of the roof would have been a very laborious task, and still more so to have broken up the roof itself. But as the asphalte employed for filling up the interstices between the beams in the hulk of the ark would have been difficult to manage for the roof, it was apparently protected from the rain by a covering, probably of skins sewn together.<p>No one can read the narrative without noticing that Noah is not only described as shut up within the ark, but as having very slight means of observing what was going on around. Had there been a deck, Noah would have known exactly the state of the flood, whereas, peeping only through the <span class= "ital">zohar, </span>he seems to have been able to see but little, possibly because his sight was obstructed by the overhanging eaves of the roof. Thus the freshly-plucked olive-leaf was like a revelation to him. But when these skins were taken off, there were numerous apertures through which he could obtain an uninterrupted view, and he "looked, and, behold, the face of the <span class= "ital">adamah </span>was dry."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> (literally, it was) <span class="cmt_word">in the six hundredth and first year</span> (of Noah's life; so LXX.), <span class="cmt_word">in the first month</span>, <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, (LXX.); the word for month (expressed in vers. 4, 14) being omitted in the Hebrew text for brevity, - <span class="cmt_word">the first day of the month, the waters were dried up</span> - the root signifies to burn up or become dry in consequence of heat (Furst); "it merely denotes the absence of water" (Gesenius) - <span class="cmt_word">from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark</span> <span class="accented">- mikseh</span>, from <span class="accented">kasah</span>, to cover; used of the covering of the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a>) and of the holy vessels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-8.htm">Numbers 4:8, 12</a>), and hence supposed to be made of skins (Knobel, Bush); but "the deck of an ark on which the rain-storms spent their force must surely have been of as great stability as the ark itself (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:13-19 God consults our benefit, rather than our desires; he knows what is good for us better than we do for ourselves, and how long it is fit our restraints should continue, and desired mercies should be delayed. We would go out of the ark before the ground is dried; and perhaps, if the door, is shut, are ready to thrust off the covering, and to climb up some other way; but God's time of showing mercy is the best time. As Noah had a command to go into the ark, so, how tedious soever his confinement there was, he would wait for a command to go out of it again. We must in all our ways acknowledge God, and set him before us in all our removals. Those only go under God's protection, who follow God's direction, and submit to him.</body></html>
