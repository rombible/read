Really it forms an integral portion of the numerous traditions of the flood. Thus in the <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis, </span>after the sending forth of a dove, a swallow, and a raven, we read (p. 280):--<p>"I sent them forth to the four winds; I sacrificed a sacrifice;<p>I built an altar on the peak of the mountain."<p>This extreme antiquity of sections ascribed to the Jehovist, and supposed to be an after-thought, is seriously detrimental to the whole theory.<p>One result of the flood was to sweep away all traces of the earthly paradise and of the subsequent abode of Adam; and it is probable also that Noah was removed far away from his previous home by the floating of the ark. Thus to him and his family it was a new earth, with no holy places, no spots hallowed by the past history of man. He therefore determines to consecrate the earth to Jehovah, who had been the object of the worship of his family since the days of Enos, and therefore builds an altar, the first mentioned in the Bible. By so doing he provided for future generations a central spot and sanctuary, round which their religious ideas would group themselves. The animals offered were probably the seventh of all clean kinds (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-2.htm" title="Of every clean beast you shall take to you by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.">Genesis 7:2</a>). With Noah's burnt offerings we must not connect any of the later Levitical ideas. Apparently it was a simple thank-offering, the dominant thought of which was the hallowing man's future life by commencing it with worship. It thus contained within it the presage that a better state of things had now begun. Subsequently the thank-offering became a feast, at which the offerer and his family partook of the victim as Jehovah's guests; and as God during this sacrifice gave Noah permission to eat flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-3.htm" title="Every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.">Genesis 9:3</a>), it is probable that such was the case now, and that the eating of flesh was inaugurated in this solemn way. We have, however, previously seen reason to believe that the flesh of animals had occasionally been eaten before, though not as an ordinary article of diet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Noah builded an altar</span>. <span class="accented">Mizbeach</span>, a place for slaying sacrifices, from <span class="accented">zabach</span>, to slaughter animals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>), to slay in sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-4.htm">Leviticus 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-4.htm">1 Samuel 1:4</a>), <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, is the first altar mentioned in history. The English term (from <span class="accented">altus</span>, high) signifies a high place, because the altar was commonly a raised structure or mound of earth or stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). Keil thinks that altars were not required prior to the Flood, the Divine presence being still visibly among men at the gate of Eden, "so that they could turn their offerings and their hearts towards that abode."

He begins well, that begins with God. Though Noah's stock of cattle was small, and that saved at great care and pains, yet he did not grudge to serve God out of it. Serving God with our little is the way to make it more; we must never think that is wasted with which God is honoured. The first thing done in the new world was an act of worship. We are now to express our thankfulness, not by burnt-offerings, but by praise, and pious devotions and conversation. God was well pleased with what was done. But the burning flesh could no more please God, than the blood of bulls and goats, except as typical of the sacrifice of Christ, and expressing Noah's humble faith and devotedness to God. The flood washed away the race of wicked men, but it did not remove sin from man's nature, who being conceived and born in sin, thinks, devises, and loves wickedness, even from his youth, and that as much since the flood as before. But God graciously declared he never would drown the world again. While the earth remains, and man upon it, there shall be summer and winter. It is plain that this earth is not to remain always. It, and all the works in it, must shortly be burned up; and we look for new heavens and a new earth, when all these things shall be dissolved. But as long as it does remain, God's providence will cause the course of times and seasons to go on, and makes each to know its place. And on this word we depend, that thus it shall be. We see God's promises to the creatures made good, and may infer that his promises to all believers shall be so.</body></html>
