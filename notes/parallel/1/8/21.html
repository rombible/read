There seems at first sight to be an inconsistency between the two passages, and the Jehovist is accused of here contradicting the Elohist. For in the former place man's inborn sinfulness is described as an aggravation of his offence, while here it is used as a reason for mercy. But it is a characteristic of the Bible that it states the two sides of every principle with abrupt simplicity, and most heresies have arisen from seizing upon one side only, and omitting the other from view. Man is one whose every imagination of the heart is only evil continually. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>.) In the antediluvian world, with death indefinitely postponed, these imaginations had been unrestrained, and had therefore led to habitual and inveterate sin; and so justice at last had smitten it. But when man strives against them, and sin is the result of infirmity. then mercy heals and grace strengthens the penitent. When man, therefore, began his renewed life by hallowing it with religion, God saw therein the pledge of a struggle on his part after holiness, and the proof that the world would never again become totally corrupt. In this changed state of things human weakness was a reason only for mercy, and God gave the promise that so long as the world shall last, so total a destruction of man and his works upon it shall never again take place by the same agency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">smelled</span> - as is done by drawing the air in and out through the nostrils; from the root <span class="accented">ruach, to</span> breathe; high., to smell - <span class="cmt_word">a sweet savor</span>. <span class="accented">Reach hannichoach</span> literally, an odor of satisfaction, acquiescence, or rest; from <span class="accented">nuach</span>, to rest, with an allusion to Noah's name (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-12.htm">Leviticus 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>). The meaning is that the sacrifice of the patriarch was as acceptable to God as refreshing odors are to the senses of a man; and that which rendered it acceptable was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the feeling from which it sprang, whether gratitude or obedience; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the truths which it expressed - it was tantamount to an acknowledgment of personal guilt, a devout recognition of the Divine mercy, an explicit declaration that he had been saved or could only be saved through the offering up of the life of another, and a cheerful consecration of his redeemed life to God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the great sacrifice of which it was a type. Paul, by using the language of the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), shows that he regarded the two as connected. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said in his heart</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> resolved within himself. It is not certain that this determination on the part of Jehovah was at this time communicated to the patriarch (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3, 7</a> for Divine inward resolves which were not at the moment made known), unless the correct reading be <span class="accented">to his</span> (<span class="accented">Noah's</span>) <span class="accented">heart</span>, meaning the Lord <span class="accented">comforted</span> him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-3.htm">Judges 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>), which is barely probable. <span class="cmt_word">I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">I will not add to curse</span>. Not a revocation of the curse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, nor a pledge that such curse would not be duplicated. The language refers solely to the visitation of the Deluge, and promises not that God may not some. times visit particular localities with a flood, but that another such world-wide catastrophe should never overtake the human race. <span class="cmt_word">For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a> assigns this as the reason for man's destruction; a proof of inconsistency between the Elohistic author and his Jehovistic editor (Bleek). "Hie inconstantiae videtur Deus accusari posse" (Luther). "God seems to contradict himself by having previously declared that the world must be destroyed because its iniquity was desperate" (Calvin). Some endeavor to remove the incongruity by translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as <span class="accented">although</span> (Bush, Inglis), but "there are few (if any) places were <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> can be rendered <span class="accented">although"</span> (T. Lewis). Others connect it with "<span class="accented">for</span> man's sake," as explanatory not of the promise, but of the past judgment (Murphy), or as stating that any future cursing of the ground would not be for man's sake (Jacobus). The true solution of the difficulty appears to lie in the clause "from his youth," as if God meant to say that whereas formerly he had visited man with judicial extermination on account of his absolute moral corruption, he would now have regard to the circumstance that man inherited his depravity through his birth, and, instead of smiting man with punitive destruction, would visit him with compassionate forbearance (Keil, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Tayler Lewis regards the expression as strongly anthropopathic, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>, and indicative of the Divine regret at so calamitous an act as the Deluge, although that act was absolutely just and necessary. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I again smite any more every living thing, as I have done.</span> There should be no more deluge, but - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:20-22 Noah was now gone out into a desolate world, where, one might have thought, his first care would have been to build a house for himself, but he begins with an alter for God. He begins well, that begins with God. Though Noah's stock of cattle was small, and that saved at great care and pains, yet he did not grudge to serve God out of it. Serving God with our little is the way to make it more; we must never think that is wasted with which God is honoured. The first thing done in the new world was an act of worship. We are now to express our thankfulness, not by burnt-offerings, but by praise, and pious devotions and conversation. God was well pleased with what was done. But the burning flesh could no more please God, than the blood of bulls and goats, except as typical of the sacrifice of Christ, and expressing Noah's humble faith and devotedness to God. The flood washed away the race of wicked men, but it did not remove sin from man's nature, who being conceived and born in sin, thinks, devises, and loves wickedness, even from his youth, and that as much since the flood as before. But God graciously declared he never would drown the world again. While the earth remains, and man upon it, there shall be summer and winter. It is plain that this earth is not to remain always. It, and all the works in it, must shortly be burned up; and we look for new heavens and a new earth, when all these things shall be dissolved. But as long as it does remain, God's providence will cause the course of times and seasons to go on, and makes each to know its place. And on this word we depend, that thus it shall be. We see God's promises to the creatures made good, and may infer that his promises to all believers shall be so.</body></html>
