He had waited forty days after seeing the heights around him rising clearly into the air, and then, impatient of the slow subsidence of the waters, Noah at last sent forth a raven to bring him some news of the state of the earth. This bird was chosen as one strong of flight, and also, perhaps, because anciently regarded as prophetic of the weather; besides this, it is easily tamed, and as Noah retained its mate he had security for its return. And so it seems to have done, for it is described as going "forth to and fro." Each night it returned to the ark, and probably to its old perch near the female. The <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis </span>agrees with many commentators and the ancient versions in supposing that the raven did not return, finding abundant food in the floating dead bodies (<span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis, </span>p. 286); but this is contrary to the Hebrew. The versions must have had a negative in their copies, and have read, "which went forth, going, and not returning." The present Hebrew text is, however, consistent with itself; for it adds, "until the waters," &c. This must mean that as soon as the earth was dry this going to and fro ceased.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span>, literally, <span class="accented">it</span> was - <span class="cmt_word">at the end of forty days.</span> Delaying through combined fear and sorrow on account of the Divine judgment (Calvin); to allow sufficient space to undo the effect of the forty days' rain (Murphy); probably just to be assured that the Deluge would not return. <span class="cmt_word">That Noah opened the window</span> - <span class="accented">chalon</span>, a window, "so called from being perforated, from <span class="accented">chalal</span>, to bore or pierce" (Gesenius); used of the window of Rahab's house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18</a>); not the window (<span class="accented">tsohar</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-16.htm">Genesis 6:16</a>, q.v. - <span class="cmt_word">of the ark which ha had made</span>: <span class="cmt_word">and he sent forth a raven.</span> Literally, the <span class="accented">orev</span>, so called from its black color' (Gesenius; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-11.htm">Song of Solomon 5:11</a>), Latin, <span class="accented">corvus</span>, a raven or crow; the article being used either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the species of bird is intended to be indicated (Kalisch), or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because there was only one male raven in the ark, the raven being among the unclean birds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:14</a>; Lunge); but against this is "the dove" (per. 8); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because it had come to be well known from this particular circumstance (Keil). Its peculiar fitness for the mission imposed on it lay in its being a bird of prey, and therefore able to sustain itself by feeding on carrion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>). To the incident here recorded is doubtless to be traced the prophetic character which in the ancient heathen world, and among the Arabians in particular, was supposed to attach to this ominous bird. <span class="cmt_word">Which went to and fro.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">and it went forth going and returning, i.e.</span> flying backwards and forwards, from the ark and to the ark, perhaps resting on it, but not entering into it (Calvin, Willet, Ainsworth, Keil, Kalisch, Lunge, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary'); though some have conceived that it no more returned to the ark, but kept flying to and fro throughout the earth (LXX., "<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>;" Vulgate, "qui egrediebatur et non revertebatur;" Alford, "it is hardly probable that it returned;" Murphy, "it did not need to return"). <span class="cmt_word">Until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</span> When of course its return was unnecessary. Cf. for a similar form of expression <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-23.htm">2 Samuel 6:23</a>. Whether it entirely disappeared at the first, or continued hovering round the ark, Noah was unable from its movements to arrive at any certain conclusion as to the condition of the earth, and accordingly required to adopt another expedient, which he did in the mission of the dove. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-12 The ark rested upon a mountain, whither it was directed by the wise and gracious providence of God, that might rest the sooner. God has times and places of rest for his people after their tossing; and many times he provides for their seasonable and comfortable settlement, without their own contrivance, and quite beyond their own foresight. God had told Noah when the flood would come, yet he did not give him an account by revelation, at what times and by what steps it should go away. The knowledge of the former was necessary to his preparing the ark; but the knowledge of the latter would serve only to gratify curiosity; and concealing it from him would exercise his faith and patience. Noah sent forth a raven from the ark, which went flying about, and feeding on the carcasses that floated. Noah then sent forth a dove, which returned the first time without good news; but the second time, she brought an olive leaf in her bill, plucked off, plainly showing that trees, fruit trees, began to appear above water. Noah sent forth the dove the second time, seven days after the first, and the third time was after seven days also; probably on the sabbath day. Having kept the sabbath with his little church, he expected especial blessings from Heaven, and inquired concerning them. The dove is an emblem of a gracious soul, that, finding no solid peace of satisfaction in this deluged, defiling world, returns to Christ as to its ark, as to its Noah, its rest. The defiling world, returns to Christ as to its ark, as to its Noah, its rest. The carnal heart, like the raven, takes up with the world, and feeds on the carrion it finds there; but return thou to my rest, O my soul; to thy Noah, so the word is, Ps 116:7. And as Noah put forth his hand, and took the dove, and pulled her to him, into the ark, so Christ will save, and help, and welcome those that flee to him for rest.</body></html>
