And now, wearied with the strife, he withdrew far away, and the Philistines, having gained their end, followed him no farther. In quiet, therefore, he again dug a well, and called it Rehoboth, <span class= "ital">wide open spaces. </span>It has been identified with one in the wady Ruhaibeh now stopped up, but originally twelve feet in diameter and cased with hewn stone. It lies to the south of Beer-sheba, at a distance of 8? leagues, and about forty miles; away from Gerar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaac digged again</span> - literally, <span class="accented">returned and digged</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. re-dug (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-5.htm">2 Kings 20:5</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">the wells of water, which they</span> (the servants of Abraham) <span class="cmt_word">had digged in the days Of Abraham his father</span>; - from which it appears that Abraham had digged other wells besides that of Beersheba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham</span>: - which was a violation of the league into which Abimelech had entered with the patriarch (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them</span> - and with which Isaac was sufficiently acquainted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:18-25 Isaac met with much opposition in digging wells. Two were called Contention and Hatred. See the nature of worldly things; they make quarrels, and are occasions of strife; and what is often the lot of the most quiet and peaceable; those who avoid striving, yet cannot avoid being striven with. And what a mercy it is to have plenty of water; to have it without striving for it! The more common this mercy is, the more reason to be thankful for it. At length Isaac digged a well, for which they strove not. Those that study to be quiet, seldom fail of being so. When men are false and unkind, still God is faithful and gracious; and his time to show himself so is, when we are most disappointed by men. The same night that Isaac came weary and uneasy to Beer-sheba, God brought comforts to his soul. Those may remove with comfort who are sure of God's presence.</body></html>
