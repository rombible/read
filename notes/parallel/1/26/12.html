Isaac and Jacob took a still further step in advance towards a settled life when they began to cultivate plots of ground. At first, however, Isaac did no more than the Bedaween do at present; for they often sow a piece of land, wait till the crop is ripe, and then resume their roving habits. Permanently to till the soil is with them a mark of inferiority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm" title="These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.">Genesis 25:16</a>). But the tendency, both with Abraham and Isaac, had long been to remain in the region about Beer-sheba. Isaac had been driven thence by the famine, by which he had probably lost much of his cattle, and many even of his people. Apparently he was even so weakened thereby as to be no match for the Philistines of Gerar. His large harvest recouped him for his losses, and made him once more a prosperous man; and in due time Beer-sheba was again his home, and with settled habits agriculture was�sure to begin.<p><span class= "bld">An hundredfold.</span>--The Heb. is, <span class= "ital">a hundred measures, </span>but the word is unknown elsewhere, and the LXX. and Syriac read, <span class= "ital">a hundred of barley, </span>measures being understood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-15.htm" title="Also he said, Bring the veil that you have on you, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.">Ruth 3:15</a>. Herodotus (Book i. 193) mentions two--and even three--hundredfold as possible in Babylonia; but our Lord seems to give one hundredfold as the extreme measure of productiveness in Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-8.htm" title="But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundred times, some sixty times, some thirty times.">Matthew 13:8</a>). Such a return, like Isaac's, would be rare and extraordinary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Isaac sowed in that land</span>, - viz., Philistia. Though a distinct advance on the purely nomadic life pursued by Abraham, this did not imply fixed property in, or even permanent settlement on, the soil, "but only annual tenancy" thereof. Robinson (1. 77) mentions a colony of the Tawarah Arabs, about fifty families, living near Abu Zabel, in Egypt, who cultivated the soil and yet dwelt in tents. "The Biblical patriarchs were not mere Bedawin wanderers, like those who now occupy the Eastern deserts. They had large herds of cattle, which genuine Bedawins have not; they tilled the ground, which these robbers never do; and they accommodated themselves, without difficulty or reluctance, to town and city when necessary, which wild Arabs cannot endure" ('Land and Book,' p. 296) - <span class="cmt_word">and received in the same year an hundred-fold</span> - literally, <span class="accented">an hundred measures</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for each measure of that which he sowed; an exceptional return even for Philistia, though "the country is no less fertile than the very best of the Mississippi Valley" ('Land and Book,' p. 557); and Arab grain stores at <span class="accented">Nuttar-abu-Sumar</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the vicinity of Gaza, still proclaim the remunerative yield of its harvests (Robinson, vol. 1. p. 292). Herodotus (1. 193) speaks of two and three hundred-fold as having been reaped on the plain of Babylonia; but in Palestine the usual rate of increase was from thirty to a hundred-fold (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>). The reading "an hundred of barley" (LXX., Syriac, Michaelis) is not to be preferred to that in the Textus Receptus. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord blessed him</span> - as he had promised (ver. 3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:12-17 God blessed Isaac. Be it observed, for the encouragement of poor tenants who occupy other people's lands, and are honest and industrious, that God blessed him with a great increase. The Philistines envied Isaac. It is an instance of the vanity of the world; for the more men have of it, the more they are envied, and exposed to censure and injury. Also of the corruption of nature; for that is an ill principle indeed, which makes men grieve at the good of others. They made Isaac go out of their country. That wisdom which is from above, will teach us to give up our right, and to draw back from contentions. If we are wrongfully driven from one place, the Lord will make room for us in another.</body></html>
