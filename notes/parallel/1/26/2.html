Excepting to Abraham, it was only at rare and distant intervals that God spake to the patriarchs. The greater part of their lives was spent under the control of the same ordinary Providence as that which governs our actions now; but on special occasions God was pleased to confirm their faith in Him in a way not necessary now that we have had made known to us the whole counsel of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> (Jehovah, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the God of the covenant and of the promise) appeared unto him, - only two Divine manifestations are mentioned as having been granted to the patriarch. Either the peaceful tenor of Isaac s life rendered more theophanies in his case unnecessary; or, if others were enjoyed by him, the brief space allotted by the historian to the record of his life may account for their omission from the narrative. Though commonly understood as having occurred in Gerar (Keil, Lange, Murphy), this appearance, is perhaps better regarded as having taken place at Lahai-roi, and as having been the cause of Isaac's turning aside into the land of the Philistines (Calvin) - <span class="cmt_word">and said, Go not down into Egypt</span> - whither manifestly he had been purposing to migrate, as his father had done on the occasion of the earlier dearth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>). Jacob in the later famine was instructed to go down to Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3, 4</a>); Abraham in the first scarcity was left at liberty to think and act for himself. Dwell in the land which I will tell thee of (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Philistia, as appears from the preceding verse). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-5 Isaac had been trained up in a believing dependence upon the Divine grant of the land of Canaan to him and his heirs; and now that there is a famine in the land, Isaac still cleaves to the covenant. The real worth of God's promises cannot be lessened to a believer by any cross providences that may befall him. If God engage to be with us, and we are where he would have us to be, nothing but our own unbelief and distrust can prevent our comfort. The obedience of Abraham to the Divine command, was evidence of that faith, whereby, as a sinner, he was justified before God, and the effect of that love whereby true faith works. God testifies that he approved this obedience, to encourage others, especially Isaac.</body></html>
