Isaac must have perfectly understood that the place had been so named by his father three quarters of a century previous; but either the name had been forgotten by others, or had not come into general use amongst the inhabitants, or, observing the coincidence between his finding a well just at the time of covenanting with Abimelech and the fact that his father's treaty was also connected with a well, he wished to confirm and perpetuate the early name which had been assigned to the town. It is not certain that this was Abraham s well which had been rediscovered; the probability is that it was another, since at Bir-es-Sheba two wells are still in existence (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>) unto this day - an expression used throughout Genesis to describe events separated from the age of Moses by several centuries (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-32.htm">Genesis 32:32</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:26-33 When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him, Pr 16:7.

But Isaac did not insist on the unkindnesses they had done him; he freely entered into friendship with them. Religion teaches us to be neighbourly, and, as much as in us lies, to live peaceable with all men. Providence smiled upon what Isaac did; God blessed his labours.</body></html>
