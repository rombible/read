By the long residence, first of Abraham and then of Isaac, in their territory, the Philistines would indeed have become better acquainted with the religion of the patriarchs; but as <span class= "ital">Jehovah </span>was not their special title for the Deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm" title="And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.">Exodus 6:3</a>), we must conclude, with Rosenmller, that it was Moses who wrote Jehovah in the place of the word actually employed by Abimelech. We gather, however, that the king did not use any generic or heathen names of the Deity, but that whereby the patriarchs worshipped their covenant God, and his so doing was probably intended as an act of homage to Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said, We saw certainly</span> - literally, <span class="accented">seeing we saw</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. we assuredly perceived, or, we have indeed discovered (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrews Synt.,' &sect; 312). Abimelech and his ministers first explain the motive which has impelled them to solicit a renewal of the old alliance - <span class="cmt_word">that the Lord was with thee</span>: - the use of Jehovah instead of Elohim, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>, does not prove that this is a Jehovistic elaboration of the earlier legend. Neither is it necessary to suppose that the term Jehovah is a Mosaic translation of the epithet employed by Abimelech (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The long-continued residence of Abraham in Gemr and Beersheba afforded ample opportunity for Abimelech becoming acquainted with the patriarch's God. The introduction of Jehovah into the narrative may be noted as a third point of dissimilarity between this and the previous account - <span class="cmt_word">and we said, Let there he now an oath</span> - i.e. a treaty secured by an oath or self-imprecation on the transgressor (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-41.htm">Genesis 24:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11, 13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee</span>, - a farther particularization of the parties to the covenant for the sake of emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">and let us make a covenant with thee</span>. The phrase "to cut a covenant," here used in a so-called Jehovistic portion of the history, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-27.htm">Genesis 21:27, 32</a>, which confessedly belongs to the fundamental document. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:26-33 When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him, Pr 16:7. Kings' hearts are in his hands, and when he pleases, he can turn them to favour his people. It is not wrong to stand upon our guard in dealing with those who have acted unfairly. But Isaac did not insist on the unkindnesses they had done him; he freely entered into friendship with them. Religion teaches us to be neighbourly, and, as much as in us lies, to live peaceable with all men. Providence smiled upon what Isaac did; God blessed his labours.</body></html>
