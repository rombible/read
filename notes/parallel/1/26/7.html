and we now find Isaac imitating his example with even less reason for his conduct. The circumstances are, however, different. It is the people who inquire about Isaac's relation to Rebekah, and though she was "fair to look upon," yet no annoyance followed upon his denial of her. The king after "a long time" detects their intimacy; but there are no presents, and no marks of respect to Rebekah, and no friendship. It is only after long quarrels, during which Isaac is obliged to withdraw to a long distance from Gerar, that finally peace is made between them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the men of the place</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the inhabitants of Gerar) <span class="cmt_word">asked him</span> (literally, asked, or made inquiries; probably first at each other, though ultimately the interrogations might reach Isaac himself) <span class="cmt_word">of his wife</span> (being in all likelihood fascinated by her beauty); <span class="cmt_word">and he said</span>, - falling into the same infirmity as Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">She is my sister</span>: - which was certainly an equivocation, since, although sometimes used to designate a female relative generally (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-60.htm">Genesis 24:60</a>), the term "sister" was here designed to suggest that Rebekah was his own sister, born of the same parents.

The temptation of Isaac is the same as that which overcame his father, and that in two instances. This rendered his conduct the greater sin. The falls of those who are gone before us are so many rocks on which others have split; and the recording of them is like placing buoys to save future mariners. This Abimelech was not the same that lived in Abraham's days, but both acted rightly. The sins of professors shame them before those that are not themselves religious.</body></html>
