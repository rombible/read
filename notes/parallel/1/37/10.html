Joseph's dream seemed to violate the respect due to parents. As Jacob probably regarded his son's dreams as the result of his letting his fancy dwell upon ideas of self-exaltation, he rightly rebuked him; while, nevertheless, "observing his saying." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thy mother.</span>--Rachel was certainly dead, as Joseph had at this time eleven brethren. Nor did Leah ever bow down before him; for she died at Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-31.htm" title="There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.">Genesis 49:31</a>). The enumeration of "sun, moon, and stars," means Jacob, his wives, and his children, that is, the whole family, elders and juniors, were to make obeisance to Joseph. It is a general phrase, like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-26.htm" title="And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.">Genesis 35:26</a>, and is not to be too literally interpreted. But as the handmaids were both of them younger than either Rachel or Leah, they may have gone down with Jacob into Egypt; and probably Bilhah had done a mother's part by Joseph after Rachel's death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he told it to his father, and to his brethren</span> - whom it manifestly concerned, as, for the like reason, he had reported the first dream only to his brethren. That he does not tell it to his mother may be an indication that Rachel was by this time dead. <span class="cmt_word">And his father rebuked him</span>, - either to avoid irritating his brethren (Calvin), or to repress an appearance of pride in Joseph (Lange, Murphy, Inglis), or to express his own surprise (Candlish) or irritation (Keil), or sense of the absurdity of the dream (Lawson), which he further demonstrated when he added - <span class="cmt_word">and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed! Shall I and thy mother</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Rachel, who was neither forgotten nor lost" (Keil), who may possibly have been living at the date of the dream ('Speaker's Commentary'), though then Joseph could not 'have had eleven brothers; who, being dead, was referred to in order to show the impossibility of its ever being fulfilled (Kalisch, Pererius); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Leah, as the chief mistress of Jacob's household (Willet, Hughes, Inglis); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Bilhah, Rachel,s maid, who had probably acted as Joseph s mother after Rachel's death (Jewish interpreters, Grotius, and others); or, what seems more probable, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the term "mother" is here introduced simply for the sake of giving completeness to the symbol (Kurtz, Murphy) - <span class="cmt_word">and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee</span> - Joseph's brethren ultimately did so in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-6.htm">Genesis 41:6</a>); Joseph's father practically did so when he recognized Joseph's greatness and depended on him for support (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-12.htm">Genesis 47:12</a>). It is certain that Leah died before the immigration to Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-31.htm">Genesis 49:31</a>), and it cannot be determined whether Bilhah or Zilpah went to Egypt - <span class="cmt_word">to the earth</span>. Jacob seems here, by intensifying Joseph's language, to resent the claim which it conveyed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:5-11 God gave Joseph betimes the prospect of his advancement, to support and comfort him under his long and grievous troubles. Observe, Joseph dreamed of his preferment, but he did not dream of his imprisonment. Thus many young people, when setting out in the world, think of nothing but prosperity and pleasure, and never dream of trouble. His brethren rightly interpreted the dream, though they abhorred the interpretation of it. While they committed crimes in order to defeat it, they were themselves the instruments of accomplishing it. Thus the Jews understood what Christ said of his kingdom. Determined that he should not reign over them, they consulted to put him to death; and by his crucifixion, made way for the exaltation they designed to prevent.</body></html>
