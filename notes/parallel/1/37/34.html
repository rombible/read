For not only his daughters, but "all his sons rose up to comfort him." Probably he had several daughters by Leah and the two handmaidens, Dinah alone having been mentioned by name, because two of her brothers forfeited the birthright by the cruelty with which they avenged her wrong. We learn how long and intense Jacob's sorrow was from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/45-26.htm" title="And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.">Genesis 45:26-28</a>. His daughters are mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm" title="His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.">Genesis 46:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins</span>, - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">el, frog, saccus</span>), the usual dress of mourners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-1.htm">Nehemiah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>), was a coarse, thick haircloth, of which corn sacks were also made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>), and which in cases of extreme mental distress was worn next the skin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and mourned for his son many days</span>. Though twenty-two years elapsed before Jacob again beheld his son, and though doubtless the old man's grief for the premature and, violent death, as he imagined, of Rachel s child was little abated by the lapse, of time, yet the expression "many days" may only be employed to mark the intensity of Jacob's sorrow, which continued longer than the customary mournings of the period. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:31-36 When Satan has taught men to commit one sin, he teaches them to try to conceal it with another; to hide theft and murder, with lying and false oaths: but he that covers his sin shall not prosper long. Joseph's brethren kept their own and one another's counsel for some time; but their villany came to light at last, and it is here published to the world. To grieve their father, they sent him Joseph's coat of colours; and he hastily thought, on seeing the bloody coat, that Joseph was rent in pieces. Let those that know the heart of a parent, suppose the agony of poor Jacob. His sons basely pretended to comfort him, but miserable, hypocritical comforters were they all. Had they really desired to comfort him, they might at once have done it, by telling the truth. The heart is strangely hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Jacob refused to be comforted. Great affection to any creature prepares for so much the greater affliction, when it is taken from us, or made bitter to us: undue love commonly ends in undue grief. It is the wisdom of parents not to bring up children delicately, they know not to what hardships they may be brought before they die. From the whole of this chapter we see with wonder the ways of Providence. The malignant brothers seem to have gotten their ends; the merchants, who care not what they deal in so that they gain, have also obtained theirs; and Potiphar, having got a fine young slave, has obtained his! But God's designs are, by these means, in train for execution. This event shall end in Israel's going down to Egypt; that ends in their deliverance by Moses; that in setting up the true religion in the world; and that in the spread of it among all nations by the gospel. Thus the wrath of man shall praise the Lord, and the remainder thereof will he restrain.</body></html>
