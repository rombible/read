JOSEPH IS SOLD BY HIS BRETHREN INTO EGYPT.</span><p>(2) <span class= "bld">The generations of Jacob.</span>--This <span class= "ital">Toldoth, </span>according to the undeviating rule, is the history of Jacob's descendants, and specially of Joseph. So the <span class= "ital">Toldoth </span>of the heaven and earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a>) gives the history of the creation and fall of man. So the <span class= "ital">Toldoth Adam </span>was the history of the flood; and, not to multiply instances, that of Terah was the history of Abraham. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-10.htm" title="And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.">Genesis 28:10</a>.) This <span class= "ital">Toldoth, </span>therefore, extends to the end of Genesis, and is the history of the removal, through Joseph's instrumentality, of the family of Jacob from Canaan into Egypt, as a step preparatory to its growth into a nation.<p><span class= "bld">Joseph being seventeen years old.</span>--He was born about seven years before Jacob left Haran, and as the journey home probably occupied two full years, he would have dwelt in Isaac's neighbourhood for seven or eight years. Isaac's life, as we have seen, was prolonged for about twelve years after the sale of Joseph by his brethren.<p><span class= "bld">And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">And he was lad with the sons of Bilhah, </span>&c. The probable meaning of this is, that as the youngest son it was his duty to wait upon his brothers, just as David had to look after the sheep, while his brothers went to the festival; and was also sent to the camp to attend to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-11.htm" title="And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come here.">1Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-17.htm" title="And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brothers;">1Samuel 17:17-18</a>). The sons of Jacob were dispersed in detachments over the large extent of country occupied by Jacob's cattle, and Joseph probably after his mother's death, when he was about nine years' old, would be brought up in the tent of Bilhah, his mother's handmaid. He would naturally, therefore, go with her sons, with whom were also the sons of the other handmaid. They do not seem to have taken any special part in Joseph's sale.<p><span class= "bld">Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Joseph brought an evil report of them unto their father.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the generations of Jacob</span>.

Pererius, following the Vulgate, connects the clause with what precedes; Calvin, Dathius, Lange, Murphy, Kalisch, and others conjoin it with the words that follow; the LXX., Willet, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Ainsworth, Bush, etc. regard it as a parenthetical statement - <span class="cmt_word">with</span> - not in the capacity of a servant (Vatablus) or of a ward (Kalisch), but of a companion - <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives.</span> With these rather than the sons of Leah, as being less supercilious and haughty than the children of the first wife (Lawson), or as being less opposed to him than they (Lange), or more probably as being nearer to his own age than they (Keil), or perhaps as having been brought more into contact with the handmaids' children, and in particular with those of Bilhah, Rachel's maid, who may have been to him as a mother after Rachel's death (Rosenm&uuml;ller). <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph brought unto his</span> (rather, their) <span class="cmt_word">father their evil report</span>.

It also shows the lot of Christians, who must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom. It is a history that has none like it, for displaying the various workings of the human mind, both good and bad, and the singular providence of God in making use of them for fulfilling his purposes. Though Joseph was his father's darling, yet he was not bred up in idleness. Those do not truly love their children, who do not use them to business, and labour, and hardships. The fondling of children is with good reason called the spoiling of them. Those who are trained up to do nothing, are likely to be good for nothing. But Jacob made known his love, by dressing Joseph finer than the rest of his children. It is wrong for parents to make a difference between one child and another, unless there is great cause for it, by the children's dutifulness, or undutifulness. When parents make a difference, children soon notice it, and it leads to quarrels in families. Jacob's sons did that, when they were from under his eye, which they durst not have done at home with him; but Joseph gave his father an account of their ill conduct, that he might restrain them. Not as a tale-bearer, to sow discord, but as a faithful brother.</body></html>
