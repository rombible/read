This has been made into a difficulty, but really it confirms the truth of the narrative. For the difficulty arises solely from the supposition that Joseph's brethren immediately after casting him into the pit "sat down to eat bread," an act well described as most cold-blooded. But they were not actually guilty of it; for what the narrative says is that they were having their evening meal when the caravan came in sight. Reuben, between the casting of Joseph into the pit and the evening meal, had apparently gone a long round to fetch in the more distant cattle, and probably had remained away as long as possible, in order to feel sure that his brethren would on his return be at their dinner. He hoped thus to be able to go alone to the cistern, and rescue Joseph, and send him away home before the rest could interfere. Thus rightly understood, it is a proof of the trustworthiness of the history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Reuben</span> (in whose absence apparently the scheme of sale had been concocted and carried through) <span class="cmt_word">returned to the pit</span> (obviously with a view to deliver Joseph); <span class="cmt_word">and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes</span> - a token of his mingled grief and horror at the discovery (cf. ver. 34; 44:13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-31.htm">2 Samuel 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child</span> (or young man, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> in the one hemistich is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> in the other) is not; <span class="cmt_word">and I, whither shall I go</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> however shall I account for his disappearance? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:23-30 They threw Joseph into a pit, to perish there with hunger and cold; so cruel were their tender mercies. They slighted him when he was in distress, and were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph, see Am 6:6; for when he was pining in the pit, they sat down to eat bread. They felt no remorse of conscience for the sin. But the wrath of man shall praise God, and the remainder of wrath he will restrain, Ps 76:10. Joseph's brethren were wonderfully restrained from murdering him, and their selling him as wonderfully turned to God's praise.</body></html>
