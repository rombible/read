It implies that the sheaf took the position of chief. We gather from this dream that Jacob practised agriculture, not occasionally, as had been the case with Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-12.htm" title="Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundred times: and the LORD blessed him.">Genesis 26:12</a>), but regularly, as seems to have been usual also at Haran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-14.htm" title="And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son's mandrakes.">Genesis 30:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>behold, we were binding sheaves</span> - literally, binding <span class="accented">things</span> bound, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sheaves, <span class="accented">alumim</span>, from <span class="accented">alam</span>, to bind; the order of the words and the participial form of the verb indicating that the speaker describes the vision as it appeared to his mind (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald, 'Hebrews Synt.,' &sect; 342) - <span class="cmt_word">in the field</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">in the middle of the field</span>; from which it would appear that Jacob was not a mere nomad, but carried on agricultural operations like his father Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and, lo</span>, - "the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>, as repeated in his narration, shows that he had a presentiment of something great" (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">my sheaf arose, and also stood upright</span> (literally, <span class="accented">stood, i.e.</span> placed itself upright, and remained so); <span class="cmt_word">and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bowed themselves down (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>, Abraham bowing to the Hethites) - <span class="cmt_word">to my sheaf</span>.

Observe, Joseph dreamed of his preferment, but he did not dream of his imprisonment. Thus many young people, when setting out in the world, think of nothing but prosperity and pleasure, and never dream of trouble. His brethren rightly interpreted the dream, though they abhorred the interpretation of it. While they committed crimes in order to defeat it, they were themselves the instruments of accomplishing it. Thus the Jews understood what Christ said of his kingdom. Determined that he should not reign over them, they consulted to put him to death; and by his crucifixion, made way for the exaltation they designed to prevent.</body></html>
