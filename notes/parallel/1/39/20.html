<span class="accented">sohar</span>, from <span class="accented">sahar, to</span> encircle, meaning probably a turreted, arched, or rounded building for the confinement of prisoners - <span class="cmt_word">a place where the king's prisoners</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> State offenders) <span class="cmt_word">were bound: and he was there in the prison</span>. This, which some regard as having been a mild punishment (Delitzsch, Keil), since, according to Diodorus Siculus, the laws of the Egyptians were specially severe in their penalties for offences against women, is represented by a Hebrew psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-18.htm">Psalm 105:18</a>) as having been accompanied with bodily tortures, at least for a time; for his speedy elevation to a place of trust within the prison almost gives countenance to the idea (Kurtz, Lange, etc.) that Potiphar did not believe his wife's story, and only incarcerated Joseph for the sake of appearances. That Joseph was not immediately punished with death is not improbable (Bohlen), but exceedingly natural, since Joseph was Potiphar's favorite (Havernick). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:19-23 Joseph's master believed the accusation. Potiphar, it is likely, chose that prison, because it was the worst; but God designed to open the way to Joseph's honour. Joseph was owned and righted by his God. He was away from all his friends and relations; he had none to help or comfort him; but the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy. Those that have a good conscience in a prison, have a good God there. God gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison; he trusted him to manage the affairs of the prison. A good man will do good wherever he is, and will be a blessing even in bonds and banishment. Let us not forget, through Joseph, to look unto Jesus, who suffered being tempted, yet without sin; who was slandered, and persecuted, and imprisoned, but without cause; who by the cross ascended to the throne. May we be enabled to follow the same path in submitting and in suffering, to the same place of glory.</body></html>
