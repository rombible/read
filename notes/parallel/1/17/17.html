Still with belief there was surprise, and the feeling that what was promised was so strange as to be well-nigh incredible.

As for Sarah, there is no proof that at the time when she laughed she knew or even suspected that the three travellers were more than men. She overheard their conversation, and laughed, imagining perhaps that they did not know how old she was. Really, the idea brought out by this double laughter is that Isaac's birth was contrary to nature.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Abraham fell upon his face</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">and laughed.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, to laugh.

A suggestion of natural reason which was overruled by faith (Calvin, Wordsworth), though better regarded as the exclamation of holy wonder, or as an illustration of believing not for joy (Inglis; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</span> Yes. What reason declared impossible was possible to faith. "He considered not the deadness of Sarah s womb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:15-22 Here is the promise made to Abraham of a son by Sarai, in whom the promise made to him should be fulfilled. The assurance of this promise was the change of Sarai's name into Sarah. Sarai signifies my princess, as if her honour were confined to one family only; Sarah signifies a princess. The more favours God confers upon us, the more low we should be in our own eyes. Abraham showed great joy; he laughed, it was a laughter of delight, not of distrust. Now it was that Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day; now he saw it and was glad, Joh 8:56. Abraham, dreading lest Ishmael should be abandoned and forsaken of God, put up a petition on his behalf. God gives us leave in prayer to be particular in making known our requests. Whatever is our care and fear, should be spread before God in prayer. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and the great thing we should desire is, that they may be kept in covenant with Him, and may have grace to walk before him in uprightness. Common blessings are secured to Ishmael. Outward good things are often given to those children of godly parents who are born after the flesh, for their parents' sake. Covenant blessings are reserved for Isaac, and appropriated to him.</body></html>
