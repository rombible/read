<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-16.htm" title="He has said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:">Numbers 24:16</a>); by Naomi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-20.htm" title="And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.">Ruth 1:20</a>); and in the Book of Job, where it occurs thirty-one times. We may thus regard it as <span class= "ital">"</span>one of the more general worldwide titles of the Most High" (Speaker's Commentary). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm" title="And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.">Exodus 6:3</a> it is said, with evident reference to this place, that El shaddai was the name of God revealed to the patriarchs, but that He was not known to them by His name Jehovah. Here, nevertheless, in a passage said by commentators to be Elohistic, we read that "Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said to him I am El shaddai." But the very gist of the passage is the identification of Jehovah and El shaddai, and the great object of the manifest care with which Moses distinguishes the Divine names seems to be to show, that though Jehovah became the special name of Elohim in His covenant relation to Israel after the Exodus, yet that the name was one old and primeval (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm" title="And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 4:26</a>), and that the God of revelation, under various titles, was ever one and the same. And so is it now, though we, by following a Jewish superstition, have well-nigh forfeited the use of the name Jehovah, so greatly prized of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm" title="And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.">Genesis 4:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Walk before me.</span>--The same verb as that used of Enoch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-22.htm" title="And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:">Genesis 5:22</a>), and of Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>), but the preposition <span class= "ital">before </span>implies less closeness than <span class= "ital">with. </span>On the other hand, Noah was described as "perfect among his contemporaries" (<span class= "ital">ibid.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>while Abram is required still to strive after this integrity (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Abram was ninety years old and nine</span> - consequently an interval of thirteen years had elapsed since the birth of Ishmael; the long delay on the part of God being probably designed as chastisement for Abram's second nuptials (Calvin), and at least corresponding with Abram's undue haste (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">the Lord appeared to Abram</span> - lest he should regard Ishmael's birth as a complete fulfillment of the promise (Menochius), and be satisfied with Hagar's child as the expected seed (Calvin) - <span class="cmt_word">and said to him, I am the Almighty God</span> - <span class="accented">El Shaddai</span>, found six times in Genesis and thirty-one times in Job, composed of El, God, and <span class="accented">Shaddai</span>; not a <span class="accented">nomen compositum</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;</span> = <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>) signifying <span class="accented">qui sufficiens est</span> (Aquinas, Symmachus, Theodoret, Saadias, Maimonides, Calvin), but either a <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span>., from the singular <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, powerful - root <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, to be strong (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Wordsworth), or a singular from the same root with the substantive termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;</span>, as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, the festal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, the old man, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, the thorn-grown (Keil, Oehler, Lange); descriptive of God as revealing himself violently in his might, hence correctly rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span> by the LXX. in Job (Oehler); distinguishing Jehovah, the God of salvation, from Elohim, the God who creates nature so that it is and supports it that it may stand, as "<span class="accented">the</span> God who compels nature to do what is contrary to itself, and subdues it to bow and minister to grace" (Delitzsch); characterizing Jehovah the covenant God, "as possessing the power to realize his promises, even when the order of nature presented no prospect of their fulfillment, and the powers of nature were insufficient to secure it" (Keil); perhaps, like Elohim and Adonai, one of the world-wide titles of the Most High since it was known to Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16</a>), and is constantly used in Job ('Speaker's Commentary'). Said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-2.htm">Exodus 6:2, 3</a> to have been the name by which God was known to the patriarchs, it is regarded by the partitionists as characteristic of the Elohist (Tuch, Blcek, Colenso, Davidson, Ewald), and accordingly to that writer the present chapter is assigned, and the Jehovah of this verse expiated as an alteration of the original Elohist's narrative; but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of this criticism lurks in the identification of El-Shaddai with Elohim, whereas it is not Elohim, but Jehovah, who reveals himself as E1 Shaddai not alone in the Pentateuch, but in the historical and prophetical books as well (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20, 21</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Keil's Introduction, pt. &sect; 2; div. 1. &sect; 25). <span class="cmt_word">Walk before me</span>.

The phrase intimates a less exalted piety than the corresponding phrase used of Enoch (5. 24) and Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And be thou perfect</span>. <span class="accented">Tamim</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), used of Noah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, and rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), while perhaps retrospectively glancing at Abram's sin in marrying Hagar, indicates that absolute standard of moral attainment, viz., completeness of being in respect of purity, which the supreme Lawgiver sets before his intelligent creatures (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 The covenant was to be accomplished in due time.
