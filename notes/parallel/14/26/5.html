The chariness of the narrative in this exact respect is not very explicable, for if the simple reason be assumed to be that they were not of much repute, now when the name of <span class="accented">Zechariah</span> is given, all that we can say is that nothing else is known of him. <span class="cmt_word">Had understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. There seems no reason to divest this hiph. conjugation form of its stricter signification, "gave understanding "(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-14.htm">Isaiah 40:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the visions of God;</span> Hebrew<span class="cmt_word">,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. Some slight discrepancy in the usual fuller writing of the word in some manuscripts lends a little ground of preference for the reading, which a few manuscripts evidently had (see Septuagint Version, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span>,), of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in the fear of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3</a>); either reading in either of these sub-clauses leaves an undisturbed good meaning to the description of Zechariah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-15 As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him to prosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.</body></html>
