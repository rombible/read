Azareel--Uzziel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-4.htm" title="Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:">1Chronicles 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-18.htm" title="The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brothers, were twelve:">1Chronicles 25:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Uzziah</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. (signifying "Strength of Jehovah"). Once in Chronicles, and once only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a>), this king's name is given <span class="accented">Azariah</span>, Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (signifying "Help of Jehovah") or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>; and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>, etc.), Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1</a>, etc.), and Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>, etc.) always use the word <span class="accented">Uzziah.</span> In the parallel, however, and in both the chapters in which the parallel clauses lie, the word <span class="accented">Azariah</span> is used, as well in other clauses as in those (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-1.htm">2 Kings 15:1, 6, 8, 23, 27</a>), yet <span class="accented">Uzziah</span> is also used in verses intermingled with them (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> 13, 30, 32, 34). It is probable that Azariah was the first-used name, that the latter name was not a corruption of the former, but that, for whatever reason, the king was called by both names. Nevertheless, the apt analogy that has been pointed out of Uzziel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>) and Azareel (18) is noteworthy. (See Keil and Bertheau on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>; and Keil on our present passage.) <span class="cmt_word">Sixteen years old</span>. Therefore Uzziah must have been born just before the fatal outside mistake of his father's life in the challenge he sent to Joash of Israel, and after the deadly inner mistake of his soul in turning aside to "the gods of the children of Seir." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-15 As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him to prosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.</body></html>
