Although, as just suggested, it were conceivable that to Uzziah himself was due in part the invention or the great improving of the machines in question, yet the verse may be regarded as simply saying that the <span class="accented">introduction</span> of them into Jerusalem was his work. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">was marvellously helped</span> (see ver. 7). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-15 As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him to prosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.</body></html>
