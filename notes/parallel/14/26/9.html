For the corner gate, see our note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-23.htm">2 Chronicles 25:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Valley gate</span>. This is called by some the Gehenna gate. As many as three sites, reducible perhaps to two, are proposed for this gate: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the west gate, called somewhile the "Jaffa" gate; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a gate over the valley of" Hinnom;" or, if it be not the same, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that at the valley of Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">And at the turning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. This word occurs eleven times, viz. twice in Exodus, four times in Nehemiah, four times in Ezekiel, and in this place, and is always rendered "corner" or" turning;" the word wanted is <span class="accented">angle.</span> The site of this gate cannot very certainly be pronounced upon. Perhaps the angle that marks the gate is that at the south-east corner of the temple plateau. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a> is our best clue: "Next to him Ezer repaired... a piece over against the going up to the armoury <span class="accented">at the turning."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-15 As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him to prosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.</body></html>
