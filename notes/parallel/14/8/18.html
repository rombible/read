To what port the vessels were sent is not expressly stated. Probably they put in at Joppa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 2:16</a>). Others assume the meaning to be that the ships were sent from Tyre to Ezion-geber, and then ask whether they were dragged across the desert which divides the Mediterranean from the gulf of Akaba, or whether they circumnavigated Africa. The dilemma is only apparent. The Greek historians of later times often speak of the transport of ships overland; and the galleys of Solomon's age were probably small. Even the circumnavigation of Africa was achieved by a Ph?nician expedition sent out by Necho about four centuries later (Herod, iv. 42). But neither alternative seems necessary. If Huram provided Solomon with skilled mariners, they would naturally sail from Tyre to Joppa in their own ships. The Tyrian vessels may have been left at Joppa, while a portion of their crews proceeded, by Solomon's order, to Ezion-geber. In short, "ships and servants" means "ships <span class= "ital">with</span> servants," or "ships conveying servants."<p><span class= "bld">And they went.</span>--Huram's mariners. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-27.htm" title="And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.">1Kings 9:27</a> : "And Huram sent in the fleet (which Solomon had built) his servants, men of ships that had knowledge of the sea."

But it is almost impossible to see how he could do so. The parallel much helps us, by saying that "Solomon made a navy," and Hiram assisted. by manning it with competent sailors; he "sent in the navy his servants," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26, 27</a>). Some have suggested that the explanation is that Hiram gave materials, workmen, and models for Solomon's ships, possibly having ships lying in the Red Sea. The parallel, however, meets all difficulties, and saves the necessity of going far for farfetched explanations. <span class="cmt_word">Ophir</span>. This was the name of the son of Joktan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25-29</a>), who, it is supposed, gave his name to the place or land in the south of Arabia. It is still quite an unsettled question, however, where Ophir was situated, though an Arabian situation is on every account the most probable (see Exposition <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a>; and Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:637-642). Our four hundred and fifty talents of gold reads in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>) as "four hundred and twenty." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1 - 18 Solomon's buildings and trade. - It sometimes requires more wisdom and resolution to govern a family in the fear of God, than to govern a kingdom with reputation. The difficulty is increased, when a man has a hinderance instead of a help meet in the wife of his bosom. Solomon kept up the holy sacrifices, according to the law of Moses. In vain had the altar been built, in vain had fire come down from heaven, if sacrifices had not been constantly brought. Spiritual sacrifices are required of us, which we are to bring daily and weekly; it is good to be in a settled method of devotion. When the service of the temple was put into good order, it is said, The house of the Lord was perfected. The work was the main matter, not the place; the temple was unfinished till all this was done. Canaan was a rich country, and yet must send to Ophir for gold The Israelites were a wise people, but must be beholden to the king of Tyre for men that had knowledge of the seas. Grace, and not gold, is the best riches, and acquaintance with God and his law, the best knowledge. Leaving the children of this world to scramble for the toys of this world, may we, as the children of God, lay up our treasure in heaven, that where our treasure is, our hearts also may be.</body></html>
