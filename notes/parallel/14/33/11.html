The progress of cuneiform research, however, has proved the perfect possibility of the facts most disputed, viz., the captivity and subsequent restoration of Manasseh.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Wherefore.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span><p><span class= "bld">The captains of the host of the king of Assyria.</span>--The generals of Esarhaddon, or rather, perhaps, of Assurbanipal. The former, who reigned from 681-668 B.C. , has recorded the fact that Manasseh was his vassal. He says: "And I assembled the kings of the land of Hatti, and the marge of the sea, Baal king of Tyre, Me-na-si-e (or Mi-in-si-e) king of Ya-u-di (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Judah), Qa-us-gabri, king of Edom," &c. "Altogether, twenty-two kings of the land of Hatti [Syria], the coast of the sea, and the middle of the sea, all of them, I caused to hasten," &c. Assurbanipal has left a list which is identical with that of Esarhaddon, except that it gives different names for the kings of Arvad and Ammon. It thus appears that Manasseh paid tribute to him as well as to his father. Schrader (<span class= "ital">K.A.T.,</span> p. 367, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) thinks that Manasseh was at least suspected of being implicated along with the other princes of Phoenicia-Palestine in the revolt of Assurbanipars brother <span class= "ital">Samar-sum-ukin</span> (circ. 648-647 B.C. ) in which Elam, Gutium, and Meroe also participated; and that he was carried to Babylon, to clear himself of suspicion, and to give assurances of his fidelity to the great king.<p><span class= "bld">Which took Manasseh among the thorns.</span>--<span class= "ital">And they took Manasseh prisoner with the hooks</span> (<span class= "ital">ba-h?oh?im</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The <span class= "ital">hooks</span> might be such as the Assyrian kings were wont to pass through the nostrils and lips of their more distinguished prisoners. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-29.htm" title="Because your rage against me, and your tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.">Isaiah 37:29</a>, "I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips;" and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm" title="The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness, that, see, the days shall come on you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.">Amos 4:2</a>, "He will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fish-hooks." Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm" title="Can you put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?">Job 41:2</a>, "Canst thou bore his jaw with a hook?" [The LXX., Vulg., Targ. render the word "chains." Syriac confuses the word with <span class= "ital">chayyim,</span> "life," and renders "took Manasseh in his life."] Perhaps, however, the meaning is, <span class= "ital">and they took Manasseh prisoner at Hohim.</span> There is no reason why Hohim should not be a local name, as well as Coz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-8.htm" title="And Coz begat Anub, and Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel the son of Harum.">1Chronicles 4:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And bound him with fetters.</span>--<span class= "ital">With the double chain of bronze,</span> as the Philistines bound Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm" title="But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.">Judges 16:21</a>). So Sennacherib relates: "Suzubu king of Babylon, in the battle alive their hands took him; in fetters of bronze they put him, and to my presence brought him. In the great gate in the midst of the city of Nineveh I bound him fast." This happened in 695 B.C., only a few years before the similar captivity of Manasseh.<p><span class= "bld">And carried him.</span>--<span class= "ital">Caused him to go,</span> or <span class= "ital">led him away.</span><p><span class= "bld">To Babylon.</span>--Where Assurbanipal was holding his court at the time, as he appears to have done after achieving the overthrow of his brother the rebellious viceroy, and assuming the title of king of Babylon himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The contents of this and the following six verses (to the seventeenth) are not in the parallel, though their place there is plain.

Deprived of his liberty, separated from his evil counsellors and companions, without any prospect but of ending his days in a wretched prison, Manasseh thought upon what had passed; he began to cry for mercy and deliverance. He confessed his sins, condemned himself, was humbled before God, loathing himself as a monster of impiety and wickedness. Yet he hoped to be pardoned through the abundant mercy of the Lord. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah was God, able to deliver. He knew him as a God of salvation; he learned to fear, trust in, love, and obey him. From this time he bore a new character, and walked in newness of life. Who can tell what tortures of conscience, what pangs of grief, what fears of wrath, what agonizing remorse he endured, when he looked back on his many years of apostacy and rebellion against God; on his having led thousands into sin and perdition; and on his blood-guiltiness in the persecution of a number of God's children? And who can complain that the way of heaven is blocked up, when he sees such a sinner enter? Say the worst against thyself, here is one as bad who finds the way to repentance. Deny not to thyself that which God hath not denied to thee; it is not thy sin, but thy impenitence, that bars heaven against thee.</body></html>
