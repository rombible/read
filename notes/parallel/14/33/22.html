The statement of our text seems to imply that the "carven images" made by Manasseh had not been destroyed, but only cast aside. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-15.htm" title="And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.">2Chronicles 33:15</a>.) It argues a defect of judgment to say with Reuss that the reforms of Manasseh are rendered doubtful by it. The whole history is a succession of reforms followed by relapses; and the words of the sacred writer need not be supposed to mean that the images which Amon worshipped were the very ones which his penitent father had discarded, but only images of the same imaginary gods.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:21-25 Amon's father did ill, but he did worse. Whatever warnings or convictions he had, he never humbled himself. He was soon cut off in his sins, and made a warning for all men not to abuse the example of God's patience and mercy to Manasseh, as an encouragement to continue in sin. May God help us to be honest to ourselves, and to think aright respecting our own character, before death fixes us in an unchangeable state.</body></html>
