but some MSS. contain it. The repetition of his age, &c, is curious. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-6.htm" title="And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he worked that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.">2Chronicles 21:6</a>.) It seems to indicate that the writer was here transcribing from another source.<p><span class= "bld">And departed without being desired.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he departed without regret, died unregretted. Hemd?h</span> answers to the Latin <span class= "ital">desiderium.</span> The LXX. and Vulg. render: "And he walked not in approbation," or "rightly." Comp. Jeremiah's prophecy concerning the end of king Jehoiakim: <span class= "ital">"</span>They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah, my brother!" &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>). So Syriac and Arabic.<p><span class= "bld">Howbeit.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span><p><span class= "bld">They buried him.</span>--LXX., Syriac, and Arabic: "He was buried."<p><span class= "bld">But not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm" title="And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.">2Chronicles 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-23.htm" title="So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.">2Chronicles 26:23</a>. Another circumstance of dishonour. It is not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-17.htm" title="Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.">2Kings 8:17</a>. Thenius asserts that in these additions to the history of Jehoram there is traceable, not only a traditional or legendary element, but also pure <span class= "ital">embellishment</span> on the part of the chronicler. The grounds he alleges, however, by no means necessitate his conclusion, being themselves misinterpretations of the statements of Kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Departed without being desired</span>; literally, <span class="accented">without desire</span>. The closing commentary, so quietly written, becomes the more pathetically mournful The "desire" spoken of is the <span class="accented">desiderium</span> of Horace, of nearly nine centuries later ('Odes,' L 24). But there was now no "desiderium... tam cari capitis," for want of room for this latter description. <span class="cmt_word">They buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings</span> (see again our note on 2 Chronicles 16:14; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.</body></html>
