but they were not seen without. And there it is to this day.">2Chronicles 5:9</a>. The date thus assigned is some time prior to the captivity. No account is taken of Amaziah's reduction of Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/25-11.htm" title="And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.">2Chronicles 25:11-15</a>), which was probably not permanent.<p><span class= "bld">The same time also.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">then revolted Libnah at that time.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm" title="Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.">2Kings 8:22</a> ends here. The chronicler adds, "from under his (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Jehoram's) hand," and assigns a moral ground for the successful rebellion: "For he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers." (Thenius can hardly be right in asserting that the chronicler meant to say that Libnah, <span class= "ital">as a city of the priests,</span> refused obedience to the idolatrous king; nor Hitzig, in explaining the revolt as merely a <span class= "ital">religious</span> secession. ) He forsook Jehovah, by "walking in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by adopting and popularising the worship of the Tyrian Baal, to please his wife and her people. In those days friendship with an alien race seems to have involved recognition of their gods. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-9.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:">Amos 1:9</a> for the alliance between Tyre and Judah.)<p><span class= "bld">Libnah.</span>--Syriac, "the Edomites that lived in Libnah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Libnah... because he had forsaken.</span> The parallel states the revolt of Libnah also, but does not make the closing remark of our verse. Ver. 11 - <span class="cmt_word">Caused... to commit fornication</span>. Perhaps the meaning is exclusively here the infidelity of idolatry, but at any rate it includes this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 Jehoram hated his brethren, and slew them, for the same reason that Cain hated Abel, and slew him, because their piety condemned his impiety. In the mystery of Providence such men sometimes prosper for a time; but the Lord has righteous purposes in permitting such events, part of which may now be made out, and the rest will be seen hereafter.</body></html>
