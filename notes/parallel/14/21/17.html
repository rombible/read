The desire to be concise accounts for both omissions. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest.

The elementary idea of the root is to <span class="accented">divide</span>; and it occurs in one conjugation or another fifty-one times, there being no more typical occurrence than that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Carried away</span>. The Hebrew uses the word "carried captive" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>); possibly the order of ver. 14 is inadvertently neglected, which puts the living beings before all the substance, or, <span class="accented">goods</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>). His sons also. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a> we note that the sons were not punished for their father's sins alone, but for their own. <span class="cmt_word">Jehoahaz</span>. This person is called <span class="accented">Ahaziah in</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a> (the syllables of the name being reversed) and <span class="accented">Azariah</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-6.htm">2 Chronicles 22:6</a>, which cannot be explained, but must be supposed an error. The Jehoiachin of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> is written <span class="accented">Jeconiah</span>, or <span class="accented">Jechoniah</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16, 17</a>; <span class="accented">Coniah</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, etc.; and <span class="accented">Jechoniah</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1</a>, etc. The two parts of the word combined in either order make the same meaning. On account of the express mention of the camp in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>, some think that the slaughter and the plunder were all such as might have been wrought in the royal quarters <span class="accented">there</span>; others that we are to infer the taking by assault of Jerusalem itself and what was therein. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.</body></html>
