This is the word used so often for the "hand," but the essential idea of which is the <span class="accented">hollow</span> of either hand or foot or other thing, and among other things of a spoon shape. The word is used of the frankincense-cups (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-14.htm">Numbers 7:14, 20, 26</a>) brought to the dedication of the tabernacle by the several princes. <span class="cmt_word">The censers;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. These were "snuff-dishes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-9.htm">Numbers 4:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The entry</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the house;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>. Some think this word refers to the <span class="accented">door-frames</span>, as distinct from the door-leaves or doors themselves. But the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>) gives us what is translated as "hinges" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), a word that occurs only here in any such sense, as presumably (Gesenius, ' Lexicon ') "the hollowed part of a hinge," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-17.htm">Isaiah 3:17</a> for the <span class="accented">pudenda muliebria.</span> The mistaken transcribing of a <span class="accented">kheth</span> for a <span class="accented">tau </span>will amply account for the difference. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-22 The furniture of the temple. - Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.</body></html>
