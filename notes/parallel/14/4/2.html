The resemblance of the one word to the other would be a further consideration in its favour, according to ancient notions of interpretation.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A molten sea</span>. The Hebrew of this verse and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> are facsimiles of one author, except that here <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> stands, where the parallel shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, probably the fruit merely of some error in transcription. Verses like these point not to the derivation of Chronicles from Kings, but rather of both from some older common source. This sea of brass superseded the laver of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-9.htm">Exodus 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a>). It was called a sea on account of its size. We are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a> whence David had drawn the supplies of metal necessary for this work. The size of the diameter measured from upper rim to rim (ten cubits) harmonizes, of course, to all practical purposes, with that of the circumference (thirty cubits); it would assist questions connected with the contents of this large vessel, however, if we had been told whether the circumference were measured at the rim, or, as the form of language here used might slightly favour, round the girth. (For these questions, see ver. 5 below.) This sea for the washing of the priests significantly follows the altar. Beside the general suggestion of the need of purification or sanctification, it here reminds of the fact that the earthly priest and high priest must need the purification, which their great Antitype would not need. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-22 The furniture of the temple. - Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.</body></html>
