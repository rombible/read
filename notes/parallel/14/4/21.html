It is derived from <span class= "ital">k?l?h,</span> "to be finished," not <span class= "ital">k?lal</span> (Bishop Wordsworth). The LXX. omits the clause; not so the Vulg., which renders "all were made of purest gold." This little touch, added to heighten the effect, is quite in the manner of the chronicler, and is certainly not to be suspected, as Z�ckler asserts. Perhaps we should read <span class= "ital">miklol, "</span>perfection" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm" title="She doted on the Assyrians her neighbors, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.">Ezekiel 23:12</a>), instead of the isolated <span class= "ital">mikloth.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the snuffers.</span>--Before this expression, <span class= "ital">and the basons</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm" title="And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.">1Kings 7:50</a>) has probably fallen out.<p><span class= "bld">Snuffers.</span>--<span class= "ital">Shears</span> or <span class= "ital">scissors,</span> for trimming the lamps.<p><span class= "bld">The spoons, and the censers.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">trays and snuff-dishes.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm" title="And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.">1Kings 7:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-38.htm" title="And the tongs thereof, and the firepans thereof, shall be of pure gold.">Exodus 25:38</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And the entry of the house.</span>--Including both the doors of the nave or holy place, and those of the chancel or holiest. The words are explained by those which follow: "viz., its inner doors to the holy of holies and the doors of the house--viz., to the nave (<span class= "ital">heh?l,</span> great hall)." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm" title="And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.">1Kings 7:50</a> we read, "And the <span class= "ital">hinges</span> to the doors of the inner house--viz., the holy of holies, (and) to the doors of the house--viz., to the nave, were of gold." The word rendered <span class= "ital">hinges</span> (<span class= "ital">pothoth</span>) resembles that rendered <span class= "ital">entry</span> (<span class= "ital">pethah</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> and some have supposed that the latter is a corruption of the former, and would alter our text accordingly. Two reasons seem to be decisive against such a change. (1) <span class= "ital">Pothoth, "</span>hinges," occurs nowhere else in the Bible; and may not be genuine. It is likely enough that the doors of the Temple were plated with gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-32.htm" title="The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.">1Kings 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-35.htm" title="And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.">1Kings 6:35</a>), but hardly that their hinges were made of gold.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The flowers</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, occurring sixteen times, of which number it is translated" flowers "thirteen times, "buds" twice, and "blossom" once. The <span class="accented">flower was</span> a part of the ornamentation of the branches of the candelabrum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31, 33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tongs</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, occurring six times, of which number it is translated five times "tongs," but once "snuffers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>). This latter is the correcter translation, perhaps. The instrument, at any rate, was to trim the lamp-wicks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-22 The furniture of the temple. - Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.</body></html>
