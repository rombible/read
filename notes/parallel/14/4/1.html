This in worthier material superseded the temporary altar of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1, 2</a>), made of shittim wood, and its dimensions five cubits long and broad and three cubits high. Large as was the present altar of brass as compared with the altar that preceded, it fell far short of the requirements of the grand day of dedication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-64.htm">1 Kings 8:64</a>). No statement of the making of this altar occurs in the parallel. The place of it would be between vers. 22 and 23 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. But that Solomon made it is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>, and other references to its presence are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22, 54, 64</a>, etc. The position given to the altar is referred to alike in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-12.htm">2 Chronicles 6:12, 13</a>, as in the court of the temple. It may be well to note that the altar, <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, comes first, and is first spoken of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-22 The furniture of the temple. - Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.</body></html>
