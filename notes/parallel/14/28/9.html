Oded</span>. We do not know any particulars of this prophet; for his name and its possible identity with the name Iddo, see notes on 2 Chronicles 9:29; 15:1, 8. The growingly frequent references to the interposition of the prophets is much to be noticed, and their dignity, courage, fidelity, are brought into grand relief. They are very typical of the moral presence of which no national history, a.s centuries solemnly flow on, gives the slightest symptom of a slackening need. The very same may be said alike of the truth and those qualified and commissioned to bear it, of the message and the messenger. <span class="cmt_word">Before the host</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in very face of the host, somewhat too mildly rendered "to meet" the host, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">In a rage that reacheth up unto heaven</span>. To the wonderful life of this figure, that must strike every reader, must be added the force that comes of its moral rather than merely material suggestion - a moral suggestion that reminds us of that of the sentence of far greater antiquity, and from the sacred lip of the Inspirer of all prophets, "The voice of thy brother's blood <span class="accented">crieth unto me</span> from the ground." The rage had not been that on which the sun did <span class="accented">not</span> go down; it had been so fierce that upon it the sun ought never to have been required to look. See for interesting particulars and then more general references, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>. The expression of the text, however, "reach-eth," or "toucheth," cannot be understood to reproduce as a perfect equivalent the older above-quoted one of "crieth." In other words, the magnitude of the rage is the first thing set forth, and the particular language in which it is set forth well postulates the inference of its abominableness in God's sight. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-27 The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah. - Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and made them the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.</body></html>
