And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.">2Chronicles 28:5-9</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2Kings 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.">Isaiah 7:1</a>.)<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Wherefore</span> (and) <span class= "bld">the Lord his God delivered him.</span>--These opening words help us to understand the ground of the variations of the present account from that of 2 Kings 16. The chronicler purposes, not so much to describe a campaign, as to select those events of it which most conspicuously illustrate God's chastisements of the apostate Ahaz. Accordingly, throughout the description, the historical is subordinated to the didactic motive. (Comp. the account of the Syrian invasion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/24-23.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.">2Chronicles 24:23-24</a>.) Not history for its own sake, but history teaching by example, is what the writer desires to present. At the same time, the events here recorded are above critical suspicion. Thenius characterises the whole section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="Why the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.">2Chronicles 28:5-15</a>) as "thoroughly historical."<p><span class= "bld">Into the hand of the king of Syria.</span>--Rezin of Damascus. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2Kings 16:5</a>.) Instead of relating the joint attempt against Jerusalem, and the seizure of Elath by Rezin, the chronicler prefers to record two severe defeats suffered by Ahaz in the open field, before his retreat behind the walls of Jerusalem. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-17.htm" title="And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.">2Chronicles 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.">2Chronicles 22:1</a>.) After these successes the confederates converged upon the capital, and the panic inspired by the news of their coming is finely depicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm" title="And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.">Isaiah 7:2</a>.

"At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews out of Elath: and the Arameans (<span class= "ital">or</span> Edomites) came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm" title="At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelled there to this day.">2Kings 16:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The <span class="cmt_word">King of Syria</span>. The <span class="accented">name</span> of this king (Rezin) does not appear in this chapter, but it does in the parallel, vers. 5,6, 9. <span class="cmt_word">They smote him</span>. A previous unsuccessful attempt of Rezin and Pekah is apparently passed over in our chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>), while the contents of our present yeas must be understood to have its place just before the last clause of ver. 5 in the parallel, and to be significantly confirmed by the contents of its following verse. <span class="cmt_word">They smote... carried away... brought</span>. These <span class="accented">plurals</span> strongly <span class="accented">indicate the</span> dialocation of sentences in compiled matter. They probably came from original sources, where the conjoined names of Rezin and Pekah had been the antecedents (see on this history, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7, 8, 9</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Brought them to Damascus</span>. The mode of the first introduction of the name of Ahaz in connection with Damascus in the parallel (ver. 10) is a suggestive illustration of how these parallel but very various narratives proffer to piece themselves, and in <span class="cmt_word">a</span> wonderful manner clear their, whole subject of any possible taint of the "cunningly devised fable." <span class="cmt_word">A great multitude</span> of Judah's people had been <span class="cmt_word">carried captives</span> and "brought to Damascus." When the King of Assyria (parallel, ver. 9) came to the help of Ahaz, he struck a fierce and evidently decisive blow against Damascus and Rezin, and to Damascus," to meat" Assyria's king, Tiglath-Pileser, the very next verso tells us, Ahaz. went - little doubt to pay his bills, over which a decent veil of silence is thrown. <span class="cmt_word">He was also delivered into the hand</span>, etc. The form of this sentence, with its "also," and with its evidently tacked-on appearance, coupled with the conjunction "for" with which the following verso is dragged in, seems to give great probability to the idea, <span class="accented">first</span>, that the latter half of ver. 5 and all of ver. 6 find their real place before (say) the word "Damascus;" and secondly, that they are strictly and conterminously paralleled by the former part of ver. 5 parallel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-27 The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah. - Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and made them the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.</body></html>
