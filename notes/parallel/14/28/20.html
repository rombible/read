According to the As syrian Eponym Canon, Tiglath-pileser II. came to the throne B.C. 745, and marched westward against Damascus and Israel, B.C. 734. The importance of these dates for the chronology of the period is obvious.<p><span class= "bld">Came unto him.</span>--Comp. the more detailed narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2Kings 16:7-10</a>; and see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-16.htm" title="At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him.">2Chronicles 28:16</a>. Tiglath was induced by the message and present of Ahaz to undertake a campaign in the west; he captured Damascus, slew Rezin, and transported the population of the city to Kir (Kings, <span class= "ital">l.c.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> After this, "king Ahaz went to Damascus <span class= "ital">to meet</span> Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>). The chronicler in the words before us, is estimating the results of this expedition as they affected the interests of Judah. At the prayer of Ahaz the Assyrian had indeed "come to him"; but not with any purpose of strengthening the southern kingdom. Glad of a pretext for interference in the affairs of the west, the ambitious usurper was simply bent on the extension of his own empire; and when the more powerful states of Syria and Israel lay at his feet, he naturally proceeded to require a most unequivocal acknowledgment of vassalage from Ahaz. He thus "distressed" or oppressed him by reducing his kingdom to a mere dependency of Assyria, besides impoverishing him of all his treasure, which Ahaz had sent as the price of this ruinous help.<p><span class= "bld">Distressed him, but strengthened him not.</span>--This is correct. A possible rendering is: "and besieged him, and conquered him not"; but the context is against it. (The word <span class= "ital">chazaq,</span> "strengthened," everywhere else means <span class= "ital">to be strong,</span> or, <span class= "ital">to prevail.</span> LXX. omits the last words, rendering the whole <span class= "greekheb">??? ???????? ?????</span><span class= "ital">.</span> Syriac and Arabic, "besieged him." The Vulg. has: "et afflixit eum, et nullo resistente vastavit." That Judah now became tributary to Assyria is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-7.htm" title="And the LORD was with him; and he prospered wherever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.">2Kings 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.">2Kings 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-20.htm" title="You say, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?">2Kings 18:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tilgath-Pilneser</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-6.htm">1 Chronicles 5:6, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a>, our parallel. See our notes in full on 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26). Gesenius dates his reign as King of Assyria as <span class="date">B.C. 753-734</span>; others as about <span class="date">B.C. 747-728</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Distressed him, but strengthened him not</span>. This is in our writer's usual deeper moral and religious vein, and was no doubt most true. For all Ahaz paid and bribed out of the sacrilegiously employed treasure of the temple, out of the depreciating and partial dismantling of "the house of the king," and out of the begged contributions or taxes extortionately wrung "of the princes" (see the succinct account of next verse, and compare the parallel in its vers. 8, 18), he bought a master for himself, servitude, tributariness, and the humiliation of disgrace itself. The temporary relief he obtained (and which the writer of Chronicles in no way means to deny) from one enemy rivetted round his neck the yoke of another and greater. And worse than this, he secured in his own heart the greatest adversary of all - a restless, implacable foe, which ever goaded him on to worse folly and deeper sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-27 The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah. - Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and made them the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.</body></html>
