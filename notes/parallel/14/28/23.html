(Not "at Damascus," as Thenius renders.)<p><span class= "bld">Which smote him.</span>--Did the chronicler himself believe that the gods of Aram had any power or real existence? That such was the common belief of the Israelites in the days of Ahaz appears certain. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm" title="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.">Judges 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1Samuel 26:19</a>.) In the latter half of Isaiah we find the nothingness of the false gods strongly asserted; but there was also another current opinion, which St. Paul repeats, and which Milton has adopted in <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>viz., that "the things which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to <span class= "ital">demons</span>" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1Corinthians 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Because the gods.</span>--Omit <span class= "ital">because </span>(the Hebrew particle simply introduces what the speaker said). "The gods of the kings of Aram, <span class= "ital">they </span>help them; <span class= "ital">to them </span>will I sacrifice, that they may help me." Such is the word ascribed to Ahaz, implying a doubt of Jehovah's power or willingness to help. (<span class= "ital">Ma'z?rim, "</span>help," an Aramaised form.)<p><span class= "bld">But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and they </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> those very gods) <span class= "ital">were to him to make him stumble, and all Israel. </span>The mode of expression, as well as the thought expressed, is highly characteristic.<p><span class= "bld">Israel </span>= Judah, as usual.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him</span>. The writer must be understood to speak from the point of view of Ahaz, in putting it, that it was the gods of Damascus who smote." The formula, all Israel, is a clear instance of how the name "Israel" is used as "Judah." The <span class="accented">gods of Damascus</span> were, of course, the same with those of Syria, of which Damascus was capital. Their names were Rimmon, Tabrim-men, Hadad, and some others. Perhaps no verse in Chronicles is more typical of the special moral aspects and aims of the writer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-27 The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah. - Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and made them the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.</body></html>
