This is</span> the probable, yet hardly certain, meaning of the clause. <span class="accented">My name</span> should be "by names." And the meaning may be that "the men who were <span class="accented">now</span> specified by names for the work rose up," etc. Under any aspect, it was likely enough these would embrace the four who had already spoken so piously and seasonably (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-19.htm">2 Chronicles 31:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-31.htm">1 Chronicles 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-41.htm">1 Chronicles 16:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The captives</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the captivity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of course, the body of captives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clothed... arrayed.</span> These two renderings are both the same verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>), and even the same (hiph.) conjugation. The undisguised, apparent repetition in the Hebrew text, veiled and disguised in both the Authorized and Revised Versions, may perhaps be owing to the intentness of the narrative on saying, <span class="accented">first</span>, that all <span class="accented">who were literally naked</span> were clothed from their own captive spoil; and then, <span class="accented">secondly</span>, that <span class="accented">all</span> whosoever (dusty, dirty, tired, footsore) were clothed, in the sense of being fresh dressed. The eleven particulars of this verso are uncommonly graphic in the Hebrew text brevity of description. The verse may read thus: <span class="accented">And the men appointed by their names rose up, and took the captives by the hand, and all of the naked of them they dressed from the very spoil, and dressed them</span> (<span class="accented">all</span>)<span class="accented">, and shod them, and fed them, and gave them drink, and anointed them, and carried upon asses all the feeble ones, and brought them to Jericho, city of palms, to the very side of their brethren, and</span>... <span class="accented">returned to Samaria.</span> These made their own so far the blessedness of them of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34-36</a>. Jericho; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> well within their own land, to a fertile and shaded spot of it, with plenty of water, and whence probably all might most easily wend their ways to their own district and town, <span class="accented">Jericho</span> lay on the border of Benjamin. See Stanley's most interesting account ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 805). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-27 The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah. - Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and made them the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.</body></html>
