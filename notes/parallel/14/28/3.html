In later times, the term "valley of Hinnom," spelt as one word, and with modified vowels, <span class= "ital">G?hinn?m,</span> became the appellation of hell, "the house of woe and pain." It is so used in the Targums, and later in the Talmud, and appears in the New Testament under the Graecised form <span class= "greekheb">??????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> whence the Latin Gehenna.<p><span class= "bld">Burnt his children in the fire.</span>--Kings, "And even his own son <span class= "ital">he made to pass through the fire."</span> The chronicler has paraphrased by transposing two Hebrew letters (<span class= "ital">ba</span>'<span class= "ital">ar</span> for <span class= "ital">'abar</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> "His children is simply a generalised expression, as we might say, "he burnt his own <span class= "ital">offspring</span> or posterity."

Thenius accuses the chronicler of exaggerating the fact. But this peculiar use of the plural is one of the marks of his style.

He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.</body></html>
