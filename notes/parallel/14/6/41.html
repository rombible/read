you, and the ark of your strength.">Psalm 132:8-10</a>. It would seem that the chronicler selected them as forming a more natural and appropriate conclusion to the Prayer of Dedication than that which he found in the older account. The aptness of the quotation may be admitted, without assuming that "for want of this summons to take possession of the sanctuary, the point of the whole prayer is wanting in Kings" (<span class= "ital">Z�ckler</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The peroration of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-50.htm" title="And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:">1Kings 8:50-53</a> is quite natural, though different; the closing thoughts being a return to those with which the prayer began, so that the prayer forms a well-rounded whole, and the suggestion of a lacuna is out of place. There is no difficulty in this view; the difficulty lies rather in maintaining the originality of these verses here. (Comp. the free adaptation of several late Psalms in the Hymn of Praise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people.">1Chronicles 16:8</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>) The versification of the original psalm is neglected here, as there.<p>(41) <span class= "bld">Now therefore.</span>--<span class= "ital">And now</span> added by chronicler.<p><span class= "bld">O Lord God.</span>--<span class= "ital">Iahweh '?lohim.</span> This rare divine title occurs thrice in these two verses, but nowhere else in the prayer. The chronicler uses it as least eight times, but it does not appear at all in the books of Kings. In the Psalm we read simply <span class= "ital">Iahweh.</span><p><span class= "bld">Into thy resting place.</span>--<span class= "ital">N-ah.</span> A late word, found besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/esther/9-16.htm" title="But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,">Esther 9:16-18</a> (<span class= "ital">noah</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In the Psalm it is <span class= "ital">m?n-h?h,</span> a common word.<p>The idea that <span class= "ital">the sanctuary</span> is God's resting-place is not in keeping with the spirit of the prayer.

First and chiefly, he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.</body></html>
