What words Solomon used in thus blessing <span class="cmt_word">the whole congregation</span> are not given either here or in the parallel. The impression one takes is that the blessing was, in fact, wrapt up tacitly in all that Solomon recounts, when he said, <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel</span>, etc. (ver. 4). However, it is not impossible that, with the variation of the tense in ver. 59, the verses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55 - 61</a> may contain the substance of it, if not itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-42 Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple. - The order of Solomon's prayer is to be observed. First and chiefly, he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.</body></html>
