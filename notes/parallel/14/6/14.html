Syriac, "Thou art the Lord that sittest in heaven above, and Thy will (pl.) is done on earth beneath;" apparently a curious reminiscence of the Lord's Prayer. The Assyrians also spoke of their gods as "without an equal" (<span class= "ital">sanina la is-,</span> "a rival he has not").<p><span class= "bld">Which keepest covenant and shewest mercy.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">keeping the covenant and the mercy; i.e.,</span> the covenanted mercy.

(The verse is word for word as in Kings.)<p><span class= "bld">And spakest with thy mouth. . . .</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-4.htm" title="And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,">2Chronicles 6:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No God like thee</span>, etc. The quoting of Scripture and the utilizing of language in which the religious feeling of those who have gone before has expressed itself had plainly set in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). The prayer which this verso opens occupies twenty-eight verses; it is the longest prayer recorded in Scripture. It consists of two verses (14, 15) of opening; then follow three petitions - first, that God would perpetuate the line of David (ver. 16); <span class="accented">next</span>, that he would have regard to the place where his Name is put (vers. 17-20); and <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, that he would hear the prayers addressed to him toward this place (ver. 21). Of this last subject, seven different cases are propounded <span class="accented">- firstly</span>, the case of the man wronged by his neighbour (vers. 22, 23); <span class="accented">secondly</span>, of the people worsted by their enemies (vers. 24, 25); <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, of the people suffering from drought (vers. 26, 27); <span class="accented">fourthly</span>, of the people visited by death or special calamity (vers. 28-31); <span class="accented">fifthly</span>, of the stranger who comes to offer to pray (vers 32, 33); <span class="accented">sixthly</span>, of the people going to war by God's permission (vers. 34, 35); <span class="accented">seventhly</span>, of the people in captivity (vers. 36-39). Then the prayer closes in vers. 40-42. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-42 Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple. - The order of Solomon's prayer is to be observed. First and chiefly, he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.</body></html>
