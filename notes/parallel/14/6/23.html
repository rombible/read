The chronicler has substituted a more ordinary expression, which, indeed, is found in all the versions of Kings. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-25.htm" title="Then hear you from the heavens, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.">2Chronicles 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-30.htm" title="Then hear you from heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you only know the hearts of the children of men:)">2Chronicles 6:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for; that all people of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.">2Chronicles 6:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-35.htm" title="Then hear you from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.">2Chronicles 6:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-39.htm" title="Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people which have sinned against you.">2Chronicles 6:39</a>.<p><span class= "bld">By requiting the wicked.</span>--<span class= "ital">So as to requite a wicked man.</span> Kings, "so as to find guilty<span class= "ital">"</span> (also the Syriac here).

First and chiefly, he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.</body></html>
