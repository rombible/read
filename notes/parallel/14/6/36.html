The prayer is remarkable all the more as the last of the whole series, and one so sadly ominous! The <span class="accented">last</span> clause of ver. 36, carrying the expression <span class="cmt_word">far off</span>, as the alternative of near, throws its lurid glare of unwelcome suggestion on all the rest. <span class="cmt_word">No</span> <span class="cmt_word">man which sinneth not</span>. The words need the summoning of no biblical parallels, for these are so numerous. But out of the rest emphasis may be placed at least on those furnished by Solomon himself - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:21</a>; both of which are particularly sententious. <span class="cmt_word">Bethink themselves</span>. The words well express, in English idiom, the literal Hebrew, as in margin, "bring back to their heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-11</a><span class="cmt_word">). Have sinned, ... done amiss,... dealt wickedly</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>). The Authorized Version in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>) is somewhat happier in its rendering of the three verbs employed here. It seems doubtful whether these have it in them to form a climax; more probably they speak of three different <span class="accented">directions</span> in wrong going. The parallel is well worthy of being referred to, in its vers. 50, 51. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-42 Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple. - The order of Solomon's prayer is to be observed. First and chiefly, he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.</body></html>
