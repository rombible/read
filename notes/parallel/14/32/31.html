(See the account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm" title="At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.">2Kings 20:12</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.;</span> Isaiah 39)<p><span class= "bld">Who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder</span> (Hebrew, <span class= "ital">the sign,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-24.htm" title="In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed to the LORD: and he spoke to him, and he gave him a sign.">2Chronicles 32:24</a>).--This is not mentioned in the parallel passage of Kings and Isaiah. But such an inquiry is quite in harmony with what we know of the Babylonians from their own monuments. Babylon was the home of the arts of divination and augury, from observation of all kinds of signs and portents in every department of nature. Moreover, the sign given to Hezekiah would have a special interest for the astrologers and astronomers of the Babylonian temple-towers.<p><span class= "bld">God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</span>--"To try," the same word as "to tempt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-12.htm" title="But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.">Isaiah 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-9.htm" title="When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.">Psalm 95:9</a>; and often).<p><span class= "bld">That he might know</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in order to bring out and make manifest the latent possibilities of Hezekiah's character. The Searcher of hearts knew the issue beforehand; but we can only conceive of His dealings with man by means of human analogies, such as that of the chemist, who subjects an imperfectly known substance to various combinations of circumstances, by way of ascertaining its nature and affinities. The remark is peculiar to the chronicler.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and thus.</span> The italic type dispensed with, the verse may be rendered, <span class="cmt_word">And thus with or among the ambassadors of the princes...

The word may betray the inquiries and curiosity of the princes of Babylon, under the king, the expression of which led to the embassy, so to call it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:24-33 God left Hezekiah to himself, that, by this trial and his weakness in it, what was in his heart might be known; that he was not so perfect in grace as he thought he was. It is good for us to know ourselves, and our own weakness and sinfulness, that we may not be conceited, or self-confident, but may always live in dependence upon Divine grace. We know not the corruption of our own hearts, nor what we shall do if God leaves us to ourselves. His sin was, that his heart was lifted up. What need have great men, and good men, and useful men, to study their own infirmities and follies, and their obligations to free grace, that they may never think highly of themselves; but beg earnestly of God, that he will always keep them humble! Hezekiah made a bad return to God for his favours, by making even those favours the food and fuel of his pride. Let us shun the occasions of sin: let us avoid the company, the amusements, the books, yea, the very sights that may administer to sin. Let us commit ourselves continually to God's care and protection; and beg of him never to leave us nor forsake us. Blessed be God, death will soon end the believer's conflict; then pride and every sin will be abolished. He will no more be tempted to withhold the praise which belongs to the God of his salvation.</body></html>
