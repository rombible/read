The great inscription of Sennacherib says nothing about the siege of Lachish; but a bas-relief, now in the British Museum, represents him seated on his throne receiving a file of captives who issue from the gate of a city. Over the king's head is written "Sennacherib, the king of multitudes, the king of the land of Asshur, on a raised throne sate, and caused the spoils of the city of Lachish (<span class= "ital">Lakisu</span>) to pass before him."<p><span class= "bld">His power.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">his dominion</span> or <span class= "ital">realm.</span> Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,">Jeremiah 34:1</a>, "all the kingdoms of the lands of the dominion of his hand."

On the other side, there is very little additional in our narrative, a few words heightening the effect in our vers. 18, 20, 21, constituting the whole of such additional matter. The vague mark of time, <span class="cmt_word">after this</span>, with which our present verse opens, merely says that in due course of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah, and attack of the fenced cities (ver. 1), he proceeds to send his servants and his insolent defiances to the metropolis, Jerusalem itself. The three words in italics, "himself <span class="accented">laid</span> "siege," should evidently give place to the single word "remained" or "was;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he and all his host with him remained at, or opposite to, Lachish, while his servants went to defy Jerusalem in his name. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-23 Those who trust God with their safety, must use proper means, else they tempt him.

Let the good subjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ, rest upon his word, and boldly say, Since God is for us, who can be against us? By the favour of God, enemies are lost, and friends gained.</body></html>
