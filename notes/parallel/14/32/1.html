( Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2Kings 18:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.">2Kings 19:37</a>. ) The Assyrian monarch's own record of the campaign may be read on his great hexagonal prism of terra-cotta, preserved in the British Museum, containing an inscription in 487 lines of cuneiform writing, which is lithographed in the <span class= "ital">Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia,</span> III. 38, 39, and printed in G.

For the date, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2Kings 18:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Sennacherib.</span>--So the Vulg. The LXX. gives <span class= "greekheb">??????????</span> or <span class= "greekheb">???</span>; Herodotus, <span class= "greekheb">???????????</span>; Josephus, <span class= "greekheb">????????????</span>. The Hebrew is S<span class= "ital">anch?rib.</span> The real name as given by the Assyrian monuments is <span class= "ital">Sin-ahi-iriba,</span> or <span class= "ital">erba</span> ("Sin," i.e.,the moon-god,"multiplied brothers").<p><span class= "bld">And thought to win them for himself.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and said to himself that he would break them open</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm" title="And they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.">2Chronicles 21:17</a>), or <span class= "ital">and commanded to break them open for himself.</span> Kings states that he fulfilled his purpose; he "came up against all the fenced cities of Judah, <span class= "ital">and took them."</span> Sennacherib himself boasts as follows: "And Hazakiyahu of the country of the Jews who had not submitted to my yoke, forty-six strong cities of his, fortresses, and the small cities of their neighbourhood, which were without number . . . I approached, I took." The chronicler's object is to relate the mighty deliverance of Hezekiah. Hence he omits such details as would weaken the impression he desires to produce. For the same reason nothing is said here of Hezekiah's submission and payment of tribute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.">2Kings 18:14-16</a>); and perhaps for the further reason (as suggested by Keil) that "these negotiations had no influence on the after-course and issue of the war," but <span class= "ital">not</span> because (as Thenius alleges) the chronicler was unwilling to mention Hezekiah's (forced) sacrilege. They are omitted also in Isaiah, where the account is in other respects abridged as compared with Kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The establishment thereof;</span> translate, and this (his) <span class="accented">truth</span>.

This verse and these items of it may without any inconvenient strain be made conterminous with just one verse in Kings, the thirteenth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a>. The king personally seems to have devoted himself especially to the siege of Lachish, an Amoritish city indeed originally, and a place of great strength of petition, but conquered by Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26, 31-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span> here and in parallel).

Let the good subjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ, rest upon his word, and boldly say, Since God is for us, who can be against us? By the favour of God, enemies are lost, and friends gained.</body></html>
