Jerusalem</span>. Whether the three verses of ill omen already alluded to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>) may be road precedent to this verse, and purport that the bribes had <span class="accented">been paid</span>, and yet had failed of their object, so that Hezekiah was now compelled to brace himself to the occasion, and "took counsel," etc. (next verse); or whether this verse dates (as some think)the quailing heart of Hezekiah, and an <span class="accented">offer</span> or <span class="accented">part</span> payment of treasure by Hezekiah to Sennacherib, which only increased his insolence, as immediately now related, is uncertain, perhaps. In the face of the emphatic language of the three verses of the parallel, and in consideration of the possible motives as suggested above for our compiler omitting the matter altogether, we incline to the former opinion. That would have the effect of making this verse say that when Hezekiah had his eyes opened to the failure of his bribe - a waste payment, for that Sennacherib still "purposed to fight against Jerusalem" - he finally proceeded to take the right steps. However, the witness and indications of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2-4</a>, may go some way to shield Hezekiah from the entire blame. The silence of our compiler on the whole matter is the one residuum of fact, and unfortunate in its suggestion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-23 Those who trust God with their safety, must use proper means, else they tempt him. God will provide, but so must we also. Hezekiah gathered his people together, and spake comfortably to them. A believing confidence in God, will raise us above the prevailing fear of man. Let the good subjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ, rest upon his word, and boldly say, Since God is for us, who can be against us? By the favour of God, enemies are lost, and friends gained.</body></html>
