These fountains or springs were probably those represented by <span class="accented">En Rogel</span>, on the <span class="accented">Ophel spur</span> or very large mound, or fortified hill (mistranslated possibly from that circumstance "tower," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-24.htm">2 Kings 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), on the southeast of the temple. The object of Hezekiah is obvious enough. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>) for "stopping" occurs in all thirteen times - twice in piel in Genesis, once in niph. in Nehemiah, and ten times in kal in Kings, Chronicles, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms. It is for all material purposes very uniformly rendered in all these places by the word "stop" eight times, and otherwise "shut" or "closed," or to carry a derived meaning, "hidden" or "secret." If the word "shut" or "shut off" were employed, it would fit every occasion. So we are not told here how he stopped the fountain or fountains, but that he shut the waters off from one direction and guided them into another, vie. by a conduit running <span class="accented">westward</span> from the springs and the Gihon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the brook) flowing naturally down the Tyropoean valley to a pool prepared for it in the city (see our ver. 30; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; Ecclus, 48:17; and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 339). This pool was very probably none other than the pool of Siloam. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-23 Those who trust God with their safety, must use proper means, else they tempt him. God will provide, but so must we also. Hezekiah gathered his people together, and spake comfortably to them. A believing confidence in God, will raise us above the prevailing fear of man. Let the good subjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ, rest upon his word, and boldly say, Since God is for us, who can be against us? By the favour of God, enemies are lost, and friends gained.</body></html>
