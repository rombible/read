Stating, on the other hand, in mere historic dry detail, the return of Sennacherib to his own land, his dwelling at Nineveh, and assassination, in the house of Nisroch "his god," at the hands of his own two sons, mentioned by name Adrammelech and Sharezer, who had to fly for it to Armenia (<span class="accented">Ararat</span>), it does not show the obviously designed moral touch of our compiler, <span class="cmt_word">so he returned with shame of face to his own</span> <span class="cmt_word">land,</span> nor the similarly complexioned description of the time, place, and agents of his assassination.

Let the good subjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ, rest upon his word, and boldly say, Since God is for us, who can be against us? By the favour of God, enemies are lost, and friends gained.</body></html>
