Some think (as, for instance, Canon Rawlinson) that they were sin offering, as the account of the offering of them (ver. 22) takes priority for them over the he-goats; others (as Bertheau, Professor J. G. Murphy, etc.), that they were certainly burnt offering. It scarcely appears as though much stress can be laid upon what is apparently the chief reason of Canon Rawlinson's opinion, in face of the immediate language of the last sentence of our ver. 24, "for the king commended the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel." The fact of no mention of burnt offering in our present verse, and of the natural construction of the description, "for a sin offering for the kingdom," etc., as applying to <span class="accented">all</span> that had preceded, seems the better argument, and all that is necessary, unless something moderately decisive be forthcoming to rebut it. The solution of all, however, is probably to our hand in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, which is a very close and significant parallel to our present verse. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, or "young bullocks" is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, etc.; Leviticus 8:2, 14, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>; and, after, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-18, 19-21</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2, 22</a>, etc. The first mention of the sacrifices of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-7</a>, and, after, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is the present passage; and, after, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-25.htm">Ezra 8:25</a>. But the mention of sacrifices of goats is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-12.htm">Leviticus 3:12</a>, and often besides. <span class="cmt_word">For the kingdom</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably for "all that are in authority," viz. the king and rulers, the Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) designating here those exercising dominion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-8.htm">1 Kings 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-17.htm">1 Samuel 28:17</a>) rather than the country under dominion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5</a>). It is, however, possible that allusion to the whole kingdom of Judah and Israel is made here. For the sanctuary; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who officiated in holy things. For Judah; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for all the people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:20-36 As soon as Hezekiah heard that the temple was ready, he lost no time. Atonement must be made for the sins of the last reign. It was not enough to lament and forsake those sins; they brought a sin-offering. Our repentance and reformation will not obtain pardon but in and through Christ, who was made sin, that is, a sin-offering for us. While the offerings were on the altar, the Levites sang. Sorrow for sin must not prevent us from praising God. The king and the congregation gave their consent to all that was done. It is not enough for us to be where God is worshipped, if we do not ourselves worship with the heart. And we should offer up our spiritual sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, and devote ourselves and all we have, as sacrifices, acceptable to the Father only through the Redeemer.</body></html>
