And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.">2Chronicles 29:21</a>, because all that comes between is descriptive of the preparations made for the due performance of the sacrifice. When the victims had been slain, flayed, and cut up, and the altar had been sprinkled with their blood, and when the Levitical musicians had taken their places, instruments in hand, everything was ready, and the sacrifice was ordered to begin. "And at the time when the burnt offering began, the song of Jehovah" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the chant of the Levites with its musical accompaniment) "began, and the clarions; and that under the lead of the instruments of David king of Israel," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the harps and lyres were dominant throughout, and the clarions subordinate to their music. Or we may render: "And that at the side of (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> along with) the instruments of David king of Israel." The phrase is <span class= "ital">'al-y?de,</span> "upon the hands." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/25-2.htm" title="Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.">1Chronicles 25:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-6.htm" title="All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.">1Chronicles 25:6</a>.) The LXX. omits the needless "and that" (<span class= "ital">w?</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> the Syriac renders: "And when the burnt offerings began to be offered, Hezekiah began to chant the praises of the Lord, as from the mouth of David king of Israel."

This verse and the following, with graphic brevity, purport to describe the actual consummating of the preparations rehearsed before, and, as seems most probable, in the significance of the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, already referred to. The whole of the burnt offering was burnt on the altar, but of the sin offering the "fat" alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-19.htm">Leviticus 4:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:20-36 As soon as Hezekiah heard that the temple was ready, he lost no time. Atonement must be made for the sins of the last reign. It was not enough to lament and forsake those sins; they brought a sin-offering. Our repentance and reformation will not obtain pardon but in and through Christ, who was made sin, that is, a sin-offering for us. While the offerings were on the altar, the Levites sang. Sorrow for sin must not prevent us from praising God. The king and the congregation gave their consent to all that was done. It is not enough for us to be where God is worshipped, if we do not ourselves worship with the heart. And we should offer up our spiritual sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, and devote ourselves and all we have, as sacrifices, acceptable to the Father only through the Redeemer.</body></html>
