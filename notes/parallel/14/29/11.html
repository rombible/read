This verb in kal (supposing it the same verb) occurs but five times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-26.htm">Job 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-6.htm">Psalm 122:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-5.htm">Lamentations 1:5</a>), the radical idea of it being the safety of ease or security rather than any absolute safety. In niph. it is found only in this place and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-28.htm">2 Kings 4:28</a>, where the rendering of the Authorized Version, "Do not <span class="accented">deceive</span> me," will easily yield the same essential idea. The derivative adjective (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;</span>) occurs eight times, and always has the same flavour about it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-40.htm">1 Chronicles 4:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-12.htm">Job 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-20.htm">Job 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>). And the derivative nouns (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) occur nine times, and, at any rate, in <span class="accented">almost</span> every instance evidently carrying the same fundamental idea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21, 24</a>). Our Authorized Version, therefore, sufficiently reproduces the thought of Hezekiah, though perhaps this would more exactly come out of the rendering, "Be not now at ease," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sacrifice ease and self-indulgence, etc. <span class="cmt_word">To serve him... that ye should minister</span>. The same verb is used in both these places; so Revised Version, To <span class="accented">minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-19 When Hezekiah came to the crown, he applied at once to work reform. Those who begin with God, begin at the right end of their work, and it will prosper accordingly. Those that turn their backs upon God's ordinances, may truly be said to forsake God himself. There are still such neglects, if the word be not duly read and opened, for that was signified by the lighting the lamps, and also if prayers and praise be not offered up, for that was signified by the burning incense. Neglect of God's worship was the cause of the calamities they had lain under. The Lord alone can prepare the heart of man for vital godliness: when much good is done in a little time, the glory must be ascribed to him; and all who love him or the souls of men, will rejoice therein. Let those that do good work, learn to do it well.</body></html>
