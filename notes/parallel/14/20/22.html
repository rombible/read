This statement anticipates what follows. The ancient translators felt a difficulty here, as is evident from their versions. Thus the LXX. has, "The Lord made the sons of Ammon to war upon Moab and Mount Seir, who came out against Judah; and they were routed." The Vulg., "The Lord turned their ambushment against themselves, viz., that of the sons of Amnion and Moab and Mount Seir, who had gone forth to fight against Judah, and they were smitten."<p>The Syriac (and Arabic) travesty <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-21.htm" title="And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endures for ever.">2Chronicles 20:21</a> and the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm" title="And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.">2Chronicles 20:22</a> thus: "And he stood in the middle of the people, and said, Come, let us give thanks unto the Lord, and let us laud the splendour of his holiness, when he goeth out before our hosts, and maketh war for us with our foes: and be saying, Give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, and his goodness endureth for ever. The hills began praising, and the mountains began rejoicing."They then continue as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-24.htm" title="And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked to the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.">2Chronicles 20:24</a>, omitting "The Lord set ambushments . . . they were smitten."<p>The self-destruction of the allied hordes was undoubtedly providential, but it need not have been miraculous. How was it brought about? The answer depends on the meaning of the term "liers in wait." Were <span class= "ital">angels</span> meant, as some have thought (Ewald's <span class= "ital">b�ser Geister</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> a more appropriate and less ambiguous term would have been employed to express their agency. Nor is it likely that a <span class= "ital">Judean</span> ambuscade is thus obscurely mentioned without any further reference or explanation: indeed it is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-15.htm" title="And he said, Listen you, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat, Thus said the LORD to you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.">2Chronicles 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-17.htm" title="You shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.">2Chronicles 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-24.htm" title="And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked to the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.">2Chronicles 20:24</a>, that the part of the Judeans was that of mere spectators of an accomplished fact. Nor, finally, must we suppose that "the waylaying was done by a section of the confederates themselves, probably certain of the Maonites."<p>The truth appears to be that some portion of the unwieldy and straggling host was suddenly attacked by a lurking band of Bedawi freebooters. In the providence of God the partial confusion which thus originated speedily became a universal panic. The Ammonites and Moabites instantly suspected their less civilised allies, the Maonites, of treachery, and fell upon them in a frenzy of revenge; after which, maddened by slaughter and mutual suspicion, and the memory of ancient feuds, they turned their reeking swords against each other, and the strife only ended with the self-annihilation of the allies. The occurrence is thus to some extent parallel with the self-destruction of the Midianite hordes, when thrown into confusion by the stratagem of Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm" title="And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.">Judges 7:22</a>).<p>The marvellous result, marvellously predicted, was brought to pass by a perfectly natural sequence of events, just as was Elisha's prophecy of plenty to famine-stricken Samaria, though at the time when it was uttered fulfilment seemed impossible, unless the Lord were to "make windows in heaven," and pour down supplies from thence by a visible miracle. In neither case was the course of events foreseen by the prophet, but only their issue. (See 2 Kings 7)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set ambushments</span>. The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "set persons lying in wait," or "in ambush" (piel part. plur. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>). So <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-25.htm">Judges 9:25</a>, but kal participle with apparently future equivalent meaning occurs eighteen times in Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Ezra, Jeremiah, and Lamentations. Who the persons were, supernatural or not, or what their mode of operation, is not told, and is not plain. The effects are quite plain - that <span class="accented">first</span> the two confederates, Moab and Ammon, thought they saw reason to fall on them "of Mount Seir," and <span class="accented">secondly</span>, having this done, to fall on one another to the end of mutual extermination. <span class="cmt_word">They were smitten</span>. The marginal, "they smote one another," may be better, but it is not at all necessary, the meaning being that collectively they became the smitten instead of the smiters! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:20-30 Jehoshaphat exhorted his troops to firm faith in God. Faith inspires a man with true courage; nor will any thing help more to the establishing of the heart in shaking times, than a firm belief of the power, and mercy, and promise of God. In all our trust in the Lord, and our praises of him, let us especially look at his everlasting mercy to sinners through Jesus Christ. Never was an army so destroyed as that of the enemy. Thus God often makes wicked people destroy one another. And never was a victory celebrated with more solemn thanksgivings.</body></html>
