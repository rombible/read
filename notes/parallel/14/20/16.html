It is replaced in the Septuagint by both <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Stanley, in an interesting note on the word ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 500, edit. 1866), says it is applied to several localities in Palestine, viz.: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The "Ascent of Akrabbim," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">scorpions</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a>), on the south border of Judah and probably the same as the Pass of Safeh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The going up to (or <span class="accented">of</span>) Adummim<span class="accented"></span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "ascent of the Red<span class="accented"></span>," near Gilgal, on border of Judah and Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>), probably the same with the "Pass of Jericho." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The" going up to Gut" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Our present text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The "mounting up of Luhith" in Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a>). The word is also applied to the steep pass from Gibeon to Beth-heron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>; 1 Macc. 3:16); to the road up the Mount of Olives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>); and to the approach to the city in which Samuel anointed Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-11.htm">1 Samuel 9:11</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the hill up to the city." The passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13</a>, Authorized Version "before the sun was up," Revised Version "from the ascent of Heres," possibly designates <span class="accented">a rising ground</span>, named . 'the Ascent of the Sun<span class="accented"></span>," or, "of Heres." The following extract from Keil, with its quotations from Robinson, is interesting. "The wilderness Jezreel was without doubt the name of a part of the great stretch of fiat country bounded on the south by the Waddy El Ghar, and extending from the Dead Sea to the neighbourhood of Tekoa, which is now called <span class="accented">El</span> <span class="accented">Hassasah</span>, after a waddy on its northern side. The whole country on the west side of the Dead Sea," where it does not consist of mountain ridges or deep valleys, is high table-land sloping gradually towards the east, wholly waste, merely covered here and there by a few bushes and without the slightest trace of having ever been cultivated' (Robinson's 'Palest.,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>). Our present ascent of Ziz, or Hazziz, has perhaps remained in the Waddy El Hassasah Robinson takes it to be the pass, which at present leads from Ain-jiddy to the table-land. Yet it is described by him as a 'fearful pass,' and it can hardly be thought of here even if the enemy like the Bedouins, now when on their forays, may be supposed to have marched along the shore of the sea, and ascended to the tableland only at Engedi; for the Israelites did not meet the enemy in this ascent, but <span class="accented">above</span> upon the table-land." Josephus translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, but with no legitimate justification. <span class="cmt_word">The end of the brook</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rather the end of the brook-way, or course of the brook when there was water to make one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:14-19 The Spirit of prophecy came upon a Levite in the midst of the congregation. The Spirit, like the wind, blows where and on whom He listeth. He encouraged them to trust in God. Let the Christian soldier go out against his spiritual enemies, and the God of peace will make him more than a conqueror. Our trials will prove our gain. The advantage will be all our own, but the whole glory must be given to God.</body></html>
