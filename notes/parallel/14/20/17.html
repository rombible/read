but for as much as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.">1Chronicles 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-2.htm" title="Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever.">1Chronicles 15:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In this.</span>--<span class= "ital">Herein, in this instance.</span> (Comp. for the phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath on you from before the LORD.">2Chronicles 19:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Set yourselves</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "withstand," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-6.htm" title="And said, O LORD God of our fathers, are not you God in heaven? and rule not you over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in your hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand you?">2Chronicles 20:6</a>).--<span class= "ital">Station yourselves, take your stand.</span> Here the next verb, <span class= "ital">stand ye still,</span> seems added as an explanation, and is, perhaps, a marginal gloss. "Fear not: take your stand, and see the salvation of the Lord," was the command of Moses to Israel at the Red Sea, just before the Great Deliverance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm" title="And Moses said to the people, Fear you not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom you have seen to day, you shall see them again no more for ever.">Exodus 14:13</a>). (Comp. also the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-8.htm" title="Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he has made in the earth.">Psalm 46:8</a>, "Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.")<p><span class= "bld">The Lord with you.</span>--Some explain the connection thus: "The Lord (who is) with you." <span class= "ital">Iahveh 'immdkhem</span> may, perhaps, be compared with <span class= "ital">'imm?n- el, "</span>with us God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm" title="And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.">Isaiah 8:8</a>); it will then be a Divine title, suited to the present emergency. But, more probably, the stop should be at <span class= "ital">the Lord;</span> and <span class= "ital">with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!</span> is an elliptic expression, meaning "He is, or will be with you," &c, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-6.htm" title="And said to the judges, Take heed what you do: for you judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.">2Chronicles 19:6</a>.

The grand original of these words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>) would be known to both Jahaziel and Jehoshaphat. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:14-19 The Spirit of prophecy came upon a Levite in the midst of the congregation.

Let the Christian soldier go out against his spiritual enemies, and the God of peace will make him more than a conqueror. Our trials will prove our gain. The advantage will be all our own, but the whole glory must be given to God.</body></html>
