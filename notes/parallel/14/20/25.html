(For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)">Judges 8:24-26</a> (the spoils of Midian). The amount of the spoil is explained by the circumstance that the invaders had intended to effect a permanent settlement in Judah, and so brought all their goods with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-11.htm" title="Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.">2Chronicles 20:11</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-12.htm" title="Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.">Psalm 83:12</a>.) The invasion was thus similar in character to the migrations of the barbarian hordes, which broke repeatedly over the declining Roman empire, though of course it was on a much smaller scale. Its repulse, however, has proved not less momentous in the history of mankind, than that of the Persians at Marathon, or of the Saracens at Roncesvalles. The greatness of the overthrow may be inferred from the fact that the prophet Joel makes it a type of the coming judgment of Israel's enemies in the "Valley of Jehoshaphat"--a prophetic designation which alludes at once to the catastrophe recorded here, and to the truth that "Jehovah is judge" of all the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm" title="I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.">Joel 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-12.htm" title="Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.">Joel 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-14.htm" title="Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.">Joel 3:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Both riches with the dead bodies</span>. The Hebrew text reads literally, <span class="accented">both riches and dead bodies</span> (no article). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the text, however, appears in several ("old authorities," Revised Version) manuscripts, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> ("garments"), and the versions of both Septuagint and Vulgate lend their authority to this reading. Jewels. The Hebrew term is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, the most frequent rendering of which is "vessels," so rendered, that is, a hundred and sixty times out of about three hundred and eight times in all of its occurrence. It is, however, a word of very generic quality, and is rendered as here "jewels" about twenty-five other times. It would seem nugatory to tell us that there were "dead bodies," in the bald rendering of "and dead bodies." Our Authorized Version rendering, "riches <span class="accented">with</span> the dead bodies," of course both ingeniously glosses the difficulty and makes a sufficiently good meaning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:20-30 Jehoshaphat exhorted his troops to firm faith in God. Faith inspires a man with true courage; nor will any thing help more to the establishing of the heart in shaking times, than a firm belief of the power, and mercy, and promise of God. In all our trust in the Lord, and our praises of him, let us especially look at his everlasting mercy to sinners through Jesus Christ. Never was an army so destroyed as that of the enemy. Thus God often makes wicked people destroy one another. And never was a victory celebrated with more solemn thanksgivings.</body></html>
