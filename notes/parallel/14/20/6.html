The prayer before us invokes the one God "in heaven;" claims him the God "of our fathers;" recites his universal authority above, below; pleads his former conduct of the "people Israel," in especial his stablishing of that people in their present land; most touchingly recalls his covenant of condescending, everlasting "friendship" with Abraham, the grand original of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17-19, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>); makes mention of the consecration of the land by the sanctuary, and in particular of the very service of consecration and the special foreseeing provision in that service for a crisis like the present (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-33.htm">1 Kings 8:33-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-24.htm">2 Chronicles 6:24-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>); and then (vers. 10, 11) states pointedly the case and complaint with its aggravations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4, 8, 9, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-21.htm">Numbers 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-18.htm">Judges 11:18</a>), and with a parting appeal, confession of their own weakness, ignorance, and dependence unfeigned, commits the cause of the alarmed people to God. <span class="cmt_word">Our eyes are</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon thee.</span> So, with a multitude of other passages, that supreme pattern one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-2.htm">Psalm 123:2</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-13 In all dangers, public or personal, our first business should be to seek help from God. Hence the advantage of days for national fasting and prayer. From the first to the last of our seeking the Lord, we must approach him with humiliation for our sins, trusting only in his mercy and power. Jehoshaphat acknowledges the sovereign dominion of the Divine Providence. Lord, exert it on our behalf. Whom should we seek to, whom should we trust to for relief, but the God we have chosen and served. Those that use what they have for God, may comfortably hope he will secure it to them. Every true believer is a son of Abraham, a friend of God; with such the everlasting covenant is established, to such every promise belongs. We are assured of God's love, by his dwelling in human nature in the person of the Saviour. Jehoshaphat mentions the temple, as a token of God's favourable presence. He pleads the injustice of his enemies. We may well appeal to God against those that render us evil for good. Though he had a great army, he said, We have no might without thee; we rely upon thee.</body></html>
