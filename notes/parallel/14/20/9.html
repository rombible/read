and shall return and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;">2Chronicles 6:24-30</a>). The reference to this prayer implies a confidence that it had been accepted in heaven, as the sign that followed it indicated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/7-1.htm" title="Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.">2Chronicles 7:1-3</a>). Syriac, "<span class= "ital">When the sanctuary is amongst us,</span> there will not come upon us evil, nor sword, nor judgment, &c., and we will come and stand before this house, and before Thee, because Thy name is invoked in this house; and we will come and pray before Thee in this house and thou wilt hearken to the voice of our prayer, and deliver us." The Hebrew seems to say, "If there come upon us evil--sword (judgment), and pestilence and famine--we will stand (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> come forward) before this house, and before Thee, for Thy name is in this house, and we will cry unto Thee out of our distress, and Thou shalt (or <span class= "ital">that Thou mayest</span>) hear and save." The word rendered "judgment" (<span class= "ital">sh?ph?t</span>) is not used as a noun anywhere else; and, lacking a conjunction, it spoils the symmetry of the sentence. It is probably an ancient gloss. All the versions have it; and the Vulg. renders, "sword of judgment." (Comp. the Syriac in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-12.htm" title="O our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are on you.">2Chronicles 20:12</a>, <span class= "ital">infra.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-13 In all dangers, public or personal, our first business should be to seek help from God. Hence the advantage of days for national fasting and prayer. From the first to the last of our seeking the Lord, we must approach him with humiliation for our sins, trusting only in his mercy and power. Jehoshaphat acknowledges the sovereign dominion of the Divine Providence. Lord, exert it on our behalf. Whom should we seek to, whom should we trust to for relief, but the God we have chosen and served. Those that use what they have for God, may comfortably hope he will secure it to them. Every true believer is a son of Abraham, a friend of God; with such the everlasting covenant is established, to such every promise belongs. We are assured of God's love, by his dwelling in human nature in the person of the Saviour. Jehoshaphat mentions the temple, as a token of God's favourable presence. He pleads the injustice of his enemies. We may well appeal to God against those that render us evil for good. Though he had a great army, he said, We have no might without thee; we rely upon thee.</body></html>
