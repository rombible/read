And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.">2Kings 9:27-28</a> we find a different tradition concerning the death of Ahaziah. That passage, literally rendered, runs as follows: "And Ahaziah king of Judah had seen it (i.e., the death of Jehoram, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm" title="And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.">2Kings 9:24</a>), and he fled by the way of the garden palace, and Jehu pursued after him, and said, Him, too, smite (shoot) ye him in the chariot!--on the ascent of G-r, beside Ibleam; and he fled to Megiddo, and died there." (Perhaps <span class= "ital">and they smote him</span> has fallen out before the words <span class= "ital">on the ascent of G-r.</span>) "And his servants brought him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own grave, with his fathers, in the city of David." Such divergences are valuable, because they help to establish the independence of the two accounts.<p><span class= "bld">For he was hid.</span>--<span class= "ital">Now he was hiding.</span><p><span class= "bld">And when they had slain him.</span>--<span class= "ital">And they put him to death, and buried him; for they said,</span> &c.<p><span class= "bld">He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord.</span>--A didactic remark in the usual manner of the chronicler.<p><span class= "bld">So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And the house of Ahaziah had none to retain strength for kingship</span> (= capable of assuming the sovereignty). Another sentence marked throughout by the chronicler's own style. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-20.htm" title="Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.">2Chronicles 13:20</a>, "retained strength.") It forms the transition to the account of Athaliah's usurpation of the throne.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him... brought him... buried him.</span> This verse, which at the first sight seems at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27, 28</a>, is perhaps a simply surprising instance of undesigned corroboration of history by the treatment of different historians. The verse, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, corrects the italics of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>; expunging them throws their proper force into the words, "at the going up to Gur," showing that Jehu reckoned on that steep kill to enable his pursuing warriors to overtake Ahaziah; makes a sufficiently possible harmony, to say the least, in respect of the remaining incidents narrated of his life - that he made for the time a successful flight to Megiddo, afterwards sought to hide in deeper retirement in Samaria, was thence brought to Jehu at Megiddo, there eventually slain before his eyes, and by his own servants, who must be supposed to have had some attachment to him, but probably with the sanction of Jehu himself, conveyed "in a chariot to Jerusalem" for sepulture "in the sepulchre of his fathers in the city of David" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-28.htm">2 Kings 9:28</a>). The fact that he received decent burial being due to the God-fearing character of his grandfather, and that this should find its record on the page of the book that will last while the world lasts, that very page already two thousand five hundred years old, is a most touching consideration. Megiddo was on the Esdraelon or Jezreel plain, that stretched between the hills of Galilee and those of Mount Ephraim or Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Had no power to keep still the kingdom</span>. The undoubted meaning of this clause is that there was no one of the house of Ahaziah who could succeed him. The Hebrew text does not say, "no one left," etc. But the allusion can scarcely be to anything but the fact that transpires in our ver. 11 (where only Joash is mentioned as a son, and with him a nurse), viz. that his only surviving son was an infant, The king's sons (presumably sons of Ahaziah and grandsons of her own) were among the "seed royal," whom the wicked Athaliah had "destroyed." Gesenius says that the words that wrap in them the slight ambiguity, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, are a phrase peculiar to the later Hebrew, and he instances nine examples, all of which come from Daniel or Chronicles, the virtue of the phrase amounting to the <span class="accented">ports ease</span> of the Latin. Translate, <span class="accented">And there was no one of the house of Ahaziah able for the kingdom</span>, the exacter conditions of the case not being recorded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-12 The reign of Ahaziah, Athaliah destroys the royal family. - The counsel of the ungodly ruins many young persons when they are setting out in the world. Ahaziah gave himself up to be led by evil men. Those who advise us to do wickedly, counsel us to our destruction; while they pretend to be friends, they are our worst enemies. See and dread the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared, Re 18:4. We have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David, and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground. The whole truth of the prophecies that the Messiah was to come from David, and thereby the salvation of the world, appeared to be now hung upon the brittle thread of the life of a single infant, to destroy whom was the interest of the reigning power. But God had purposed, and vain were the efforts of earth and hell.</body></html>
