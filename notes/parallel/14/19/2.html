In the case of David, the Divine wrath was embodied in pestilence; what form did it take with Jehoshaphat? The following chapters seem to supply the answer. His land suffered invasion and his fleet shipwreck; his posterity was evil, and came to an evil end (2 Chronicles 20, 21, 22). There may be reference also to the failure of the campaign in which Jehoshaphat had engaged, and his inglorious return to his own land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him</span>. For Hanani, the faithful father of a faithful son, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>, where we read that he "came to Asa King of Judah," etc. Also for Jehu, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>, where we read of his commission at the word of the Lord to rebuke Baasha the King of Israel, at a date upwards of thirty years before the present; and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-34.htm">2 Chronicles 20:34</a>, which would lead us to infer, though not with certainty, that he outlived Jehoshaphat. The book called by his name, however, was not necessarily finished by him. It is evident that neither the word of the Lord nor the messengers and prophets of the Lord were bound by the orthodox limits of the divided kingdom. The powerful character and the moral force of the true prophet is again seen (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1-8</a>) in the way in which he was wont to <span class="accented">go</span> <span class="accented">out to meet</span> the evil-doer, though he were a king. We are accustomed to set the whole of this down to the account of the special inspiration of the prophet of old; yet <span class="accented">that</span> was but typical of the intrinsic force that truth faithfully spoken should wield in its own right in later times. Religion is <span class="accented">established</span> in the nation and people that know and do this, by the accredited teachers of it, vie. the plain rebuke of the wrong. <span class="cmt_word">Shouldest thou... love them that hate the Lord</span>? Strong suspicion must attend upon Jehoshaphat, that he had been not a little misled by answering to some personal fascination in Ahab. The prophet's rebuke is not that Jehoshaphat helped both Israel and therein Judah also against a common foe, but that he helped the ungodly, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore wrath upon thee</span>, etc. The significance of this sentence was probably not merely retrospective, glancing at the fact that Jehoshaphat returned to Jerusalem <span class="accented">minus</span> the victory for which he had bid, but was probably an intimation of troubles that should ripen, were already ripening for Jehoshaphat, in the coming invasion of his own kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-11 Jehoshaphat visits his kingdom. - Whenever we return in peace to our houses, we ought to acknowledge God's providence in preserving our going out and coming in. And if we have been kept through more than common dangers, we are, in a special manner, bound to be thankful. Distinguishing mercies lay us under strong obligations. The prophet tells Jehoshaphat he had done very ill in joining Ahab. He took the reproof well. See the effect the reproof had upon him. He strictly searched his own kingdom. By what the prophet said, Jehoshaphat perceived that his former attempts for reformation were well-pleasing to God; therefore he did what was then left undone. It is good when commendations quicken us to our duty. There are diversities of gifts and operations, but all from the same Spirit, and for the public good; and as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same. Blessed be God for magistrates and ministers, scribes and statesmen, men of books, and men of business. Observe the charge the king gave. They must do all in the fear of the Lord, with a perfect, upright heart. And they must make it their constant care to prevent sin, as an offence to God, and what would bring wrath on the people.</body></html>
