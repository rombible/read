This is confirmed by the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic, which read Maachah. As we have already stated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm" title="And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.">2Chronicles 11:20</a>), Maachah was <span class= "ital">granddaughter</span> to Absalom, being a daughter of Tamar the only daughter of Absalom. Uriel of Gibeah, then, must have been the husband of Tamar. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.">2Chronicles 15:16</a>. Uriel of Gibeah is otherwise unknown.)<p><span class= "bld">And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span>--<span class= "ital">Now war had arisen.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-6.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.">1Kings 15:6</a>. "Now war had prevailed [same verb] between Abijam [common Hebrew text incorrectly has <span class= "ital">Rehoboam]</span> and Jeroboam <span class= "ital">all the days of his life."</span> The chronicler modifies the sense by omitting the concluding phrase, and then proceeds to give a striking account of a campaign in which Abijah totally defeated his rival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/13-3.htm" title="And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.">2Chronicles 13:3-20</a>); of all which we find not a word in Kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah</span>. As before noted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), and as in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>), this name is one with "Maachah, daughter of Absalom" (parallel, <span class="accented">Abishalom</span>). The different alphabetic characters may be attributed to error, and that error the error of transcription merely. As in our note (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), the word "daughter," as in many similar cases, stands for granddaughter. Thus the father of Maachah was Uriel of Gibeah, and her mother Tamar, daughter of Absalom. Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:10. &sect; 1) proffers us this connecting link of explanation. On the other hand, Rabbi Joseph's Targum on Chronicles says that Uriel means Absalom, but was a name used to avoid the use of Absalom. We have no clue as to which out of many Gibeahs is here intended. The Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>) signifies a hill with round top, and hence would easily give name to many places. The following are the chief places of the name (as classified by Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:689-691): <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Gibeah in the mountain district of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-57.htm">Joshua 15:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-49.htm">1 Chronicles 2:49</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Gibeath among the towns of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The Gibeah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3, 4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Gibeah of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19, 20</a>.), between Bethlehem and Jerusalem. This should strictly be quoted either as "Gibeah belonging to Benjamin," or "Geba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) of Benjamin" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-29.htm">2 Samuel 23:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-31.htm">1 Chronicles 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-9.htm">Hosea 10:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Gibeah of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-34.htm">1 Samuel 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>). Josephus ('Bell, Jud.,' 5:2. &sect; 1) states what helps to the identifying of the place as the modern <span class="accented">Tuleil-el-ful</span>, about thirty stadia from Jerusalem (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>).

Lastly, our Authorized Version gives us seven other Gibeahs, only translating this word, e g.

It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.</body></html>
