The expressions of the text cannot mean, as Z�ckler suggests, "visited him with misfortune till his death." His death is regarded as a judicial visitation (compare the use of the same Hebrew phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-38.htm" title="And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.">1Samuel 25:38</a>). The verse, then, states that during the rest of Abijah's reign Jeroboam remained powerless to injure his neighbour; and that the circumstances of his death were such that men recognised in them "the finger of God." It is not likely that the reference is to the event of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm" title="Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.">2Chronicles 13:15</a> (Bertheau), nor to the death of his son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/14-1.htm" title="At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.">1Kings 14:1-8</a>), as Keil supposes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord struck him; and he died</span>. The writer of Chronicles here, for brevity's sake, and not to recur to his name again, records the death of Jeroboam, which, however, did not happen till after Abijah's death, in the second year of Asa's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-20.htm">1 Kings 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25</a>). That the <span class="accented">Lord struck</span> him, may glance at the fearful announcement conveyed to him through his wife by Ahijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-6.htm">1 Kings 14:6-16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-22 Abijah overcomes Jeroboam. - Jeroboam and his people, by apostacy and idolatry, merited the severe punishment Abijah was permitted to execute upon them. It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.</body></html>
