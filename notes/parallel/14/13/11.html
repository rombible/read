The Syriac reads, "and the golden lampstands and their lamps; and the lamp-boy lighteth them every evening." It is noticeable that only one table and one candlestick are mentioned here. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/4-7.htm" title="And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.">2Chronicles 4:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-19.htm" title="And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables where on the show bread was set;">2Chronicles 4:19</a>.)<p>The observance of these details of ritual is called "keeping the charge of Jehovah" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-35.htm" title="Therefore shall you abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that you die not: for so I am commanded.">Leviticus 8:35</a>), and neglect of them is "forsaking" Him. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-10.htm" title="But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister to the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait on their business:">2Chronicles 13:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-22 Abijah overcomes Jeroboam. - Jeroboam and his people, by apostacy and idolatry, merited the severe punishment Abijah was permitted to execute upon them. It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.</body></html>
