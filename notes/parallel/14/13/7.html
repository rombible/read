Neither this nor the following phrase, "the children of Belial" (literally, <span class= "ital">sons of worthlessness, i.e.,</span> men of low character and estimation) occurs again in the Chronicles. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-22.htm" title="Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.">Judges 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-13.htm" title="Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.">Judges 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm" title="And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king.

The expression is somewhat inexact, as Rehoboam was forty-one when he ascended the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm" title="So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.

But Abijah is naturally anxious to put the case as strongly as possible against Jeroboam, and to avoid all blame of his own father. In 2 Chronicles 10 Rehoboam appears as haughty and imperious, rather than timid and soft-hearted.<p><span class= "bld">Could not withstand them.</span>--Did <span class= "ital">not show himself strong or firm</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm" title="So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.

The aorist tense is needed for the rendering in both these cases; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "And vain men gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against him." <span class="cmt_word">Vain men</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This word, and one very slightly different in form, and their adverb, occur in all forty-one times; rendered in the Authorized Version "empty" nineteen times, "vain" eighteen times, and "without cause," "to no purpose," and "void" the remaining four times. It is the word that is used of the "empty" pit of Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>); of the "empty ears" of corn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>); of "empty" pitchers and other vessels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a>). And in all the other cases expresses metaphorically the emptiness of head, of heart, or of reason, with the same simple force of language appropriate, it appears, then as now. <span class="cmt_word">Children of Belial</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>. This word is found twenty-seven times, and, including seven marginal options, is rendered in the Authorized Version "Belial" twenty-three times; the four exceptions being "wicked" three times, and "naughty" once. The derivation of it marks the one expressive meaning of "without profit." <span class="cmt_word">Young and tender-hearted</span>. Hard as it is to put these objections to the credit of a man forty-one years of age (see our note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>) at all, yet, if so, they can only be explained as some do explain them, of a blamable ignorance, inexperience, and instability. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-22 Abijah overcomes Jeroboam. - Jeroboam and his people, by apostacy and idolatry, merited the severe punishment Abijah was permitted to execute upon them. It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.</body></html>
