This curious statement answers to what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm" title="And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.">1Kings 6:3</a> : <span class= "ital">"</span>And the porch before the hall of the house, twenty cubits was its length, before the breadth of the house." But the Hebrew is too singular to pass without challenge, and comparison of the versions suggests that we ought to read here: "<span class= "ital">And the porch which was before it</span> (Syriac), or <span class= "ital">before the house</span> (LXX.), <span class= "ital">its length before the breadth of the house was twenty cubits."</span> This would involve but slight alteration of the Hebrew text. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-8.htm" title="And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.">2Chronicles 3:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And the height was an hundred and twenty.</span> This would make the porch four times the height of the main building, which was thirty cubits. The Alexandrine MS. of the LXX., and the Arabic version, read "twenty cubits;" the Syriac omits the whole clause,, which has no parallel in Kings, and is further suspicious as wanting the word "cubits," usually expressed after the number (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-3.htm" title="Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was three score cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.">2Chronicles 3:3</a>). The Hebrew may be a corruption of the clause, "and its breadth ten cubits." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm" title="And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.">1Kings 6:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And he overlaid it within with pure gold.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-21.htm" title="So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.">1Kings 6:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The porch... an hundred and twenty.</span> The "porch" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). It is out of the question that the porch should be of this height in itself. And almost as much out of the question that, if it could be so, this should be the only place to mention it by word or. description. There can be no doubt that the text is here slightly corrupt, and perhaps it is a further indication of this that, while the parallel contains <span class="accented">nothing</span> of the height, <span class="accented">this</span> place fails (but comp. our ver. 8) to give the breadth ("ten cubits"), which the parallel does give. The words for" hundred" and for "cubit" easily confuse with one another. And our present Hebrew text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, will make good Hebrew syntax, and be in harmony with the Septuagint (Alexandrian), and with the Syriac and Arabic Versions. This gives the height of the porch as 20 cubits, which will be in harmony with the general height of the building, which was 30 cubits. Thus far, then, the plan of the temple is plain. The house is 60 cubits long, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 20 for the holy of holies (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>);40 for the holy place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>); and for breadth 20 cubits. The porch was in <span class="accented">length</span> the same as the breadth of the <span class="accented">house</span>, viz. 20 cubits, but in <span class="accented">breadth</span> it was 10 cubits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>) only, while its height was 20 cubits, against a height of 30 cubits for the "house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Overlaid it within with pure gold</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> covered the planks with gold leaf, or sometimes with plates of gold (Ovid., 'L Epp. ex. Pont,' 1:37, 38, 41, 42; Herod., 1:98; Polyb., 10:27. &sect; 10). The appreciation, as well as bare knowledge, of gold belonged to a very early date (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a>). The days when it was used in ring or lump (though not in coin) for sign of wealth and for purposes of exchange, and also for ornament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>), indicate how early were the beginnings of metallurgy as regards it, though much more developed afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>); and show it in the time of David and Solomon no rare art, even though foreign workmen, for obvious reasons, were the most skilful workers with it. There are four verbs used to express the idea of overlaying, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, in hiph. This occurs only in this chapter, vers. 5, 7, 8, 9; but in niph. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a> may be compared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in hiph. This occurs in the present sense, though not necessarily staying very closely by it; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15, 16</a>, and its parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16, 17</a>); and perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>. The meaning of the word, however, is evidently so generic that it scarcely postulates the rendering "overlay." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in piel. This occurs in our present verse, as also in a multitude of other places in Chronicles, Kings, Samuel, and Exodus. The radical idea of the verb (kal) is "to be bright." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> in hiph. This occurs only once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-32.htm">1 Kings 6:32</a>). No one of these verbs in itself bespeaks certainly of which or what kind the overlaying might be, unless it be the last, the analogy of which certainly points to the sense of a thin <span class="accented">spreading.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-17 The building of the temple. - There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in #1Ki 6". It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.</body></html>
