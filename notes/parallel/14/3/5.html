This rendering is wrong. The verb is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> given above (ver. 4). It is repeated in the next clause of this very verse as "overlaid," as also in vers. 7, 8, 9. The generic word "covered" would serve all the occasions on which the word occurs here. From a comparison of the parallel it becomes plain that the meaning is that the crone structure of floor and walls was covered over with wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7, 15, 18</a>). That wood for the floor was <span class="accented">fir</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>), probably slim for the <span class="accented">walls</span>, which must depend partly on the translation of this ver. 15. It would seem to say that (beside the stone) there was an inner stratum, both to walls and floor, of <span class="accented">cedar</span> (reason for which would be easy of conjecture). But another translation obviates the necessity of this inner stratum supposition, rendering "from the floor to the top of the wall." According to this, while the overlaying gold was on cedar for walls and ceiling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>), it was on fir for the floor, which does <span class="accented">not seem what our</span> present verse purports, unless, according to the suggestion of some, "fir" be interpreted to include cedar. <span class="cmt_word">Set thereon palm trees and chains</span>. These were, of course, <span class="accented">carvings.</span> The <span class="accented">chains</span>, not mentioned in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; but see 1 Kings 7:17), were probably wreaths of chain design or pattern. Easier modern English would read "put thereon." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-17 The building of the temple. - There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in #1Ki 6". It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.</body></html>
