The exact manner in which these were applied or fixed is not stated.

What this word designates, or, if a place, where the place was, is not known. Gesenius ('Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub vet.</span>) would derive it from a Sanskrit word, purva, meaning "oriental." Hitzig suggests another Sanskrit word, <span class="accented">paru</span>, meaning "hill," and indicating the "twin hills" of Arabia (Prof., 6:7. &sect; 11) as the derivation. And Knobel suggests that it is a form of <span class="accented">Sepharvaim</span>, the Syriac and Jonathan Targum version of <span class="accented">Sephar</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-30.htm">Genesis 10:30</a>). The word does not occur in any other Bible passage (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. it. p. 711). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-17 The building of the temple. - There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in #1Ki 6". It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.</body></html>
