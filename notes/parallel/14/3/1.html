(Comp. "the land of Moriah," the place appointed for the sacrifice of Isaac, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Where the Lord appeared unto David his father.</span>--So LXX.; rather, who <span class= "ital">appeared unto David his father.</span> Such is the meaning according to the common use of words. There is clearly an allusion to the etymology of MORIAH, which is assumed to signify "appearance of Jah." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm" title="And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.">Genesis 22:14</a>.) Translate, "in the mount of the Appearance of Jah, who appeared unto David his father." The Vulgate reads: "in Monte Moria qui <span class= "ital">demonstratus fuerat</span> David patri ejus;" but <span class= "ital">nir'ah</span> never means <span class= "ital">to be shown</span> or <span class= "ital">pointed out.</span> The Syriac, misunderstanding the LXX.

This name <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> occurs twice in the Old Testament, viz. here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>, in which latter reference it is alluded to as "the <span class="accented">land</span> of Moriah," and "one of the mountains" in it is spoken cf. Whether the name designates the same place in each instance is more than doubtful. In the present passage the connection of the place with David is marked. Had it been the spot connected with Abraham and the proposed sacrifice of Isaac, it is at least probable that this also would have been emphasized, and not here only, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17-25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16-26</a>; but in neither of these places is there the remotest suggestion of such fame of old belonging to it. Nor in later passages of history (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Nehemiah's rebuilding, and in the prophets, and the New Testament), where the opportunities would have been of the most tempting, is there found one single suggestion of the kind. There am also at fewest two reasons of a positive and intriusic character against Solomon's Moriah being Abraham's - in that this latter was a specially conspicuous height (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>), and was a secluded and comparatively desolate place, neither of which features attach to Solomon's Moriah. Nevertheless the identity theory is stoutly maintained by names as good as those of Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 475); Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 152); Hengstenberg ('Genuineness of Pentateuch, 2:162, Ryland's tr.); Kurtz ('History of O. C.,' 1:271); and Knobel and Kalisch under the passage in Genesis - against Grove (in Dr. Smith's ' Bible Dictionary'); Stanley (' Sinai and Palestine,' p. 251;'Jewish Church,' 1. 49); De Wette, Bleek, and Tischendorf [see 'Speaker's Commentary,' under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>]. Though there is some uncertainty as to the more exact form of the derivation of the name Moriah, it seems most probable that the meaning of it may be "the sight of Jehovah." Where <span class="cmt_word">the Lord appeared unto David his father.</span> The clause is no doubt elliptical, and probably it is not to be mended by the inserting of the words," the Lord," as in our Authorized Version. We do not read anywhere that the Lord did then and there appear to David, though we do read that "the angel of the Lord" appeared to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15, 19</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>). Nor is it desirable to force the niph. preterite of the verb here, rightly rendered "appeared" or "was seen," into "was shown." We should prefer to solve the difficulty occasioned by the somewhat unfinished shape of the clause (or clauses) by reading it in close relation to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-1.htm">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>. Then the vivid impressions that had been made both by works and words of the angel of the Lord caused David to feel and to say with emphasis, "This is the (destined) house of the Lord God," etc. In this light our present passage would read, in a parenthetic manner, "which (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the house, its Moriah position and all) was seen of David;" or with somewhat more of ease, "as was seen of David;" and the following "in the place," etc., will read in a breath with the preceding "began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem... in the place," etc. <span class="cmt_word">David had prepared</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the threshing-floor of Ornan</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15, 16, 18, 21-28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-17 The building of the temple. - There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in #1Ki 6". It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.</body></html>
