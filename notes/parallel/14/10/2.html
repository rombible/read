The chronicler has omitted to say he was <span class= "ital">still</span> in Egypt (<span class= "ital">'odenn-,</span> Kings), because he has not alluded before to his flight thither. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-26.htm" title="And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.">1Kings 11:26-40</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</span>--Kings continues the parenthesis, "and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt." The words <span class= "ital">dwelt</span> and <span class= "ital">returned</span> are spelt with the same letters in Hebrew, the difference being one of pointing only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - In these verses the compiler brings up lost time. He has not mentioned before the name of Jeroboam, just as he has not mentioned the lustful sins of Solomon that led to idolatry, and these sequel idolatries of his, that heralded the shattering of his kingdom immediately on his decease. So we are now told all in one how Jeroboam, in his refuge-retreat in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>), "heard" of Solomon's demise, and apparently (see first clause of our third verse) heard of it in this wise, that "they," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "all Israel" (of our first verse) "had sent and called him" Probably the growing sense of discontent and the rankling in those tribes that were not closely breathing the atmosphere of Jerusalem and the one home county, because of their burdens and taxation, and possibly also Ephraim's ancient and famed rivalry, knew instinctively that this hour of Solomon's death was the hour, if any, of their redemption. The <span class="accented">lacunae</span> in the history speak for themselves; for though the tribes, after the long seething of their com-plainings and sufferings, needed but short time for deliberation, Solomon's death must have been an accomplished fact before they (whoever the "they" were) sent to Egypt to Jeroboam; and that sending and his returning or otherwise, at any rate his hearing and consequent returning, must have taken time. Considering all this, it <span class="accented">is re</span>markable that no note of time is found. But had only our first verse been placed as the last of the foregoing chapter, the ambiguity would have been less. For the strange variations on the history of Jeroboam (a name, together with that of Rehoboam, new to Solomon's time, meaning "many-peopled," while Rehoboam signifies "increaser of people"), as found in the Hebrew texts, and additions to it, see the Septuagint Version, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-24.htm">1 Kings 12:24</a>; and A. P. Stanley's article, "Jeroboam," in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. 979, 980; and comp. again <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-13.htm">1 Kings 14:13, 17, 18</a>. Stanley's faith in the Septuagint notwithstanding, its variations and additions are not reconcileable enough with either the Hebrew text or themselves to command anything like unfeigned acceptance. One thing may be considered to come out without much obscurity or uncertainty - that Jeroboam was the acknowledged rather than tacit leader of an opposition that was tacit at present rather than acknowledged; nor is it at all improbable, under all the circumstances, that the Rehoboam party <span class="accented">in</span>, knowing well how the ground really lay, were as content to let the coronation, so to call it, at Shechem linger awhile for Jeroboam's return, as Jeroboam's opposition party <span class="accented">out</span> desired and perhaps compelled the delay. Of course, Jeroboam knew well, none better than he, as of old the overseer of the forced labour and taxation of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), how grievous the service and how heavy the yoke to his people, even when he had acquitted himself as the most "industrious" of taskmasters. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-19 The ten tribes revolt from Rehoboam. - Moderate counsels are wisest and best. Gentleness will do what violence will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Good words cost only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things. No more needs to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their own pride and passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doing his own work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. No man can bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom; though our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whether good or bad. Let us then seek those good things which will be our own for ever; and crave the blessing of God upon our posterity, in preference to wealth or worldly exaltation.</body></html>
