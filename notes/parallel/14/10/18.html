Rehoboam made speed... to flee.</span> Hadoram was perhaps the same as Adoniram, son of Abda (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>), but on the arbitrament of age this is less likely, and certainly it is very unlikely that he was one with Hadoram of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>. Rehoboam must be supposed to have sent Hadoram either to make some "tribute" summons, or try some arrangement respecting it, or respecting conciliatory steps. The reception he met warns Rehoboam to make the quickest escape possible, and no doubt opens his eyes fully to what he has done. It was the remanet of his delusive self-confidence to send this collector of taxes to those who had begged some remission of taxation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-19 The ten tribes revolt from Rehoboam. - Moderate counsels are wisest and best. Gentleness will do what violence will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Good words cost only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things. No more needs to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their own pride and passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doing his own work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. No man can bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom; though our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whether good or bad. Let us then seek those good things which will be our own for ever; and crave the blessing of God upon our posterity, in preference to wealth or worldly exaltation.</body></html>
