The omission of these words in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>) is remarkable in the light of what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>. We find the contents of this verse again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-27.htm">2 Chronicles 9:27</a>; as also in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>), just quoted with the exception already named. <span class="cmt_word">Cedar trees</span>. The meaning is felled trunks of cedar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-4.htm">1 Chronicles 22:4</a>) (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). Whether the wood intended is the cedar of Lebanon (<span class="accented">Pinus cedrus</span>, or <span class="accented">Cedrus conifera</span>), "tall" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>), "widespreading" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>), odoriferous, with very few knots, and wonderfully resisting decay, is considered by authorities on such subjects still uncertain. Gesenius, in his 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voc</span>., may be consulted, and the various Bible dictionaries, especially Dr. Smith's, under "Cedar;" and Dr. Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' under "Eres." The writer in Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary' suggests that under the one word "cedar," the <span class="accented">Pinus cedrus, Pinus deodara, Yew, Taxus baccata</span>, and <span class="accented">Pinus sylvestris</span> (Scotch pine) were referred to popularly, and were employed when building purposes are in question. That the said variety was employed is likely enough, but that we are intended to understand this when the word "cedar" is used seems unlikely (see for further indication of this unlikeliness, the instancing of "firs" occasionally with "cedars," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sycomore trees</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). This word is found always in its present masc. plur. form except once, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>, where the plur. fem. form is found. The Greek equivalent in the Septuagint is always <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; but in the New Testament, and in the same treatise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Gospel according to St. Luke, we find both <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a> and Luke 19:4 respectively). Now, the former of these trees is the well. known mulberry tree. But the latter is what is called the <span class="accented">fig-mulberry</span>, or the <span class="accented">sycamore-fig</span>; and this is the tree of the Old Testament. Its fruit resembles the fig, grows on sprigs shooting out of the thick stems themselves of the tree, and each fruit needs to be <span class="accented">punctured</span> a few days before gathering, if it is to be acceptable eating (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the vale</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the lowland country, called the Shefelah.
