The verb <span class= "ital">hast asked</span> is expressed in better idiom than in Kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - With this verse the answer to Solomon's prayer begins. It is here concisely given in two verses, but occupies five (vers. 10-14) in the parallel place, including the verse not found here, which says, "The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing." Otherwise there is no essential difference of any importance, though it may be noted that the parallel gives voice to the promise of "length of days," on the condition of Solomon fulfilling his part in showing obedience to the Divine will, and in following the steps of his father. <span class="cmt_word">Riches, wealth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The most elementary idea of the former of these two words seems to be "straight growth," "prosperity;" of the latter, "to gather together" or "heap up." The former is found first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-16.htm">Genesis 31:16</a>; and in the verb (hiph. conjugation) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-23.htm">Genesis 14:23</a>. Afterwards it is found in almost all of the historical books, in the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and in the prophets Jeremiah and Daniel. The latter word occurs only five times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>; in this and the following verses; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>). Its Chaldee form is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a> and Ezra 7:26. A comparison of these passages scarcely sustains the supposition of some, suggested by the derivation of the word, that it marks specially those stores of useful things which constituted largely the wealth of Old Testament times. <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom and knowledge</span>. The distinction between these is evident, as also that they are needful complements of one another for the forming of a catholic, useful, sound character. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
