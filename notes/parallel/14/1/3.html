Solomon repaired to Gibeon because "that was the great high place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1Kings 3:4</a>). We learn from our text why Gibeon stood pre-eminent above the other high places. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-31.htm" title="And these are they whom David set over the service of song in the house of the LORD, after that the ark had rest.">1Chronicles 6:31</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,">1Chronicles 16:39</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - All the congregation; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the persons of their captains, judges, princes, and family representatives. <span class="cmt_word">The high place... at Gibeon</span>. It may readily be allowed that even nature and instinct would suggest a certain fitness in selecting <span class="accented">high</span> places, and the impressive grandeur of groves, for the worship of the High and Lofty One and for the offerings of sacrifice to him. It was not otherwise historically (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>). However<span class="accented">, first</span>, it was part of the education of a nation (situated in the heart of the young world) in the unity of the one God, that its worship should be offered in one place, and the smoke of its sacrifices ascend from <span class="accented">one</span> altar; and <span class="accented">secondly</span>, it was not difficult to foresee that the very force that lay in the associations, which dictated the choice of some places (not least, certainly, "the grove"), would constitute their weakness and snare. The prohibitions, therefore, of the Mosaic Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26</a>), witnessed to by such corroborations as are found in commands to obliterate certain Canaanitish traces, that looked long time a different way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-29.htm">Joshua 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a>), approve themselves as in thorough harmony with what all would feel to be the genius of the religious education of Israel, and, through Israel, of the nations of the world. The wonder that impresses us is rather that means were not found to abide by the "letter" of the Law to a far greater degree during all the generations that elapsed before the people were settled in their land, and were gathered in their temple so typical. Is it not possible to regard this as an impressive instance of how, even in a system that sought to be of the closest and most exclusive, the "<span class="accented">spirit</span>," by force of circumstances, resented the tyrannous bondage of the "letter"? Anyway, for ages from the time of that prohibition, the nation had the moral principle as their guide rather than any possibility of keeping safe within a commandment's "letter" (so see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>). Even now, accordingly, the prohibited is still the observed, and by Solomon, too, in the steps of David, even if it be necessary to describe it as the "winked at." And to the "high place" at Gibeon Solomon and all the representatives, <span class="accented">the congregation</span> of Israel, have to repair in order to do sacrifice. The tabernacle was now at Gibeon, whither it had come from Nob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1, 6</a>; from which latter reference, speaking of the "shew-bread," it comes that we know the tabernacle to have resided at Nob awhile; for the circumstance is not positively narrated in any passage of the history (but see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9, 11</a>). <span class="accented">Gibeon</span> was one of the four Hivite cities, the other three being Beeroth, Chephirah, and Kirjath-jearim. It had its first fame from its "wiliness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 4</a>, etc.). By the directest road, it was five miles distant from Jerusalem, in the direction of the sea. It was further noted for the encounter between Joab and Abner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). Again, for the slaying of Amasa by Joab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-6.htm">2 Samuel 20:6-10</a>), and for the death of Joab himself at the hand of Benalak, at the very horns of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-34</a>). Although the exact date of the lodging of the tabernacle at Gibeon is not told us, nor even the person who was answerable for briging it there, yet there can be no reasonable doubt that it was David, as we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>) of his appointing the priests to offer "the daily sacrifices" there, on the brazen altar of Moses, when Zadok was at their head, and Heman and Jeduthun were their resident musicians. In what particular part of Gibeon or of its immediate neighbourhood the tabernacle was stationed cannot be said with any certainty. Amid a considerable choice of likely places, one forming part of Gibeon itself, and just south of <span class="accented">El-Tib</span>, seems the likeliest, and to be preferred to the suggestion of Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 216), of <span class="accented">Neby-Samuil</span>, which is a mile distant. The present imposing occasion is the last of any importance on which Gibeon is brought before us (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There was the tabernacle</span>. The removal of the tabernacle to Gibeon no doubt followed immediately on the destruction of Nob by Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>, compared with 37; 21:28, 29). <span class="cmt_word">Moses... made in the wilderness</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 26, 27, 33:7-10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
