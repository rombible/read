It is noteworthy that, though the equivalent of this phrase is found in the parallel, the distinctiveness of this <span class="accented">simile</span> is not found there. (For the use of the simile to express a vast number, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>.) It is not at all of frequent use in Scripture. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
