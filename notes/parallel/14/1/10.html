For the rest of this verse, the parallel passage has "an understanding heart" in place of our "wisdom <span class="accented">and knowledge</span>;" and "that I may discern between good and bad," in place of our <span class="cmt_word">that I may go out and come in before this people</span>. In using the words, "wisdom and knowledge," Solomon seems to have remembered well the prayer of his father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12</a>). (For the pedigree of the simple and effective phrase, "know how to go out and come in," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>). It is at the same time refreshing to revisit the times when the most exalted nominal ruler was also the real ruler, as being the leader, the judge, the teacher in the highest sense, and "the feeder" of his people. Nor is it less refreshing to notice how, in Israel at least, the fact was so well recognized and honoured, that <span class="accented">justice</span> and <span class="accented">to judge just judgment</span> lay at the deepest foundation of civil society. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
