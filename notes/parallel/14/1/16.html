and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:10</a> [of the waters]). The repetition of this term constitutes a kind of artless play on words, such as is common in the Old Testament. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-16.htm" title="And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps on heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.">Judges 15:16</a>.) Both here and in Kings the Vulg. renders the word as a proper name, "from Coa." So also the LXX. in Kings "from Thekkoue" (Tekoa); and the Syriac of Chronicles, "from the city of the Aphel?v?." These variations only prove that the text was felt to be obscure. The "linen yarn" of the Authorised version is a guess based upon the likeness of the word <span class= "ital">miqweh</span> to <span class= "ital">qaw,</span> "rope," and <span class= "ital">tiqw?h, "</span>line<span class= "ital">"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-18.htm" title="Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall bring your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household, home to you.">Joshua 2:18</a>), and upon the fact that much linen was made in Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Horses brought.., out of Egypt.</span> Later on we read that horses were imported from other countries as well (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-24.htm">2 Chronicles 9:24, 28</a>), as, for instance, from Arabia and Armenia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Linen yarn</span>. The words are without doubt wrong here. But it is impossible to say with any certainty what should be in their place. The Vulgate shows here <span class="accented">from Coa</span>, presumably meaning Tekoa, a small place on the road from Egypt to Jerusalem. It might not have been easy to surmise, however, so much as this, but for the fact that the Septuagint shows in the parallel place, "And from Tekoa" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>). The Septuagint, however, has for the present place, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> The Hebrew word here translated "linen yarn" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;</span> (i.q. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> niph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to be gathered together").' Gesenius, followed by De Wette (and others), and himself following Piscator (born tire. 1480) and Vatablus (born <span class="accented">circ</span>. 1546), would translate the word "company," and read, "a company of the king's merchants took a company (of horses) at a price." Others would translate the word "import;" and read, "the import of the king's merchants was an import at a price," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in money. Neither of these renderings can be considered really satisfactory. Some slight corruption of text still baulks us, therefore. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
