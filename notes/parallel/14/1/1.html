The parallels of this very simple and natural expression are too numerous for quotation. Some of the earliest are found in well-known connections in the Book of Genesis, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Genesis 21:22; 26:28; 28:15, 20; 31:3. Again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-13.htm">Judges 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-9.htm">1 Chronicles 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-11.htm">1 Chronicles 22:11, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-14.htm">Amos 5:14</a>. The beautiful New Testament equivalent occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>, and elsewhere. Like some other of those earliest concisest religious expressions, brevity and simplicity are fully charged with suggestion. And the above quotations will be found to furnish examples of the manifold practical use of the Lord's <span class="accented">presence</span> with any one. That presence may infer the help just of companionship, or of sure sympathy, or of needed counsel, or of strength in the hour of temptation, or of absolute practical help, or of the highest revealings of faith. The whole circle of need, of human and Christian need, the Divine presence "will supply" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The "need" of Solomon in his present position was patent and pressing. Would that he had always kept by the true supply of it! <span class="cmt_word">Magnified him exceedingly</span>. This verb in its piel conjugation, signifying "to make grow," occurs twenty-six times in the various books of the Old Testament, some of the more characteristic occurrences of it being found in the following passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-17.htm">Joshua 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-37.htm">1 Kings 1:37, 47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-6.htm">2 Kings 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-31.htm">Psalm 69:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-5.htm">Daniel 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
