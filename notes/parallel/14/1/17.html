Some add up in this amount the vehicle itself, harness, horse or horses necessary to it, and the expense of <span class="accented">carriage</span> of the whole. Whether or no horses are included may be doubtful. The amount added up reaches, according to various estimates, &pound;90 or &pound;70. If we take the silver shekel at 3s. 4d. according to one of the later authorities (Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 81, 2nd edit.), the amount will be &pound;100; and so for a horse &pound;25. <span class="cmt_word">For all the kings of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Hittites, and the kings of Syria;</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-14.htm">2 Chronicles 9:14, 23, 24, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; which last place in particular suggests that Solomon would be the more willing to <span class="accented">assist</span> neighbouring peoples in the purchase of horses, etc., who might be already tributary to him, or even vassals, or who might in future be in the better position to help him, when either required or hired to do so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
