This statement is introduced to lay stress on the fact that, though the ark indeed was not with the tabernacle, the brazen altar of burnt offering assuredly was there, this constituting the place, the proper spot, for sacrifice and worship. (For the account of the brazen altar and its making, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-38.htm">Numbers 16:38, 39</a>.) This altar of burnt offering is often spoken of as the altar, to distinguish it from the altar of incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel</span>. (For detailed genealogy, see our <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-3.htm">1 Chronicles 2:3-20</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He put before</span>. The reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), "was <span class="accented">there</span> before<span class="accented"></span>," is to be preferred, tallying as it does exactly with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-6.htm">Exodus 40:6</a>. This was the reading understood by the Septuagint and Vulgate. The majority of manuscripts, however, and the Syriac Version, have <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Sought</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto it</span>. The analogy of the use of this word would make to be preferred the translation "sought him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "Jehovah" just spoken cf. But whether the object of the verb be in this place Jehovah or the altar, it would seem probable that the clause purports to say that Solomon and his people were accustomed to repair thither, while now they were about to repair thither with a very vast burnt offering. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.</body></html>
