While other history shows frequently the abounding Eastern delight in this exact kind of composition, it will be remembered that it is not absent from Scripture, and that this is not the first recorded instance of it by three hundred and fifty years, for see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-15</a>. The <span class="accented">thistle</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>. The word occurs, beside the four times here and in the parallel, eight other times: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm">Job 41:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-9.htm">Proverbs 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-2.htm">Song of Solomon 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>.

A man's pride will bring him low, Pr 29:23; it goes before his destruction, and deservedly brings it on. He that exalteth himself shall be abased. He that goes forth hastily to strive, will not know what he shall do in the end thereof, when his neighbour has put him to shame, Pr 25:8. And what are we when we offer to establish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves before the Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselves stately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not every corruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on the wretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust? A man's pride shall bring him low; his ruin may be dated from his turning from the Lord.</body></html>
