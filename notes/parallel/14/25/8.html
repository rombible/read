The ancient versions were evidently embarrassed by the passage. The LXX. render: "Because if thou think to prevail through them, <span class= "ital">then will the Lord rout thee before thy foes;</span> because it is from the Lord both to be strong and to rout." Vulg.: "But if thou thinkest that wars depend on the strength of an army, <span class= "ital">God will make thee to be overcome by the enemy."</span> Syriac: "Because thou art going to make war, <span class= "ital">the Lord will cast thee down before thy foes;</span> because thou hast not praised the Lord, who is the helper and uplifter." It is noticeable that no version inserts the required negative; the omission, therefore, is ancient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - It is hard to feel satisfied as to the correct rendering of this verse. The drift of the <span class="accented">next</span> verse, which shows Amaziah a convert to the strong exhortation of the man of God, makes either alternative allowable under the present text very untimely. and not very much in accord with what we should look for at the lips of the man of God. The very conceivable way out of the difficulty is to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, hyphened to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dd;</span> (all the rather that no <span class="accented">vau</span> is present in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, as the present text is), and proceed to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span> again before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, crediting some copyist with confusion of eye through these having come close together in his manuscript. The rendering will then be straightforward, and prepare the way for Amaziah's yielding conformably with the tenor of the next verse. "But if not" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> if thou wilt not be guided by my remonstrance as to Ephraim), "go thou, be on the alert, exert all the strength possible for the battle, and yet nevertheless God will cause thee to stumble." And the remaining sentence may bear this significance, "For God hath power to help thee though alone, or to cast thee down though supported by an extra hundred thousand." If such alteration or conjectural restoration of the text be not accepted, we may harmonize the facts of the case with the most utter faithfulness of lip on the part of the prophet, by translating, "For in very truth, if thou go at all, and though thou make the best preparations, God shall make it go ill with thee." And Amaziah is persuaded to <span class="accented">this</span> point, that he will neither risk the lives of them of Ephraim vainly, nor risk the likelier displeasure of God on himself. He yields only partly, and therefore is nothing benefited. The difficulty is left untouched, that the prophet did not simply <span class="accented">in toto</span> forbid Amaziah to go, and that, saving them of Ephraim, he saves them to be a second scourge for the back of Amaziah, though he took his prophet's advice so far, and <span class="accented">lost his</span> own money. A careful and devout observer of human life and perverseness, when once these commit themselves to the vain struggle with God, and equally vain attempt to haggle with his providence as to how much to yield and how much to resist and with. hold, cannot but be struck with the photograph here thrown off, and that it is a faithful one, of hard facts that have met together disastrously times without number in men's lives. The sum, then, of the matter of our vers. 7, 8 may amount to this: "Under no circumstances take Israel, and if thou go thyself with all best preparations, yet know that God shall destroy thee." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-13 Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.</body></html>
