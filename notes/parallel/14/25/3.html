Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. This is kal conjugation of the verb, which we found in piel in ver. 5 of foregoing chapter, and there rendered "repair." The kal force of the word is simply to "be strong" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a>). The hiph., to "make strong," or "confirm," as it is rendered here, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>. Again and again the disorders of the kingdom and the violent deaths of prophets and kings must have greatly contributed to nervous apprehensions, in fact only too just, when a new king ascended the throne. In the parallel and in passage last quoted the words, "in his hand," follow the verb. Amaziah both needed to get his own hand in, according to modern phrase, and to get things well into his hand. <span class="cmt_word">His servants</span>. It may be held surprising that they should have been found "in the <span class="accented">place</span>," or should now be <span class="accented">his servants</span> at all. The explanation may be either that their guilt had not yet been known, or, if <span class="accented">known</span>, had not been fixed upon them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-13 Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.</body></html>
