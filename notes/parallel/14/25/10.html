The 'Speaker's Commentary' very aptly cites the keen resentment and mortification that the Athenians are recorded to have felt in similar circumstances as told in Plutarch's 'Lives:' "Cimon," &sect;17. <span class="cmt_word">Separated them.</span> This is the verb occurring several times in the first verses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>); there it is always followed by the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, when speaking of the separating of two things <span class="accented">from</span> one another. Though this be meant here, it is not what is exactly said, and the prefix preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>before the substantive (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>) may, as Keil says, be regarded as designating the appositional accusative to that affixed in the shape of the pronoun "them" to the verb. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-13 Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.</body></html>
