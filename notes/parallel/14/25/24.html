The Vulg. gives the verb <span class= "ital">returned</span> at the end of the verse a transitive form, and renders "he carried back to Samaria" all the things enumerated. The Syriac reads, "and he took the silver," &c.<p><span class= "bld">With Obed-edom.</span>--Added by the chronicler, in harmony with what he has stated about the custody of the sacred treasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-15.htm" title="To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.">1Chronicles 26:15</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>); but probably derived from an ancient document. Obededom was the name of a Levitical clan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - No mention is made in the parallel of that custodian of treasures in the house of God, here called Obed-Edom, and who possibly was a descendant of the Obed-Edom of David's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-13.htm">1 Chronicles 13:13</a>); or an Obed-Edom "a porter" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>, S). The present verse is an interesting one for pointing out the exact differences, even to the minutest of them, in what the two writers (of Kings and Chronicles) respectively took from a common original; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the writer of Kings has "he took;" leaves out "<span class="accented">Obed-Edom</span>;" has not the preposition "<span class="accented">in"</span> before "the house;" has "Jehovah" instead of "God;" has the preposition "<span class="accented">in"</span> before "<span class="accented">treasures</span>;" and has "Samaria<span class="accented">-ward"</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Samaria) instead of only "Samaria;" the writer of Chronicles differing in each of these respects. <span class="cmt_word">All the gold... in the house of God.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17, 18</a>, from which we must conclude that Hazael had already had the pick both for quantity and for quality. The hostages also; the phrase runs in the Hebrew text, "and sons [or, 'the sons'] of the hostages" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>); the literal rendering of which is "children or <span class="accented">sons</span> of <span class="accented">pledges</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">hostages.</span> The word (and indeed the practice <span class="accented">so</span> prevalent elsewhere) is found only here and in the parallel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:17-28 Never was a proud prince more thoroughly mortified than Amaziah by Joash king of Israel. A man's pride will bring him low, Pr 29:23; it goes before his destruction, and deservedly brings it on. He that exalteth himself shall be abased. He that goes forth hastily to strive, will not know what he shall do in the end thereof, when his neighbour has put him to shame, Pr 25:8. And what are we when we offer to establish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves before the Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselves stately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not every corruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on the wretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust? A man's pride shall bring him low; his ruin may be dated from his turning from the Lord.</body></html>
