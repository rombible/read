The next verse tells us that "all the children of Ephraim" (which was strictly the northern Israel's chief tribe) are hereby designated. It is not quite clear that this Israel is exactly conterminous with the Israel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>, the identity of which, however, with Joab's Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) is very probable. The boundaries of the strict tribe of Ephraim, whose ancestor was Joseph's younger son, are described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>. The tribe were located as nearly as possible in the centre of the land. Ephraim, however, is here, as in many other places, as the name of the royal tribe, so named upon the whole of the northern kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-3.htm">Isaiah 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>; <span class="accented">several times in almost every chapter of Hosea, and for a typical instance</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-8.htm">Hosea 14:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-13 Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.</body></html>
