The reference to Joash is omitted, perhaps because that king appears to less advantage in the Chronicles than ill Kings. In fact, the chronicler's estimate of both princes is less favourable than that of the older historian. Such differences are perfectly natural, and it is needless to attempt to "reconcile" or eliminate them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and five years old...</span> <span class="cmt_word">reigned twenty and nine years.</span> Glance at notes on vers. 1, 15, 17 of foregoing chapter, from which it appears that, as Joash died <span class="accented">aetat.</span> forty-seven, and Amaziah was now twenty-five, he must have been born when his father was twenty-two years old, and <span class="cmt_word">Jehoaddan</span> correspondingly likely to have been one of the two wives Jehoiada selected for Joash, at the age, on <span class="accented">other</span> data, of twenty-one years. <span class="cmt_word">Of Jerusalem</span>. This affix to the mother's name may perhaps carry credit to the memory of Jehoiada, for having been careful to select a woman of the honoured city rather than of any provincial or even less worthy city. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-13 Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.</body></html>
