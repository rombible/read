Esarhaddon states that he restored the gods of Hazael, king of Arabia, at that prince's entreaty, after engraving on them "the might of Asshur" and his own name. Assurbanipal recovered an image of Nana, which an Elamite sovereign had carried off one thousand six hundred and thirty-five years previously.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Seir.</span>--<span class= "ital">Bne Seir,</span> the tribal designation of the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-38.htm" title="And the sons of Seir; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, and Dishon, and Ezar, and Dishan.">1Chronicles 1:38</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Set them up to be his gods.</span>--Not necessarily abandoning the worship of Jehovah. (Comp. the conduct of Ahaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-23.htm" title="For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.">2Chronicles 28:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/17-27.htm" title="Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.">2Kings 17:27-33</a>.) Thenius says this contradicts <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-3.htm" title="And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.">2Kings 14:3</a>; and it may be allowed that the chronicler portrays Amaziah in a darker light than the older account. This only proves independence of judgment and the possession of additional information. Thenius and Bertheau further suppose that the chronicler, from his theocratic standpoint, merely <span class= "ital">inferred</span> the idolatry of Amaziah from his ill success against Israel. It is more likely that it was mentioned in one of the histories which the compiler had before him.<p><span class= "bld">Bowed down himself.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And before them would he bow himself, and to them would he offer incense;</span> relating his habitual practice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brought the gods of the children</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Seir... to be his gods.</span> Amaziah's devout gratitude to God, and acknowledgment of him in the name Joktheel, was soon gone, and at the very last, grown confident, he loses all, and realizes the fulfilment of the "man of God's" prophetic denunciations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:14-16 To worship the gods of those whom Amaziah had conquered, who could not help their own worshippers, was the greatest absurdity. If men would consider how unable all those things are to help them, to which they look whenever they forsake God, they would not be such enemies to themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be answered; themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be answered; but he was bidden not to say a word more. The secure sinner rejoices to have silenced his reprovers and monitors; but what comes of it? Those that are deaf to reproof, are ripening for destruction.</body></html>
