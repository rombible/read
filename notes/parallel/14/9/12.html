If the reading be sound, we may understand <span class= "ital">return presents, i.e.,</span> gifts equal in value to those which she had bestowed.

Putting the clause first would make this meaning clearer: "And quite apart from what she brought the king, Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire."

LXX. translates, "besides all that she brought to king Solomon;" the Vulg., "and far more than she had brought him," which <span class= "ital">may</span> be a trace of the original reading; the Syriac, "besides what he had given her." Syriac and Arabic add, "and he revealed to her all that was in her heart."<p><span class= "bld">She turned.</span>--<span class= "ital">H?phak,</span> for <span class= "ital">p?n?h</span> of Kings, which is more usual in this sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside that which she had brought unto the king</span>. The parallel has not this obscure clause, but has, "beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal Bounty." Professor Dr. Murphy explains our clause as purporting to say this: Solomon gave all the queen's desire in the way of bounty, "beside" all that belonged as an equivalent for "what she had brought." She got so much sheer gift, beside all that, according to the then Eastern custom, was her due. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 This history has been considered, 1Ki 10; yet because our Saviour has proposed it as an example in seeking after him, Mt 12:42, we must not pass it over without observing, that those who know the worth of true wisdom will grudge no pains or cost to obtain it. The queen of Sheba put herself to a great deal of trouble and expense to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and yet, learning from him to serve God, and do her duty, she thought herself well paid for her pains. Heavenly wisdom is that pearl of great price, for which, if we part with all, we make a good bargain.</body></html>
