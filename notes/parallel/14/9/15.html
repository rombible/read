The Authorized Version "target" is unfortunate, though it may with somewhat grim truth represent fact. It was a very large solid shield, originally made of some common material, as basketwork or wood, and covered with leather; <span class="accented">these</span> with a plate of gold. The absence of the word "shekel" in each clause, both here and in Kings, leaves it open to us to suppose that the <span class="accented">beka</span>, or <span class="accented">half-</span>shekel, may be the right word. Now, the <span class="accented">maneh</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>), or pound, meant 100 bekas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 50 shekels. Thus the targets, or shields, had six manehs of gold to their plating each, and the lesser <span class="accented">bucklers</span> (as we may perhaps call them) three manehs each. On the estimate that the shekel weighed 9 dwt. 3 gr., since the maneh weighed fifty shekels (100 <span class="accented">bekas</span>, or half-shekels), the gold to a shield (target) may be put at something over 11 lbs. troy. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the forest of Lebanon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an armoury (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>).

True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</body></html>
