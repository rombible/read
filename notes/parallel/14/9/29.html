The present quotation of the name of Ahijah in connection with his work, and the brief allusion to himself in our <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-15.htm">2 Chronicles 10:15</a>, are the only appearances of Ahijah in Chronicles. He and the importance of his work are clear enough from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-1.htm">1 Kings 14:1-20</a>. As the compiler of Chronicles evidently by a law omits any even reference to the defection of Solomon, it is natural that the name and special ministry of Ahijah should fall into the shade with him. Uniformly it is observable in Chronicles that the <span class="accented">personal</span> is not enlarged upon where it is not directly and indispensably ancillary to the ecclesiastical and national history. On the other hand, the writer of Kings does not once mention <span class="accented">Iddo</span> the seer, whereas we read of him again twice in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-31 The imports here mentioned, would show that prosperity drew the minds of Solomon and his subjects to the love of things curious and uncommon, though useless in themselves. True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</body></html>
