The LXX., Syr., and Vulg. here agree with Kings; and the Arab. reads, "the altar on which he offered." In all other passages, the word used in our text (<span class= "ital">'aliy?h</span>) means not <span class= "ital">ascent,</span> but <span class= "ital">upper chamber;</span> it is likely, therefore, that in the present instance it is merely an error of transcription for the term occurring in Kings (<span class= "ital">'ol?h,</span> "burnt-offering").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> meat of his table (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>). Translating our thoughts rather violently into modern language, we might picture the queen inspecting the <span class="accented">kitchens</span> of the palace, and remember that the kitchens of an Oriental court did the work, not of an individual "table," but of those of a very large domestic and official retinue; much more these of Solomon now. Keil and Bertheau, however, with others, refer this expression to the set-out of one meal-table (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that of a modern banquet, wedding breakfast, or the like), where both the abounding lading of the table and the ample variety of the courses, and the rich foreign or home fruits, in season or out of season, and the furnishing and decorating of the table, all come in to add their contribution of effect; and they quote not inaptly our ver. 20, elucidated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>. This was a daily glory with Solomon's palace-establishment. The immediate connection and the contents of this verse, though difficult, favour this direction of explanation, as will be seen in the succeeding clauses. <span class="cmt_word">The sitting of his servants</span>. The word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) occurs forty-three times, and is rendered in the Authorized Version thirty-two of these times as "habitation" or "dwelling." Of the remaining eleven times, one or other of those words would be almost the synonym of the word used, and in every ease the rendering "dwelling," if kept to the general idea of a dwelling or resting-place more or less <span class="accented">temporary</span>, would not be inappropriate or inconsistent with the evident drift of the connection; only here and in the parallel is the inconvenient rendering "sitting" adopted by the Authorized Version. Hence we disagree with Professor Dr. Murphy's explanation, <span class="accented">the sitting, i.e.</span> "in council of his chief officers." What the nature of the <span class="accented">location</span> (to use a term least specific) of the servants pointed to here is, nevertheless, still not quite clear. It is evidently placed in some antithesis with the <span class="accented">standing</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the standing-place) here rendered 'inadequately or incorrectly, <span class="cmt_word">the attendance of his ministers</span>. <span class="accented">The attendance, i.e.</span> "the station (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>) (see the four other occurrences of this' word: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>). <span class="accented">Of his ministers</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, participle of a piel verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>. This word, in an amazing majority of the hundred occurrences of it, expresses ministry of <span class="accented">sacred</span> service of some kind. It may, indeed, be said that the present passage, with only one or two others, are doubtful in this meaning or character of explanation. To our next clause, referring to <span class="cmt_word">their apparel</span>, we find in the parallel mention, as here, of the <span class="cmt_word">cupbearers</span>, though the matter of <span class="accented">their</span> apparel is not included as it is here. Part of the difficulty of the verse arises from the consideration that up to this point the contents of the successive clauses of it may compose possibly enough a sharp graphic description of the daily banquet scene. An apt reference to similar description of Arabian banquets is given in the 'Speaker's Commentary ' as to be found in vol. it. pp. 213-215 of 'Ancient Monarchies.' Our next clause, however, brings us back into difficulty by its reference to Solomon's <span class="cmt_word">ascent</span> by <span class="cmt_word">which he went up into the house of the Lord</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> with our Exposition, 'Pulpit Commentary'), apparently so unseasonably; nor are we much helped by reading, with the Septuagint, "the burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the Lord." The obscurity and lack of coherence are not formidable, indeed, and perhaps may be with moderate satisfaction set down again to the account of the occasionally careless selection of the compilers from the material of the older work. Possibly the allusion in our ver. 11 to the <span class="accented">terraces</span>, or stairs, or highways (see margin) to "the house of the Lord," <span class="accented">and to the king's palace</span>, may hold some clue to the <span class="accented">ascent</span> being adverted to here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 This history has been considered, 1Ki 10; yet because our Saviour has proposed it as an example in seeking after him, Mt 12:42, we must not pass it over without observing, that those who know the worth of true wisdom will grudge no pains or cost to obtain it. The queen of Sheba put herself to a great deal of trouble and expense to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and yet, learning from him to serve God, and do her duty, she thought herself well paid for her pains. Heavenly wisdom is that pearl of great price, for which, if we part with all, we make a good bargain.</body></html>
