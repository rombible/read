The chronicler has made an explanatory addition. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-29.htm" title="And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for till now the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.">1Chronicles 12:29</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-18.htm" title="For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one">2Chronicles 30:18</a>, for the word <span class= "ital">marbith,</span> "increase," "multitude," which occurs thrice in the Chronicles and twice elsewhere.)<p><span class= "bld">Thou exceedest the fame.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Thou kast added to the report.</span> Kings, more fully, "Thou hast added wisdom and weal to the report."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 This history has been considered, 1Ki 10; yet because our Saviour has proposed it as an example in seeking after him, Mt 12:42, we must not pass it over without observing, that those who know the worth of true wisdom will grudge no pains or cost to obtain it. The queen of Sheba put herself to a great deal of trouble and expense to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and yet, learning from him to serve God, and do her duty, she thought herself well paid for her pains. Heavenly wisdom is that pearl of great price, for which, if we part with all, we make a good bargain.</body></html>
