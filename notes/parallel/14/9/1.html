Sheba</span>. This was the name of a descendant of Cush, a Hamite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); also of a son of Joktan, a Shemite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-22.htm">1 Chronicles 1:22</a>); also of a son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>). It is quite uncertain who of these constituted, or preponderated in, the country of Sheba here referred to. This is probably Saba, the capital of Yemen, an important province of Arabia, west of the Red Sea, north of the Indian Ocean, and extending upward nearly to Idumaea. The city was reputed splendid, the country wealthy, and long as the most southerly inhabited part of the world. If it were, as is believed, first occupied by Cushites it was afterwards peopled also by Joktanites and Jokahanites, as above. In addition- to the two celebrated allusions to it, ever memorable, see as other references, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-31.htm">Luke 11:31</a> (see also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1232). The hard questions consisted in riddles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-2.htm">Judges 14:2</a>) and enigmas and primitive casuistry, in which the Arabians found some considerable portion of their mental gymnastics These, no doubt, bore some mild cousinly relationship to the proverbs and songs of Solomon, and his treasures of botanical and natural history facts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Spices</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, here as also in the parallel.
