In the Mishna '<span class= "ital">alm-g</span> is "coral;" and the Rabbis ascribe a <span class= "ital">red</span> colour to the algum wood. The <span class= "ital">Pterocarpus Santalinus</span> has blood-red wood with black streaks, is fragrant, and is used in works of art, as well as for burning. The tree called <span class= "ital">Valgu</span> or <span class= "ital">Valgum</span> is the <span class= "ital">Santalum album,</span> which produces <span class= "ital">white</span> and <span class= "ital">yellow</span> sandalwood. Thenius doubts whether the algum wood of Solomon was not the teak (<span class= "ital">Cytharexylon Tectona</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> which abounds in East India, and is a hard, yellow-streaked, strongly-scented wood, used in India for temple building.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - Either these two verses are misplaced (with their parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11, 12</a>), or they ought to have, though unstated, some occult bearing on the queen. There are some slight indications pointing to this, and the meaning is perhaps that the terraces, balustrades, stairs (which possibly is the idea in the "ascent," ver. 4), pillars, etc., made of the wood which Hiram's and Solomon's servants had <span class="accented">formerly</span> brought with gold, were the artificial-work wonders which helped to astound the queen. <span class="cmt_word">Terraces to the house of the Lord, and to the king's palace</span>. These so rendered <span class="accented">terraces</span> were probably stairs, and, as already intimated, may have composed the "ascent" (ver. 4), and explain the mention of it in ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The algum trees.</span> This is the Hebrew text order of the <span class="accented">lamed</span> and <span class="accented">gimel</span> alphabet characters, as the Authorized Version order in the parallel <span class="accented">almug</span> is also the order of its Hebrew. The tree is mentioned only six times - three times in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10, 11</a>) and three times in Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11, 12</a>). Apparently this wood did grow in Lebanon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>), though we think this not certain. Kimchi thinks it was the bukkum (Arabic word), which Europeans call Brazil wood, and which (Keil) was found in Ethiopia, as well as India. Some think it the sandal-wood of Malabar. Whatever it was, it no doubt was to be purchased at the emporium of Ophir. The intrinsic nature of the wood, and its intrinsically valuable nature, may easily be inferred from its use for the woodwork and sounding-board woodwork of musical instruments like the <span class="accented">harp</span> and <span class="accented">psaltery.</span> This fact would much incline to the view that the <span class="accented">red</span> sandal-wood is what is here called algum. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes Max Muller ('Lectures on Language,' 1st series, p. 191) for the statement that the vernacular for this wood in India is <span class="accented">valguka</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Harps... psalteries</span> (see our Exposition on 2 Chronicles 5:12, and articles in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and others.
