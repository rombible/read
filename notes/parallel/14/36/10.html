"At the return of the year" means in spring, when kings usually went forth to war. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah.

Kings gives a full account of the siege and surrender of Jerusalem, and the deportation to Babylon of the king and all his princes and men of war, by "the servants of Nebuchadnezzar."<p><span class= "bld">With the goodly vessels.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm" title="And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;">2Chronicles 32:27</a>. "Some of the vessels" had already been carried off (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.">2Chronicles 36:7</a>). (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm" title="And he carried out there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.">2Kings 24:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/27-18.htm" title="But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.">Jeremiah 27:18-22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Zedekiah his brother.</span>--Zedekiah was <span class= "ital">uncle</span> of Jehoiachin, being a son of Josiah, and brother of Jehoiakim. Perhaps "brother" is equivalent to "kinsman" here, as elsewhere. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a>, where Zedekiah appears as a son of Josiah; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a>.) The versions read "his father's brother"--a correction. Thenius thinks the word for "uncle" had become illegible in the MS. here used by the chronicler.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the year was expired</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the beginning of the new year, in spring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>). It appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27-30</a>, that the captivity of Jehoia-chin, which thus began, lasted thirty-seven years, till <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, past the end of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and that he was thenceforward kindly treated by Evil-Merodach. Compare particularly with this verse the parallel in its vers. 10-16. <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah his brother</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not adopting the very generic usage of the terms of relationship, so common in Old Testament language, his <span class="accented">uncle</span>. His mother (<span class="accented">Hamutal, ver.</span> 18 of parallel) was the same with the mother of Jehoahaz. Ten years old evidently when Jehoiakim began his reign, he must have been thirteen years younger than his whole brother Je-hoahaz. Zedekiah's name was before Mat-taniah. The account of Zedekiah in the parallel (which see) is very much more full. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-21 The ruin of Judah and Jerusalem came on by degrees. The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.</body></html>
