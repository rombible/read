Our mere allusions in this and the following verse to Nebuchadnezzar's relations to Jehoiakim and Judah are strange in comparison with the graphic account furnished by the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-6</a>). The name is the same with <span class="accented">Nabokodrosoros</span>, is written in the Assyrian monuments <span class="accented">Nebu-kuduri-utzur</span>, and meaning, "Nebo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), protector from ill," or "protects the crown." In Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>) we have the name written Nebuchadrezzar, as also in Ezekiel. Nebuchadnezzar, second King of Babylon, was the son of Nabopolassar, who took Nineveh <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>, and reigned above forty years. Though we are here told he bound Jehoiakim in chains, to take him to Babylon, for some reason or other he did not carry out this intention, and Jehoiakim was put to death at Jerusalem (Jeremiah 12:18, 19; Jeremiah 36:30; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-8.htm">Ezekiel 19:8, 9</a>). The expedition of Nebuchadnezzar was <span class="date">B.C. 605-4</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a>), and <span class="accented">during</span> it, his father dying, he succeeded to the throne. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-21 The ruin of Judah and Jerusalem came on by degrees. The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.</body></html>
