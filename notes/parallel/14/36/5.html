Schrader gives a short inscription from a brick now in the Zrich Museum. "Nab--Kudurri-ucur, king of Babylon, restorer of Esagili and Ezida [two famous temples], son of Nab--abala-ucur, King of Babylon am I." No really historical inscription is known except a fragment relating to his Egyptian campaign in his 37th year (568 B.C. ), and an illegible one on the rocks of <span class= "ital">Nahr-el-Kelb</span> near Beirut. The LXX. here interpolates the account of Jehoiakim's three years of vassalage, and his revolt against Nebuchadnezzar, and the other events and reflections contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/24-1.htm" title="In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.">2Kings 24:1-4</a>. The LXX. makes Jehoiakim, instead of Manasseh, "fill Jerusalem with innocent blood," contrary to the Hebrew text.<p><span class= "bld">And bound him in fetters.</span>--<span class= "ital">Two bronze</span> (<span class= "ital">chains</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm" title="Why the LORD brought on them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.">2Chronicles 33:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To carry him to Babylon.</span>--To <span class= "ital">make him go.</span> It is not said that this intention was carried out. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm" title="Why the LORD brought on them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.">2Chronicles 33:11</a>, "and carried him to Babylon.") Nebuchadnezzar, who, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm" title="Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.">Jeremiah 46:2</a>, had defeated Necho in a great battle at Carchemish, in the 4th year of Jehoiakim, appears to have left the king of Judah to reign as a vassal-king, after inflicting upon him a severe humiliation. (The LXX., 3 Esdr., Vulg., and Arabic, but not the Syriac, read: "and carried him to Babylon.") Thenius says this must be the right reading, and then denies its claim to credibility. He further <span class= "ital">asserts</span> that, "in order to allow ample scope for the fulfilment of the prophecy of Jeremiah" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-8.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.">2Chronicles 36:8</a>), the chronicler has represented Jehoiakim as carried alive to Babylon in the last year of his reign. This statement rests not upon <span class= "ital">objective</span> historical grounds, but upon <span class= "ital">subjective</span> prejudices against the chronicler.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a>, by a transcriber's error, puts this first capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in the <span class= "ital">third</span> year of Jehoiakim; whereas Nebuchadnezzar only became king in the fourth of Jehoiakim. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm" title="And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:">2Kings 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;">Jeremiah 25:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Here we note the age of Jehoiakim as greater than that of Jeoahaz, and in the parallel we read that his mother was different. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-21 The ruin of Judah and Jerusalem came on by degrees. The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.</body></html>
