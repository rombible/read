A period of half a century has elapsed between the latest date of the foregoing verses (circ. <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>) and the date signalized here (circ. <span class="date">B.C. 5</span>.38-6). With the proclamation of <span class="accented">Cyrus</span> begins in fact the manhood, with all its mystic, its wonderful, and its still non-progressing struggles, of the Jew. His simple childhood, wilful youth, am indeed for ever gone. But he and his nation are with unspeakably painful travail born. No life of nation that is or ever has been merits the devout observation and study that this unchal-lengeably does. Our present verse and the one succeeding it are, sentence for sentence, the same with the opening verses of the Book of Ezra, which may possibly once have joined on to Chronicles, as one work, though we think this exceedingly unlikely. Cyrus (the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> of the Hebrew text) was the son of a royal Persian, Cambysses; his mother was Mandane, daughter of Astyages, last King of Media. The name appears on the monuments, written <span class="accented">Kurus.</span> Cyrus defeated his grandfather Astyages, <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>; ending thereby the Median royal line; and he defeated Croesus, <span class="date">B.C. 546</span>, possessing himself thereby of the kingdom of Lydia; he took Babylon, as above, <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. He himself died in battle, <span class="date">B.C. 529</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord by... Jeremiah might be accomplished</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-9.htm">Jeremiah 29:9-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus</span>. The fact is told us, and this, no doubt, as on a thousand other unsuspected occasions of far more intrinsic and vital interest in the Bible, is sufficient. It would have been interesting to know, however, even here, the mode in which Cyrus was appealed to; as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, it has been plausibly suggested that Daniel may have been in part instrumental in the work, and that, again, in part perhaps by directing the attention of Cyrus to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:22,23 God had promised the restoring of the captives, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, at the end of seventy years; and that time to favour Zion, that set time, came at last. Though God's church be cast down, it is not cast off; though his people be corrected, they are not abandoned; though thrown into the furnace, they are not lost there, nor left there any longer than till the dross be separated. Though God contend long, he will not contend always. Before we close the books of the Chronicles, which contain a faithful register of events, think what desolation sin introduced into the world, nay, even into the church of God. Let us tremble at what is here recorded, while in the character of some few gracious souls, we discover that the Lord left not himself without witness. And when we have looked at this faithful portrait of man by nature, let us contrast with it that same nature, when recovered by Almighty grace, through the justifying and soul-adorning righteousness of Christ our Saviour.</body></html>
