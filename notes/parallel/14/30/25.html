(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-12.htm" title="Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojournes among you eat blood.">Leviticus 17:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The strangers</span>. Some consider this describes "proselytes from Israel, who were non-Israelites." But this seems a most gratuitous supposition. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> does, in fact, purport only "sojourners," and is frequently so translated, and our next clause corroborates this view. The interesting aspect of it is, that probably the persons described had emigrated from their own tribes, as they longed for Jerusalem, "their chief joy." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:21-27 Many prayers were put up to God with the peace-offerings. In these Israel looked to God as the God of their fathers, a God in covenant with them. There was also abundance of good preaching. The Levites read and explained the Scriptures. Faith cometh by hearing, and true religion preaching has abounded. They sang psalms every day: praising God should be much of our work in religious assemblies. Having kept the seven days of the feast in this religious manner, they had so much comfort in it, that they kept other seven days also. This they did with gladness. Holy duties should be done with holy gladness. And when sinners humble themselves before the Lord, they may expect gladness in his ordinances. Those who taste this happiness will not soon grow weary of it, but will be glad to prolong their enjoyment.</body></html>
