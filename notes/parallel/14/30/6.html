The words are a rhetorical reference to Tiglath-pileser's invasion of the northern kingdom, and the depopulation of Galilee and Gilead. The chronicler's language may have been influenced also by recollection of the last fatal inroad of Shalmaneser II., in the fourth year of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.">2Kings 18:9</a>).

Hezekiah had, no doubt, already made his account with the fact that the injured and crushed state of the northern kingdom might be of salutary omen for the attempt on his part to bring them to a sense of their past sins, specially perhaps of omission. Of the calamities of Israel, and their captivity in large part, and in the rest subjection by tribute to Assyria, there is clear testimony in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-1.htm">2 Kings 17:1-6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-12 Hezekiah made Israel as welcome to the passover, as any of his own subjects. Let us yield ourselves unto the Lord. Say not, you will do what you please, but resolve to do what he pleases. We perceive in the carnal mind a stiffness, an obstinacy, an unaptness to compel with God; we have it from our fathers: this must be overcome. Those who, through grace, have turned to God themselves, should do all they can to bring others to him. Numbers will be scorners, but some will be humbled and benefited; perhaps where least expected. The rich mercy of God is the great argument by which to enforce repentance; the vilest who submit and yield themselves to the Lord, seek his grace, and give themselves to his service, shall certainly be saved. Oh that messengers were sent forth to carry these glad tidings to every city and every village, through every land!</body></html>
