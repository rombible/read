Joash the king's son.</span> This latter person is found only here and in the parallel, and the designation given him probably does not intend a personal relationship to the king, but an official; so see again <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-7.htm">2 Chronicles 28:7</a>; and note the conjunction again of the governor of the house, in the next clause. The Vulgate translates the Hebrew for "the king's," as though it were a proper name, "Amelech." See also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' under the name "Maaseiah" 17. Nor is <span class="accented">Amon</span> <span class="accented">the governor</span> known elsewhere except in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>), but these designations, as through some chinks, throw a little scanty light into the subject of the internal administration at this time of the kingdom of Israel. In this kingdom subsequent to the separation, decentralization seems to have been carried to a further point than in Judah, and considering its greater extent, its far inferior metropolitan force, its double place of worship and sacrifice, these largely idolatrous, and in all this the undoubted degraded authority of its central government, this is very explainable. It is true that in both kingdoms history speaks equally of such offices and officers as were distinctly military or looked that way, but it can scarcely be without a reason that for the numerous allusions in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-7.htm">1 Kings 21:7-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-6.htm">2 Kings 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>) to councils of elders (well known before the disruption), and governors of palaces, of cities, of houses, and of provinces, there is scarcely one in the records of Judah. Here possibly enough the executive would be more vigorous, more compact, and more direct and close in its action from headquarters, while in both divisions of what should have been the one kingdom, royalty was by profession constitutional, and in its devolution hereditary. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-34 Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahab. - This history we read in 1Ki 22. Abundant riches and honour give large opportunities of doing good, but they are attended with many snares and temptations. Men do not know much of the artifices of Satan and the deceitfulness of their own hearts, when they covet riches with the idea of being able to do good with them. What can hurt those whom God will protect? What can shelter those whom God will destroy? Jehoshaphat is safe in his robes, Ahab killed in his armour; for the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. We should be cautious of entangling ourselves in the worldly undertakings of evil men; and still more we should avoid engaging in their sinful projects. But, when they call upon him, God can and will bring his faithful people out of the difficulties and dangers into which they have sinfully run themselves. He has all hearts in his hand, so that he easily rescues them. Blessed is the man that putteth his trust in the Lord.</body></html>
