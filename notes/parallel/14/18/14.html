This rather reminds us of the Delphic oracle: "If Cr?sus pass the Halys, a mighty empire will be overthrown," though the words of Zedekiah in the preceding verse are plain enough.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - This first reply of Micaiah, given in the latter haft of the verse, does not stand for untruth or deceit, but for very thinly veiled, very thinly disguised, very keen taunt and reproof. It has been well described as the ironical echo of the language of the unreal prophets. Micaiah begins by answering a fool according to his folly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to his own heart's desire. He had just come from some place of imprisonment or punishment (ver. 25). And he so spoke or so looked that the king should know he had not spoken his last word in answer to the inquiry addressed to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-34 Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahab. - This history we read in 1Ki 22. Abundant riches and honour give large opportunities of doing good, but they are attended with many snares and temptations. Men do not know much of the artifices of Satan and the deceitfulness of their own hearts, when they covet riches with the idea of being able to do good with them. What can hurt those whom God will protect? What can shelter those whom God will destroy? Jehoshaphat is safe in his robes, Ahab killed in his armour; for the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. We should be cautious of entangling ourselves in the worldly undertakings of evil men; and still more we should avoid engaging in their sinful projects. But, when they call upon him, God can and will bring his faithful people out of the difficulties and dangers into which they have sinfully run themselves. He has all hearts in his hand, so that he easily rescues them. Blessed is the man that putteth his trust in the Lord.</body></html>
