The Authorised version suggests another mode of emending the text.

This view can hardly be pressed. The very word "wherefore" in ver. 3 goes far to discredit it. And any difference that may be apparent in the language is far more probably and easily attributable to the old cause of the narrower, though intenser, interest of the writer of Chronicles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence of God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for. When Christ is formed in a soul, the law written in the heart, the ark of the covenant settled there, so that it becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction in that soul.</body></html>
