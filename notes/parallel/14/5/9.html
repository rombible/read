This is no doubt right. A letter has fallen out of the Hebrew text. That the chronicler has preserved this remark without modification to suit altered circumstances, and indeed that the compiler of Kings did the same long before him, is a striking instance of the way in which Oriental historiographers are content to borrow with literal exactitude from the works of predecessors, even in cases where such borrowing appears to the modern mind infelicitous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They drew out</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the staves projected.

The words, "from the ark," are here probably by misposition, and should follow the words, <span class="cmt_word">the staves projected</span>; while the parallel tells us what should be in their place here, namely, "from the holy place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>). The confusion and omission will merely lie with some copyists, for five manuscripts show the words "from the holy place." There it is unto this day. The parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>)reads, "<span class="cmt_word">there they are unto this day</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the staves. In either case, whether the ark or the staves were spoken of, the memorandum is exceedingly interesting and noteworthy, as a patent bare copy of an old record dating before the destruction of the temple, on the part of whether the writer of Kings or Chronicles. Plainly the historian touches ground, and shows us that <span class="accented">we</span> do also; for it is evident that, far from cunningly devised fable, he has before him in either case an <span class="accented">original</span> document. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence of God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for. When Christ is formed in a soul, the law written in the heart, the ark of the covenant settled there, so that it becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction in that soul.</body></html>
