The temple-building, which had been commenced in Solomon's fourth year, had occupied seven years in construction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>), but another thirteen years in furnishing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1, 2</a>). The record of Chronicles is, of course, in some respects somewhat more sketchy than that of Kings; and the correct view of the chronology has in both writers to be sought and read between the lines. It was when the house and "all the work designed for the house of the Lord was finished," that (ver. 2) "Solomon assembled the elders," etc., and arranged for the solemn dedication; that is, when four years of his reign, and seven years of building and thirteen years of furnishing, etc., had elapsed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence of God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for. When Christ is formed in a soul, the law written in the heart, the ark of the covenant settled there, so that it becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction in that soul.</body></html>
