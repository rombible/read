This city is nowhere else called Abel-maim, which is, per haps, an early mistake.

Cinneroth is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-35.htm" title="And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,">Joshua 19:35</a>) as a town of Naphtali, and the Sea of Galilee was called the Sea of Cinneroth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-3.htm" title="And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:">Joshua 12:3</a>). Probably the fertile district west of the lake was also called Cinneroth, and this was the country which Benhadad's army laid waste. The present reading of Chronicles may be either a mere textual corruption, or a paraphrase of that of Kings. Some critics assume its originality, which is less likely. We prefer to regard it as a paraphrase or explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Benhadad was apparently not very long in making up either his mind or his method. The bribe that tempted him, drawn from "the treasures" described, well replenished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-18.htm">2 Chronicles 15:18</a>; and parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>), was probably large. His method was to create a diversion in favour of his new ally, by "smiting" certain picked and highly important cities of Israel, mostly in northern Galilee, by name "Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtalli." <span class="cmt_word">Ijon</span>. In Naphtali, mentioned only now, in the parallel, and when a second time taken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) by Tiglath-Pileser. <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span>. The colonizing of this city is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1, 2, 29-31</a>; it was originally called Laish, and became the northern landmark of the whole country, as in the expression, "from Dan even to Beersheba" (Judges 17:29; 20:1). <span class="cmt_word">Abel-maim</span>. This place was situate at the foot of the Lebanon; in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>) it is called Abel-beth-maachah. It is again mentioned as attacked by Tiglath-Pileser, who wrested it from Pekah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18, 14, 15</a> it is called Abel by itself, but in the last two of these verses Beth-maachah is mentioned in close connection with it. After this name the parallel gives also "all Cinneroth" (Septuagint, "all the land of Cinnereth"). The name is the original of the New Testament <span class="accented">Gennesaret</span>. It was a city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>) that gave its name to the sea and western region of the lake, sometimes called so (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>). If there were a little more external evidence of it, we should incline to the opinion of Movers, that the "all Cinneroth" of the parallel is the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">"</span>all the store-cities") of our present verse. But at present we may take it that the two records supplement one another. <span class="cmt_word">All the store-cities of Naphtali</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-6.htm">2 Chronicles 8:6</a> and its parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
