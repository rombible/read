The burning of aromatic woods and spices was usual at the obsequies of kings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases.

Asa's distinction as a wealthy and powerful monarch, and the high esteem with which his subjects regarded him, are indicated by the extraordinary amount of spices burnt in his honour. There is no ground for supposing that the chronicler blames "the exaggerated splendour and lavish excess with which this custom was observed at the burial of Asa, as if it were the burial of an Egyptian Pharaoh" (<span class= "ital">Z�ckler</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> His account of the splendour of Solomon proves that he delighted to dwell on the glory of the ancient kings of his people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his own sepulchres</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>; fem. plur. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>. The plural designates, of course, the range of burial compartments that formed the tomb of one person or family. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm">Job 17:1</a>, where the masc. plur. is used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In the city of David</span> (see note on 2 Chronicles 12:16). <span class="cmt_word">In the bed</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>. The use or associations of this word (found about fifty times) are almost entirely, if not entirely, those of the bed of nightly rest, even when not at the time speaking of nightly rest; and this is the first and only occasion that it is employed to link the grave in kindly analogy with the couch of bodily repose during lifetime. The fact might have suggested Bishop Ken's lines in the evening hymn - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"<span class="accented">Teach me to live, that I may dread<br />The grave as little as my bed."</span> In the present instance, however, the writer, whoever he was (query, was he the compiler of our Chronicles, or his original?), is doubt-leas led to the analogy by considerations mere earthly than those enshrined in Ken's hymn, viz. by the somewhat "vain show" of attractiveness and fragrance (probably designed partly for preservative purposes) with which the place was filled, and which were among even patriarchal indications of faith in a future state. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet odours</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Of the twenty-nine times that this word occurs in Exodus, Kings, and Chronicles, Esther, Canticles, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, it is rendered in the Authorized Vermon "spices" twenty-four times, "sweet cinnamon" once, "sweet calamus" once, and "sweet odours" or "sweet smell" three times. The chief and determining references are those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-8.htm">Exodus 35:8, 28</a>.

God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
