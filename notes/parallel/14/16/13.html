(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm" title="And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.">1Kings 15:10</a>, "And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Amid the frequent uncertainties of the chronology, we are glad to get some dates fixed by the agreement of testimonies. <span class="accented">E.g.</span> this place and the parallel state clearly that Asa's reign was one that lasted to its forty-first year. The parallel, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>), makes this date one and the same thing with his "old age<span class="accented"></span>," while no manipulation of dates can make him (the grandson of Rehoboam and son of Abijah) more than about fifty. And it is somewhat remarkable that, when introduced to us as succeeding to the throne, nothing is said of his tender youth (as, for instance, is said in the case of Josiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-3</a>). Nevertheless, the apparent prominence of Maachah awhile would tally with the circumstance of Asa's youth at his accession. Another correspondence in Josiah's career is noticeable; for it is distinctly said that when he was only twelve years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>) "he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places," etc. At a similarly youthful age Asa, therefore, may be credited with doing the like, while later on he took more stringent measures, as for instance with Maachah, the queen-mother. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
