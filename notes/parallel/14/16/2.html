In the first clause Kings reads: "And Asa took <span class= "ital">all the silver and the gold that were</span> <span class= "ital">left</span> in the treasures of the house of the Lord." The chronicler has purposely weakened this statement. He has also omitted the pedigree of Benhahad ("<span class= "ital">ben Ta- brimmon ben Hezyon"</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and written the Aramaizing form <span class= "ital">Darmeseq</span> for <span class= "ital">Dammeseg.</span> (Syriac, <span class= "ital">Darm?s-q.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The writer of Chronicles omits the pedigree of this <span class="cmt_word">Benhadad King of Syria</span>, given in the parallel "the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion." Benhidri is the name of Benhadad in the Assyrian monuments. The Septuagint gives Ader, which tallies with it, For <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span>, we have here <span class="accented">Dar-mesek</span>, instead of the more usual <span class="accented">Dammesek</span> of the parallel and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>; the <span class="accented">resh</span> representing (as in Syriac) the dagesh forte in <span class="accented">men.</span> The parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>) says that Asa took all the silver and the gold left in the treasures, etc.; but the reading "left" should very possibly (see Septuagint Version) be "found," the Hebrew characters easily permitting it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
