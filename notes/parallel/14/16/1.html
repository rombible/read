<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-8.htm" title="In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.">1Kings 16:8</a>, Baasha began to reign in the third year of Asa, reigned twenty-four years, and died in the twenty-sixth year of Asa. These statements are obviously irreconcilable with that of our verse. We must suppose either that the chronicler has accepted a different calculation from that of the Kings--a calculation which he may have found in one of his documents; or that the text here is unsound, and thirty-six has been substituted by an error of transcription for sixteen, or twenty-six; and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm" title="And there was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:19</a> by a similar mistake thirty-five has taken the place of fifteen or twenty-five. Upon the whole, the latter alternative appears preferable; and if we assume twenty-five and twenty-six to be the correct numerals, we get the following chronology for the reign :--First, ten years of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.">2Chronicles 14:1</a>), during which Asa strengthened his defences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/14-6.htm" title="And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.">2Chronicles 14:6-8</a>); then the invasion of Zerah, at what precise date is not clear, but at some time between the eleventh and the fifteenth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-10.htm" title="So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:10</a>); then the reformation of religion and renewal of the covenant in Asa's fifteenth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-10.htm" title="So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:10</a>); and lastly, another ten years of peace, until the outbreak of the war with Baasha, in the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year.<p>The idea of the ancient commentators, that the phrase "five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa" might mean "five and thirtieth year of the kingdom of Judah," is absurd. The phrase "<span class= "ital">bishnath</span> . . . <span class= "ital">lemalk-th"</span> always denotes the year of a king's reign, not of the duration of his kingdom. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm" title="And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.">2Chronicles 16:12</a> <span class= "ital">infra.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">And built Ramah.</span>--<span class= "ital">Er-Ram,</span> about five miles north of Jerusalem. Baasha had probably retaken the cities annexed by Abijah. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-8.htm" title="And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.">2Chronicles 15:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Built =</span> fortified it. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm" title="And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">1Kings 15:17</a> for the rest of the verse.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - For the <span class="cmt_word">six and thirtieth</span> <span class="cmt_word">year,</span> <span class="accented">read six and twentieth. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Ramah</span> belonged to Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21, 25, 28</a>), and lay between Bethel and Jerusalem, about five or six Roman miles from each; but Keil and Bertheau, by some error, call it thirty miles from Jerusalem, having very likely in their eye Ramah of Samuel, in Ephraim. The word signifies "lofty," and the present history speaks the importance of its position, and would infer also that Israel had regained Bethel, which, with other adjacent places, Abijah had wrested from Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>). The reference of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>, 82 is exceedingly interesting, and bespeaks the fact that Ramah commanded another intersecting route from Ephraim. When it is said here that Baasha built (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) Ramah, the meaning is that he was beginning to strengthen it greatly, and fortify it. The object of Baasha, which no doubt needed no stating in the facts of the day, is now stated by history. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
