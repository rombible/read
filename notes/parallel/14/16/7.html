The use of this term seems to point to an ancient source of this narrative which is peculiar to the chronicler. Nothing beyond what is here told is known of Hanani. He was perhaps the father of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani, who prophesied against Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,">1Kings 16:1</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>) and rebuked Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath on you from before the LORD.">2Chronicles 19:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria.</span>--Hanani's words are in perfect accord with the teachings of the greater prophets, a fact which favours their authenticity. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm" title="That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!">Isaiah 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm" title="For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.">Isaiah 30:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not.">Isaiah 30:15</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm" title="Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit.

This politic act secured its object, but from the prophetic point of view such success was no better than loss and failure; for it had deprived Asa of an assured triumph over the combined forces of Israel and Syria. Not only the defeat of Baasha's schemes, but victory over his formidable ally, would have been conceded to faith (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/13-14.htm" title="Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.">2Kings 13:14-19</a>). The Syriac renders, "Therefore shall the army of Ad-m (Aram) fly from thee." Then follows the curious addition: "And they shall go, and become strong, they and the Hindoos [<span class= "ital">Hendewoye</span>]<span class= "ital">,</span> and the kings that are with them, and they shall become armies and chariots and horsemen, a great multitude; and when thou shalt ask of the Lord God, He will deliver them into thy hands." It continues: "Because the eyes of the Lord see in all the earth. And show yourselves strong, and let your heart be devoted to his fear, and understand ye all his wonders, because the Lord your God maketh war for you. And Asa was wroth against the Seer, and put him in the prison, because he told what he saw not, and stirred the heart of the people." So also the Arabic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> The very impressive episode of four verses begun by the seventh verse is not found in the parallel. The fact furnishes clear indication that our compiler was not indebted to the writer of Kings for material. And the moral aspects of the matter here preserved by the compiler of Chronicles show the paramount reasons why he would not miss bringing it to the front for the returned people's better religious education. Presumably <span class="cmt_word">Hanani the seer</span> is the father of that other faithful seer and prophet Jehu, who appeared to Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1, 7</a>) and to Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore is the host of the King of Syria escaped out of thy hand</span> It is plain that, reading the lines only, this expression (remarkable considering its following close upon successful help given by Benhadad, and help unaccompanied, so far as we are told, by any infidelity or untoward circumstance), suggests option of explanation, and would engender the supposition that something very threatening was on the horizon, at any rate. But reading <span class="accented">between the</span> lines, and giving due weight to the significance of the illustration adduced of the combined Ethiopians and Lubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), we may warrantably judge that Hanani's inspired language went a cut deeper, and meant that if the alliance had been not broken between Benhadad and Baasha, both would surely have been taken in one net (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>), as they would have entered into the conflict in alliance. A decisive victory over the King of Syria would have been any way a grand day in the history of Judah; But such a victory over the Kings of Syria and of the northern schismatic kingdom would have been more than a doubly grand day; it would have been a tenfold demonstration of God's judgment, that "though hand join in hand, yet shall not the wicked go unpunished" (see particularly same Hebrew verb used of a bird escaped in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
