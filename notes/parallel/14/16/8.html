Cushites and Lybians were banded together in Zerah's great army, just as Syrians and Israelites might have united in assailing Judah, yet the victory had fallen to Asa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9-15</a>).<p>Cushites and Libyans were among the constituents of Shishak's army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>). Clearly, therefore, Zerah was master of Egypt.<p>(The Heb. of this and next verse is unmistakably the chronicler's own. Literally it runs: "Did not the Cushites and the Libyans come <span class= "ital">to</span> an army, <span class= "ital">to</span> abundance, (<span class= "ital">as</span>)<span class= "ital"> to</span> chariots and <span class= "ital">to</span> horsemen, <span class= "ital">to</span> abounding greatly?")<p>Neither the Libyan contingent nor the horsemen are mentioned in 2 Chronicles 14. Apparently the writer is making extracts from fuller sources.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
