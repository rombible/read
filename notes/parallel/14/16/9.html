Liter-ally, <span class= "ital">For</span> (the proof of thy folly) <span class= "ital">from henceforth,</span> &c. The sense appears to be that the peace secured by Asa's worldly policy would not be permanent; a prediction verified over and over again in the after-history of the kingdom of Judah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/28-20.htm" title="And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.">2Chronicles 28:20-21</a>). The record is silent as to any future wars in which Asa himself was involved, simply because the writer, having already fulfilled his didactic purpose so far as concerns this reign, presently draws its history to a close.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt have wars</span>. Although this language at first seems to be intended for very specific application to Asa, yet as we do not read of individual wars occurring after this in his own time, it is quite within a just interpretation of it if we read it as referring to the inevitable experience of the kingdom. Its head and king had just thrown away the opportunity of blocking out one ever-threatening enemy. What more natural consequence than that wars should rush in the rather as a flood, in the after-times? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.</body></html>
