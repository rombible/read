But the Syriac (and Arabic) here and in Kings has, "And this house shall be laid waste" (<span class= "ital">nehwe hreb</span>); and the Targum of Kings combines both readings thus: "And this house <span class= "ital">which is high shall be laid waste" </span>(<span class= "ital">y'he harib</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It appears, therefore, that the original reading of the Heb. text was, "And this house shall become <span class= "ital">ruinous heaps"</span> (<span class= "ital">'iyin,</span> "heaps," not <span class= "ital">'elyon,</span> "high"). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>. The mistake is as old as the LXX., <span class= "greekheb">? ????? ????? ? ??????</span><span class= "ital">.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it.</span>--<span class= "ital">Every one that passeth by it shall be astonished:</span> <span class= "greekheb">??? ? ?????????????? ????? ??????????</span>, LXX. Syriac, "Every one that passeth by it shall stop and shake his head, and sway with his hand, and say ". . . Kings adds, "and shall hiss" (certainly original).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The Hebrew text of the first sentence of this verse differs here from that in the parallel; but, in fact, neither text reads satisfactorily and smoothly. The parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>) inserts the little word "<span class="accented">at</span>," though without italics, and "<span class="accented">which"</span> in italic type. The "<span class="accented">at"</span> <span class="accented">is</span> no doubt intended to be condoned as supposed to belong to the word astonished; the following verb hiss also permitting, though not requiring, the appendage. Not leaning to the text of the parallel (which shows no <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, and which shows the substantive verb in the future tense <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), we need not find any particular difficulty in rendering our present text, <span class="cmt_word">And this house, which is</span> <span class="cmt_word">most high</span> (the word well favours this idea), shall <span class="cmt_word">be an astonishment to every passer by.</span> The Septuagint reads simply, "This lofty house." <span class="cmt_word">Why hath the Lord done</span> this? (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8, 9</a>). To the "astonishment" prophesied here the parallel adds, "shall hiss" - in a forcible expression found first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-8.htm">2 Chronicles 29:8</a>, and afterwards in Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>)and in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15, 16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-22 God's answer to Solomon's prayer. - God gave a gracious answer to Solomon's prayer. The mercies of God to sinners are made known in a manner well suited to impress all who receive them, with his majesty and holiness. The people worshipped and praised God. When he manifests himself as a consuming Fire to sinners, his people can rejoice in him as their Light. Nay, they had reason to say, that God was good in this. It is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, but the sacrifice in our stead, for which we should be very thankful. And whoever beholds with true faith, the Saviour agonizing and dying for man's sin, will, by that view, find his godly sorrow enlarged, his hatred of sin increased, his soul made more watchful, and his life more holy. Solomon prosperously effected all he designed, for adorning both God's house and his own. Those who begin with the service of God, are likely to go on successfully in their own affairs. It was Solomon's praise, that what he undertook, he went through with; it was by the grace of God that he prospered in it. Let us then stand in awe, and sin not. Let us fear the Lord's displeasure, hope in his mercy, and walk in his commandments.</body></html>
