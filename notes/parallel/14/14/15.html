This word "tents" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">construct state</span>) is used just 325 times, and this is the only time it is spoken of as the place of cattle; there are, however, four passages looking the same way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-5.htm">Genesis 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-7.htm">2 Kings 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>). It is the word used for the tabernacle of the wilderness many times, and many times for the place of abode that has highest associations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-15.htm">Psalm 118:15</a>), and of the usual abodes of people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-16.htm">2 Chronicles 10:16</a>). The use of the word here, though unique, will occasion no surprise, considering the camping of the vast invading army. <span class="cmt_word">Camels in abundance</span>. The mention of this spoil reminds us both where we are, on desert border (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm">1 Samuel 30:16, 17</a>), and what was the personality or nationality within some latitude of choice of the invaders. <span class="cmt_word">Returned to Jerusalem</span>. The expression awakens inevitably, though inaptly, a reminiscence of Scripture language in strangest contrast - the climax in a description also, but of a victory infinitely vaster and grander and for ever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>). This return of "Asa and the people that were with him" to Jerusalem dated the commencement of a period of comparative internal peace and reform for the kingdom of Judah, that lasted twenty-one years, and yet more of exemption from Egyptian attack, that lasted about three hundred and thirty years (B.C. circ. 940-609). It was a doubtful benefit, but Judah and Egypt came to be found in alliance against Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20, 21, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>). The 'Speaker's Commentary' points out the interesting fact that this was one of the only two occasions known of the Jews meeting in open field either Egypt or Assyria (the other occasion being the unfortunate one of Josiah against Necho, 2 Chronicles 35:30), and adds, "Shishak, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander, and Ptolemy I., were either unopposed or only opposed from behind wails." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom. - Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.</body></html>
