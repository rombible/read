Zerah is identified with Osorchon II., hieroglyphic Uasarken, who succeeded Shishak as king of Egypt. The name of this king is curiously like that of Sargon, the great Assyrian conqueror of the eighth century. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,">2Chronicles 12:2</a><span class= "ital">.</span>) The object of the expedition appears to have been to bring Judah again under the yoke of Egypt. Shishak had made Rehoboam tributary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-8.htm" title="Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.">2Chronicles 12:8</a>), after reducing his fortresses and plundering Jerusalem. But now Asa had restored the defences of his country, and apparently reorganised the fighting material; steps indicating a desire for national independence.<p><span class= "bld">A thousand thousand.</span>--This very large and symmetrical number would probably be best represented in English by an indefinite expression, like "myriads." It is otherwise out of all proportion to the three hundred chariots, which last seems a correct datum. Syriac and Arabic say "20,000 chariots."<p><span class= "bld">Mareshah.</span>--One of the fortresses of Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm" title="And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,">2Chronicles 11:8</a>). It lay in the lowland of Judah, about twenty-six miles south-west of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-15.</span> - The remaining seven verses of this chapter are occupied with the account of the invasion of <span class="accented">Zerah the Ethiopian</span>, and the successful defence and reprisals of Asa. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zerah the Ethiopian</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, the "Ethiopian," Greek and Septuagint rendering for "Cushite." In its vaguest dimensions Ethiopia, or Cush, designated Africa south of Egypt, but more concisely it meant the lands we now call Nubia, Sennaar, Kordefan, and part of Abyssinia. And these, roughly speaking, were bounded north, south, east, and west respectively by Egypt and Syene, Abyssinia, Red Sea, and Libyan Desert. When, however, Ethiopia proper is spoken of, the name probably designates the kingdom of Meroe (<span class="accented">Seba</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); and the Assyrian inscriptions make the Cushite name of the deified Nimrod <span class="accented">one with</span> Meroe), which was so closely associated at different times with Egypt, that sometimes an Egypt king swayed it (as e.g. some eighteen hundred years before <span class="accented">Shishak</span>, Sesostris fourth king of the twelfth dynasty), and sometimes <span class="accented">vice versa</span> (as e.g. the three Ethiopian kings of the twenty-fifth dynasty - Shabak (<span class="accented">Sabakhou</span>), Sethos (<span class="accented">Sebechos</span>), and Tarkos (<span class="accented">Tirhakah</span>), whose reigning dates as between Ethiopia and Egypt are not yet certified). The name thus confined covers an irregular circular bulk of country between "the modern Khartoum, where the <span class="accented">Astapus</span> joins the true Nile, and the influx of the <span class="accented">Astaboras</span>, into their united stream." From the language of Diodorus (1:23), harmonized conjecturally with Strabo (18:821), the region may be counted as 375 miles in circumference and 125 miles in the diameter of the erratic circle, its extreme south point being variously stated, distant from Syene, 873 miles (Pliny, 6:29. &sect; 33); or, according to Mannert's book ('Geogr. d. Alt.,' 10:183), 600 miles by the assertion of Artemidorns, or 625 by that of Eratosthenes. Thence the "Cushite" extended probably to the Euphrates and the Tigris, and through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia. Some, however, think that the Cushite now intended was the Ethiopian of <span class="accented">Arabia</span>, who had settlement near Gerar (Dr. Jamieson, in 'Comm.') as a nomadic horde. Dr. Jamieson quotes Bruce's 'Travels' to support this view, which seems a most improbable, not to say impossible, one nevertheless. The question as to the people intended will perhaps best be found in the solution of the question for whom the name of their king stands (see following note). Zerah. Hebrew as above. It is noteworthy that the four previous occurrences of this name - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-13.htm">Genesis 36:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-37.htm">1 Chronicles 1:37</a>, son of Reuel, grandson of Esau; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>, son of Judah and Tumor; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a>, son of Simeon; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-6.htm">1 Chronicles 5:6, 26</a>, Hebrew text, son of Iddo, a Gershonite Levite - show it as the name of an Israelite, or descendant of Shem. Our present <span class="accented">Zerah</span> is a <span class="accented">Cushite</span>, or descendant of Ham. The Septuagint forms of the name are <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, or (Alexandrian) <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Although Professor Dr. Murphy says ('Handbook: Chronicles,' p. 116) that "it is plain that Zerah was a sovereign of Kush, who in the reign of Takeloth, about <span class="date">B.C. 944</span>, invaded Egypt and penetrated into Asia," the balance of probability, both from the names themselves and the synchronisms of history, corroborated by the composition of Zerah's army (Cushim and Lubim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>) and some other tributary considerations, is that our <span class="accented">Zerah</span> was Usarken II., the fourth king of the twenty-second dynasty (or possibly Usarken I., the second king of the dynasty). The invasion of the text was probably in Asa's fourteenth year, his reign thus far being dated <span class="date">B.C. 953-940</span> (or <span class="date">B.C. 933-920</span> if Manasseh's be taken at only thirty-five instead of fifty-five years). The alleged army of this Zerah was an Egyptian army, largely made of mercenaries (compare the description of Shishak's army, ch. 12:3). The present defeat of Zerah would go far to explain the known decline of the Egyptian power at just this date, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some twenty-five to thirty years after Shishak. At the same time, it must be admitted that it is not possible to identify with certainty Zerah with either Usarken. Whether he is an unknown Arabian Cushite, or an unknown African Cushite of Ethiopia-above-Egypt, or one of the Usarkens, has yet to be pronounced. <span class="cmt_word">Mareshah</span> (see our note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). It lay the "second mile" (Eusebius and Jerome) south of Eleutheropolis and between Hebron (1 Maccabees 5:36; 2 Maccabees 12:35) and Ashdod (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:08. &sect; 6). The mention of the valley of Zephathah in the following verse will half identify its exact position. It is probable that Dr. Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:67) and Toblev in his interesting , Dritto Wand.' (pp. 129, 142), have reliably fixed the site one Roman mile south-west of the modern <span class="accented">Beit-Jibrin.</span> Mareshah is again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>, as quoted already, in references interesting to be consulted. A thousand thousand. Whether this number be correct or not, it may be noted that it is the largest alleged number of an army given in the Old Testament. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom. - Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.</body></html>
