Others assume <span class= "ital">between</span> . . . <span class= "ital">to,</span> to mean <span class= "ital">whether</span> . . . <span class= "ital">or,</span> which would be in accordance with Rabbinic rather than ancient usage. A very plausible view is that of Kamphausen, who proposes to read <span class= "ital">la'cor</span> for <span class= "ital">la'zor</span> ("to retain strength" for "to help"), an expression which actually occurs at the end of the verse, and to render the whole: "Lord, it is not for any to retain (strength) with (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to withstand) Thee, whether strong or powerless." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-20.htm" title="Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.">2Chronicles 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-14.htm" title="But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.">1Chronicles 29:14</a>). The Syriac paraphrases thus: "Thou art our Lord, the helper of thy people. When thou shalt deliver a great army into the hands of a few, then all the inhabitants of the world will know that we rightly trust in thee." This is much more like a Targum than a translation. The difficulty of the text is evaded, not explained.<p><span class= "bld">We rest.</span>--<span class= "ital">Rely</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-18.htm" title="Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 13:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">We go.</span>--<span class= "ital">We are come.</span><p><span class= "bld">This multitude.</span>--<span class= "ital">H?mon;</span> a term used of Jeroboam's army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-8.htm" title="And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and you be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.">2Chronicles 13:8</a>), and usually denoting an <span class= "ital">armed</span> multitude.<p><span class= "bld">Let not man prevail.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Let not mortal man retain</span> (strength) <span class= "ital">with thee.</span><p><span class= "bld">With.</span>--<span class= "ital">Against,</span> as in the phrase "to fight with."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nothing with thee</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>. In the passage of very similar tenor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>) the exact rendering is more easily fixed, "It is nothing to the Lord," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it makes no difference to the Lord, "to save by many or by few." Probably the correcter rendering of our present Hebrew text would be, "It makes no difference with thee to help those whose strength is great or whose strength is nothing (between the much <span class="accented">even</span> to the none of strength)." Keil and Bertheau would translate "There is none beside thee." For another instance of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a>. The prayer must be counted a model prayer to an omnipotent Deliverer. It consists of opening invocation and the instancing of what postulates the crowning Divine attribute as the broad foundation for argument; of invocation repeated, warmed to closer clinging by the appropriating "oar;" attended by the defining, though very universal petition, <span class="cmt_word">Help us</span>; and followed by the argument of the unbending fidelity of trusting dependence, For we rest <span class="cmt_word">on thee, and in thy Name we go against this multitude</span>; and, lastly, of invocation renewed or still determinedly sustained, pressed home by the clenching challenge of relationship and its correlative responsibility and presumable holy pride. The antithesis marked in these two last clauses will not escape notice - one made all the bolder, with the marginal reading of "mortal mall" for the emphatic (a poetical, universal kind of) word here employed (<span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) for man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom. - Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.</body></html>
