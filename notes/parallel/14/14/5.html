The <span class="accented">images</span> spoken of here are, of coarse, not the same with those (noted upon already) of ver. 3.

This, however, is the rendering adopted by not a few modern commentators (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4</a>). Gesenius would render "the Sun-Bard," or "the Sun-Lord," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> statues of the sun, representing a deity to whom (see ' Phoen. Inseript.') votive stones,were inscribed. In his 'Thesaurus' (p. 489) Gesenius instances the Phoenician inscriptions, as showing that <span class="accented">our chemmanim</span> denoted statues of both Baal, the sun-god, and Astarte, the moon-goddess. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom. - Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.</body></html>
