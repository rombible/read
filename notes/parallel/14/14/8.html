The same phrase is used to describe the warriors of Judah. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-24.htm" title="The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.">1Chronicles 12:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That bare shields</span>--i.e., the short or round shield (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm" title="And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.">2Chronicles 9:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Drew bows.</span>--(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm" title="And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor, archers, and had many sons, and sons' sons, an hundred and fifty. All these are of the sons of Benjamin.">1Chronicles 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.">1Chronicles 12:2</a>.) The Judaeans were the <span class= "ital">hoplites,</span> or heavy-armed; the Benjaminites the light-armed, or <span class= "ital">peltasts,</span> as a Greek writer would have said.<p><span class= "bld">Three hundred thousand . . . two hundred and fourscore thousand.</span>--A total of 580,000, warriors. (Comp.

The entire male population capable of bearing arms must be included in these high figures. Of course, such a thing as a standing army of this strength is not to be thought of.<p>The proportion of Benjamin relatively to Judah appears much too high. It must, however, be remembered that Benjamin was always famous as a tribe of warriors. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-27.htm" title="Benjamin shall shred as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.">Genesis 49:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/7-6.htm" title="The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.">1Chronicles 7:6-11</a>.)<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) <span class= "bld">INVASION OF THE CUSHITE ZERAH, AND HIS SIGNAL OVERTHROW</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9-15</a>)--This Section has no Parallel in Kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The "ten years' quiet" (ver. 1) begins to see its end. <span class="cmt_word">Targets</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>); spears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>); for both, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-24.htm">1 Chronicles 12:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Out of Benjamin... shields and... bows</span>.

Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.</body></html>
