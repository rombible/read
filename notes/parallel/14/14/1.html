And the land had rest forty years.">Judges 5:31</a>). The phrase is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-6.htm" title="And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.">2Chronicles 14:6</a>, "He had no war in those years."<p>During this period of repose Asa strengthened the defences of his country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm" title="Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.">2Chronicles 14:5</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm" title="And there was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:19</a>).<p>The name Asa may perhaps mean "healer;" (comp. the Syriac <span class= "ital">'os? "</span>physician," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm" title="And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.">2Chronicles 16:12</a>); or "spices" (Syriac <span class= "ital">'oso</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm" title="And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.">2Chronicles 16:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Buried... in the city of David</span> (see our note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-16.htm">2 Chronicles 12:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Asa his</span> <span class="cmt_word">son</span>. If, according to the suggestion of our note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a> and 2 Chron 12:13, the alleged forty-one years of the age of Rehoboam be made twenty-one, it will follow that Asa could not now be more than a boy of some twelve years of age. It is against that suggestion that there is no sign of this, by word or deed, in what is here said of the beginning of Asa's reign; the signs are to the contrary, especially taking into the question the indications given us respecting the tendencies, if not contradicted, of the queen-mother Maachah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), and it is not supposable that a boy of twelve years of age could contradict them. This point must be held still moot. <span class="cmt_word">In his days... quiet ten years</span>. No doubt one cause of this was the defeat that Jeroboam and Israel had sustained at the hands of Abijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-18.htm">2 Chronicles 13:18-20</a>). It appears also, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, that after that defeat a league was instituted between Abijah and the then King of Syria: "There is a league between me and thee, and between <span class="accented">my father and thy father."</span> And these things, with Israel's new kings, and <span class="accented">perhaps</span> Asa's extreme youth, would have favoured the repose of the land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-15 Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom. - Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him. Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.</body></html>
