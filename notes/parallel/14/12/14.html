The important particulars about the reign which are not given in Kings, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the fortification of the southern cities, the migration of the priests, and Rehoboam's private relations, were probably drawn by the chronicler from these sources.<p><span class= "bld">First and last.</span>--<span class= "ital">The former and the latter.</span> (See on, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm" title="And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not to Baalim;">2Chronicles 17:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And there were wars.</span>--<span class= "ital">And the wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam</span> [continued] <span class= "ital">all the days, i.e., </span>throughout the reign.

And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.">2Chronicles 11:4</a>. What Shemaiah forbade was a particular attempt to recover the obedience of the northern kingdom by force of arms. The permanent attitude of the rival kings could hardly be other than hostile, especially as Jeroboam appears to have instigated the Egyptian invasion of Judah; and this hostility must often have broken out into active injuries.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - These summarizing moral estimates of the character of the succeeding kings are, indeed, common to the compilers of both Chronicles and Kings, though absent, in the case of Rehoboam, from the parallel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 Rehoboam, forsaking the Lord, is punished. - When Rehoboam was so strong that he supposed he had nothing to fear from Jeroboam, he cast off his outward profession of godliness. It is very common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger, or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throw aside all their religion when they have received a merciful deliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken the people to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justify God, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humbling providences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, or the property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared with other services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are the laws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be found much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the service of our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed in his religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heart to seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord, because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, for wisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek to that as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of his religion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determined for good.</body></html>
