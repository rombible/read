The parallel does not give the numbers. These are large, but not inconsistent with those mentioned in other connections, whether those of Solomon, or, going further back, of Pharaoh. <span class="cmt_word">Lubims</span>. The letter <span class="accented">s</span> is orthographically redundant in this, as also in the following names, the forms being already plural. The <span class="accented">Lubim</span> mean the Libyans, west of Egypt. They are probably the people represented on the Egyptian monuments as <span class="accented">Lebu</span>, of Semitic type, subjugated by Egypt's kings in the <span class="date">thirteenth century B.C.</span> They were among the oldest of colonists, that drifted along the coast of Africa, north of the Great Desert, from the East, and are perhaps the same as the Lehabim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-43.htm">Daniel 11:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). <span class="accented">Sukkiims</span>.

They are not mentioned elsewhere so as to be recognized. <span class="cmt_word">Ethiopians</span>. These were ethnically Cushites, but the territorial application of the term was confined to the African Cushite settlers. It is remarkable that, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, Ethiopians are classed with Arabians, but otherwise with African peoples, and in particular Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). They were many-tribed, and the Sabaeans were a leading tribe of them. It is evident that Shishak could draw from a large and varied dominion subject to his dynasty at this time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 Rehoboam, forsaking the Lord, is punished. - When Rehoboam was so strong that he supposed he had nothing to fear from Jeroboam, he cast off his outward profession of godliness. It is very common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger, or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throw aside all their religion when they have received a merciful deliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken the people to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justify God, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humbling providences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, or the property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared with other services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are the laws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be found much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the service of our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed in his religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heart to seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord, because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, for wisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek to that as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of his religion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determined for good.</body></html>
