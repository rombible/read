This word is found only in three other places, viz. twice in the parallel (its vers. 8, 15), Revised Version "ranks," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>, where it is rendered in the Authorized Version "the boards," but in the Revised Version "the planks<span class="accented"></span>," and margin "rows." The ranges are commonly supposed to mean the ranks or rows of soldiers. The Vulgate (<span class="accented">septa templi</span>) has understood them to mean the precincts of the temple. The indications of the remarkable but not uncommon prepositional expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (enjoying the analogy of ether compounded prepositional expressions, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;</span>) favours the idea that Jehoiada said, <span class="cmt_word">Have her forth from</span> inside "the house of the Lord" (ver. 12), <span class="accented">to within your ranks</span>, and there take care to make a way for her, no one with immature zeal following to slay her <span class="accented">there</span>, at the jeopardy of his own life, for under no case let her be slain in <span class="cmt_word">the house of the Lord.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.</body></html>
