The chronicler has added the explanatory words: "belonging to the priests and to the Levites." This can hardly be harmonised with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/12-4.htm" title="And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passes the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,">2Kings 12:4-12</a> - The chronicler may have misunderstood the words, which in the older account designate the royal guard; and it might have appeared to him impossible that any but members of the sacred orders would be called together <span class= "ital">in the Temple</span> by the high priest. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/23-5.htm" title="And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 23:5-6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm" title="And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.">2Kings 11:4</a> : "brought them <span class= "ital">into</span> <span class= "ital">the house of the Lord."</span>) But he may also have had before him an account in which the part taken by the sacerdotal caste in the revolution was made much more of than m the account of Kings. Moreover the priests and Levites would be likely to play a considerable part in a movement tending to the overthrow of a <span class= "ital">cultus</span> antagonistic to their own, especially when that movement originated with their own spiritual head, and was transacted in the sanctuary to which they were attached. The chronicler, therefore, cannot with fairness be accused of "arbitrary alterations," unless it be presupposed that his <span class= "ital">sole</span> authority in writing this account was the Second Book of Kings. The priests and Levites used to do duty in the Temple from Sabbath to Sabbath, so that one course relieved another at the end of each week. (See 1 Chronicles 24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-5.htm" title="THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.">Luke 1:5</a>.) That the companies of the royal guards succeeded each other on duty in the same fashion is clear from the parallel narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be porters of the doors.</span>--<span class= "ital">Warders of the thresholds,</span> that is, of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-19.htm" title="And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.">1Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm" title="All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.">1Chronicles 9:22</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1Kings 11:5</a> says: "The third of you that come in on the Sabbath, they shall keep the <span class= "ital">guard of the king's house;</span> "the latter part of which answers to the first sentence of the next verse: "And the third part (shall be) at the king's house." The king's "house" in Kings means the royal palace; the chronicler appears to mean by it his temporary dwelling within the Temple precincts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The first thing that is to be observed is the distinct and repeated mention of the <span class="accented">Levites</span>, as those on whom the critical and onerous service that came of Jehoiada's resolution was devolved, while the parallel does not so much as mention them. It may next be noted that our first and second verses state the part that "the captains of hundreds" were called to perform in <span class="accented">collecting</span> the requisite number of Levites from the provincial cities of Judah. And once more it may be noted that whereas, while we abide close by our own text alone, nothing in the description of our vers. 4-10 occasions material difficulty, even when the perplexity, which is considerable, does enter, on consulting and endeavouring to reconcile the parallel, it is with extreme probability due to our not making sufficient allowance for the fact that the matter of the two accounts does not so much offer itself for reconciliation as for concurrent acceptance. We have now to follow the description of our own text. <span class="cmt_word">Of you entering on the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of you who enter on your period of duty on such a sabbath. See ver. 8, the "men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath." This alludes, as the next clause definitely says, to the weekly courses of the Levites, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-25.htm">1 Chronicles 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>. - the incoming and outgoing companies. <span class="cmt_word">Porters of the doors;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "keepers of the doors of the temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>). This may correspond with the middle clause of ver. 6 in the parallel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.</body></html>
