The chronicler characteristically dwells on the share of the Levites in the matter; but he does not expressly <span class= "ital">exclude</span> the royal guard; and it is utterly unfair to allege that he has metamorphosed the guardsmen of Kings into Levites, "in order to divert to the priesthood the honour which properly belonged to the Praetorians" (<span class= "ital">Thenius</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The truth may perhaps be that the high priest Jehoiada brought about a combination of the royal guard with the Levitical warders of the Temple; and that the united body acted under the command of the five centurions of the guard.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh into the house.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-8.htm" title="And you shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that comes within the ranges, let him be slain: and be you with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.">2Kings 11:8</a> has, "into the ranks;" a rare word (<span class= "ital">sed?roth</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> occurring only four times, viz., in this narrative thrice, and once in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-8.htm" title="The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.">1Kings 6:8</a> (in a different sense).<p><span class= "bld">But be</span> <span class= "bld">ye.</span>--So Kings.

The matter of ver. 8 in the parallel suggests nothing inconsistent with the express mention of the Levites here, but rather that the word "Levites" is desiderated there, and its significance perhaps accidentally overlooked, when the writer of Kings was using the original authorities and sources of his history. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.</body></html>
