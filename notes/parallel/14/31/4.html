Hezekiah's object was to send impulses of energy through the whole nation. The portions here spoken of are described originally in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22, 23</a>. After our word "encouraged," we may probably supply the words "to teach;" for see our ch. 2 Chronicles 17:9. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-21 Hezekiah destroys idolatry. - After the passover, the people of Israel applied with vigour to destroy the monuments of idolatry. Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.</body></html>
