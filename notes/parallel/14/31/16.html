The meaning is that the Levites who were on duty in the Temple, and whose names were registered as such, along with their male children of three years old and upwards, were not provided for by Cononiah and his associates, as they received their daily portion in the sanctuary itself. Children, it appears, were allowed to accompany their fathers to the Temple, and to eat with them of the sacrifices.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside their</span> <span class="cmt_word">genealogy of males</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> except (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) the family count of males, etc., the remainder of the verse describing those who are meant by the <span class="accented">excepted.</span> They were excepted because for themselves and their little ones, their daily present temple service brought their daily maintenance as of course.

Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.</body></html>
