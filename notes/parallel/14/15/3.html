This translation is wrong; translate rather first, <span class="accented">And many the days to Israel to not have true God, and to not have teaching priest, and to not have Law</span>. So far no tense is limited, however naturally through the very drift of the passage it may seem that <span class="accented">experience</span> is being challenged, and so necessarily the past tense desiderated, not, however, in <span class="accented">aorist</span> shape, but in what some French grammarians call present perfect. For Azariah may well contemplate his illustration as good from long of old, to the very moment he was speaking. The unfortunate wealth of illustration to hand of his position may pardon the doubtfulness of commentators as to the source from which it may be supposed he would have drawn his most effective instances. It will not be the unlikeliest guide to follow the triple description of the alleged apostasy, misfortune, or iniquity "of Israel," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> (say) it <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the true God</span>; <span class="accented">happened to</span> them <span class="cmt_word">to not have teaching priest</span>; <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the Law</span> (this meaning, to not have it authoritatively proclaimed, taught, ministered). When did these three things <span class="accented">happen</span> altogether most notoriously? They describe, not the transgressions of an individual king, but the state of the people and kingdom as a whole. If it were possible to conceive the description as a flagrant anachronism, a retrospective post-Captivity amplification, which the writer (in his glow of work and thought) was unconsciously and irresistibly betrayed into putting into the lips of the Prophet Azariah, all doubt would end; for the description would suit no state of things and no period better than that of the divided kingdoms, especially applying to the career of the separate kingdom of Israel. Our account, unfortunately, is unchecked just here by a parallel. It is, however, impossible to suppose this without any tittle of external authority for it, much less enough to proceed upon. Some so crave the illustration that they are prepared to suppose all the tenses of these verses present and future rather than past and "present perfect." But, in fact, no doubt the history of Israel since the death of Moses illustrated the language of Azariah <span class="accented">passim</span> to a degree beyond all "that is written" or that we know. And then we may certainly consider theft the expression chosen, "many days" (which some translate "many a day," "many a time "), even the word "years" not being employed, leaves it open to us to go to short episodes of an irreligious and disastrous character in the history of Israel. Lastly, the long stretch of fully three hundred years, extending throughout the Book of Judges (its last five chapters in right order or wrong)into the opening seven chapters of 1 Samuel, provides one running comment, superabundant almost to repetitiousness, for the illustration of our vers. 3-7; in many cases absolutely <span class="accented">picking out</span> the very colours to match (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29, 31</a>, compared with our ver. 5). To distinguish and separate the very numerous references that might be made is merely supererogatory, and spoils the unmatched mosaic work of the history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15, 18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6, 19-21, 31</a>: 6:1-5, 7-10; 9:32-37; 10:6-16; 11:19, 20; 12:5, 6; 17:5, 6, 13; 20:29, 31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30 -35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>). It is a long-stretched-out history of a practically atheistic, priest-less, lawless life; divided into narratives of invasion, oppression, servitude (sevenfold, the Mesopotamian, Moabite, Canaanitish, Midianitish, Ammonitish, Philistine, and, it may be added, in order to comprehend all internal strife, Ishmaelitish larger and lesser, yet surprisingly general), smart, cry for help manifestly more the cry of pain and cowardice than of penitence and repentance, resolution and vow, and - for another trial and still another - of Divine pity, forbearance, and deliverance <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.</body></html>
