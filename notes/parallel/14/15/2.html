(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm" title="And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.">1Chronicles 28:9</a>; and for the last clause, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm" title="Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus said the LORD, You have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.">2Chronicles 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2Chronicles 24:20</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/29-13.htm" title="And you shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart.">Jeremiah 29:13-14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He will be found.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">is found.</span><p><span class= "bld">He will forsake.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">heforsaketh.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went out to meet him;</span> literally, <span class="accented">into his presence</span>; but the Authorized Version rendering is very correct, as well as happy in expression (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-8.htm">1 Chronicles 14:8</a>; also see the remarkable and interesting verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-9.htm">2 Chronicles 28:9</a>). The prophet was the leader, the teacher, the suggester of the right and opportune thing to the people, but to the prophet the Lord himself was Leader, Teacher, Prompter, and it was exactly so now. To the very moment, the quickened moment of new thought and for new deed, divinest instruction and suggestion are ministered. The Lord is with you... will forsake you. The original occasion of the beautiful language and word of covenant in the heart of this second part of the verse is enshrined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>). It is just conceivable that these words by themselves are what are designated "the prophecy" (<span class="accented">and</span> "the prophecy") in ver. 8. They may be in the first place regarded as ancient quotations. They are also characterized by a certain self-containedness and weightiness of matter as compared with the historic illustrations of the following four verses. No corroborative <span class="accented">external</span> evidence of this conjecture, however, is forthcoming. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.</body></html>
