Others have supposed that Maachah the mother of Abijah, and Maachah the "mother" of Asa, were different persons, the former being the daughter of Absalom, the latter the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There are really no grounds for this. Maachah, the mother of Abijah, enjoyed the rank of queen-mother not only during his short reign of three years, but also during that of her grandson Asa, until deposed by him on account of her idolatry.<p><span class= "bld">Queen.</span>--<span class= "ital">Gebirah, lady, mistress;</span> but always used of a queen.

His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.">2Chronicles 22:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">An idol.</span>--<span class= "ital">Miphletseth; a thing of fear; a horror;</span> a term only found here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>.

So Moses treated the golden calf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-20.htm" title="And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.">Exodus 32:20</a>); and Josiah the high place at Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Maachah the mother of Asa</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the grandmother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2, 10, 13</a>) of Asa; and the statement amounts to this, that Asa removed her from the dignity she had enjoyed, with all its influences of "queen-mother." <span class="cmt_word">An idol in a grove</span>. This, probably, literally translated, says, <span class="accented">an hideous fright for, i.e.</span> <span class="accented">in place of Asherah, i.e.</span> Ashtoreth, or Astarte; but some translate to Asherah. The word we translate "an hideous fright" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>) occurs only here and in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), and its derivation root guides to this rendering; but some give it the idea of an object of reverent fear among idols<span class="cmt_word">. Asa cut down</span>. So it was enjoined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And stamped it</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>; hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; the meaning being "stamped it" in the dust, from its upright position, finally burning it. The word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-36.htm">Exodus 30:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>. The word used in the parallel is "cut off;" or "cut down; of course also preparatory to burning. <span class="cmt_word">At the brook Kidron</span>. The Kidron was a torrent rather than a <span class="accented">brook</span>. It flowed between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and finally emptied itself into the Dead Sea. The references to Kidron in the Old Testament are interesting, but all reinvested with heightened interest from those in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>, compared with what the parallels infer; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-26.htm">Mark 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>). The first two references in the Old Testament are <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-37.htm">1 Kings 2:37</a>. Passing these, the present place, with its parallel, brings the Kidren valley next under notice as, the place of destruction for Maachah's obscene phallic abomination, and then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>) as the place where Athalish was destroyed. Its associations are similar when spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4, 6, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-16.htm">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a>, becoming the "regular receptacle for the impurities and abominations of the idol-worship, when removed from the temple and destroyed by the adherents of Jehovah." In the time of Josiah, this valley was the common burying-place of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>). (For Robinson's description of the modern state of the Kidron valley, see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:14-16). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.</body></html>
