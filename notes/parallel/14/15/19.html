(Both <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-16.htm" title="And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.">1Kings 15:16</a> and the present <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm" title="And there was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:19</a> begin with the same two Hebrew words, meaning "and war was," but the chronicler inserts a <span class= "ital">not</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>The verse of Kings need not imply more than that no amicable relations were ever established between the two sovereigns. They had inherited a state of war, although neither was in a condition to make an open attack upon the other for some years.<p><span class= "bld">The five and thirtieth year of the reign</span> <span class= "bld">of Asa.</span>--This limit does not agree with the data of Kings (seo on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1</a>). Thenius suggests that the letter <span class= "ital">l,</span> denoting 30, got into the text originally, through some transcriber, who inadvertently wrote the <span class= "ital">l</span> with which the next Hebrew word begins twice over. Later on, some other copyist naturally corrected <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1</a>, to agree with this. Assuming thus that the right readings here were originally <span class= "ital">the fifth</span> and <span class= "ital">sixth</span> years of the reign of Asa, Thenius concludes that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1</a> the letter <span class= "ital">v </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> 6) has been shortened into <span class= "ital">y</span> (10); and that Baasha's attempt preceded the invasion of Zerah. The false dates probably existed already in the source which the chronicler followed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was no more war</span>. The Hebrew text should be adhered to, which simply says, <span class="accented">there was not war unto</span>, etc The <span class="cmt_word">five and thirtieth year.</span> There can be little doubt that the text originally said "twentieth," not "thirtieth" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16.htm">2 Chronicles 16</a>-1). The parallel, after the identical words Of the previous verse already noted, goes on emphatically to speak of the fact that "there was war between Asa and Baasha all their days;" and the same statement is repeated in the thirty-second verse of the sa<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16, 32</a>). The following verse (33) says that Baasha's twenty-four-year reign began in Asa's third year. Putting the various and apparently somewhat varying statements together, they must be held to say, <span class="accented">first</span>, that a state of war was, indeed, chronic between Asa and Baasha (which way of putting need not disturb the correctness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5, 6</a>, and of the fifteenth verse of our chapter), but that in the six and twentieth year of Asa, which would be the last or last but one of Baasha's life, latent war gave place to active hostilities, and Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>) came up to Judah to invade it, and to build Ramah - a course of conduct which was the beginning of the end for him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8</a>; our ver. 10; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1, 9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.</body></html>
