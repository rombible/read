It is generally assumed that in both passages there is a somewhat inaccurate reference to the conquests of Abijah recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm" title="And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.">2Chronicles 13:19</a>; for hitherto <span class= "ital">Asa</span> had had no wars with the northern kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

But Asa may have annexed some of the towns on his northern border without resistance, after his victory over Zerah. (Comp. the voluntary immigration into Judah described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9</a>.)

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-4.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These words and the</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophecy.</span> In addition to what is said under ver. 1 on the question of the occurrence here of the name Oded, where we should have looked for the name <span class="accented">Azariah</span>, it may be noted that it is open to possibility that "these words" certainly referring to the language of Azariah, the "prophecy" may have in view some quotation more or less well known from Oded, satisfied by the latter part of ver. 2 or By ver. 7. This is not very likely; still, the conjunction "and" would thereby better account for itself. Nevertheless, it would still remain that the word "prophecy" is not in <span class="accented">construct</span> but absolute state, and we cannot count the difficulty removed, comparatively unimportant as it may be<span class="cmt_word">. He took courage, and put away</span>, etc. These words may express either Asa's accomplishing of the reforms spoken of in the former chapter (vers. 3-5), or quite as probably his perseverance and renewed diligence and vigour in the same; the language, "he took courage," favours this latter view. <span class="cmt_word">The cities which he had taken from</span>, etc. Some say that the reference here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> also must be understood to be to <span class="accented">Abijah's</span> victory and spoils (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), and that these two places must accordingly be in slight error. If this passage had stood alone, this view might have been more easy to accept, but the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> explicitly state that Asa had taken such cities, and the mere fact that the history does not record <span class="accented">when</span>, nor even show any very convenient gap into which Asa's taking of such cities after conflict with Israel might well fit in, can scarcely be allowed to override the direct assertion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-11.htm">2 Chronicles 16:11</a>). At the same time, the work that would devolve on Asa in <span class="accented">holding</span> the cities his father Abijah had first taken, may easily account for all, and have been accounted Asa's taking, in the sense of <span class="accented">taking</span> to them, or retaking them. <span class="cmt_word">Renewed the altar</span>. The altar, the place of which was <span class="cmt_word">before the porch</span>, was the altar of burnt offering. The Hebrew for "renewed" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The Vulgate translates insufficiently <span class="accented">dedicavit.</span> Bertheau thinks the renewal designs simply the purification of it from idolatrous defilements, although he admits that this is to assume that it had been defiled by idolatrous priests. Keil says the altar might well need genuine repair after the lapse of sixty years from the building of the temple. Of the nine occurrences of the word. five are metaphorical(as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>), but of the remaining four distinctly literal uses, including the present, three must mean just strictly "repair" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>), and the probability may therefore be that such is the meaning now. Many, however, prefer the other view. The work of Ass, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3-5</a>, was one of taking away, breaking down, and cutting down; but this item shows it now, in his fifteenth year, become also one of renewing. and repairing.

He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.</body></html>
