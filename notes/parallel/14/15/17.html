An explanation of the discrepancy has been suggested there; but a better one perhaps may be thus stated. The former passage relates what the good king had resolved and attempted to effect; the present records his want of success, owing to the obstinate attachment of his people to their old sanctuaries.<p>A similar explanation applies to the apparent contradiction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm" title="And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.">2Chronicles 17:6</a> by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-33.htm" title="However, the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts to the God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 20:33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Out of Israel.</span>--Not in Kings.

It is possible, but scarcely tenable, that, by Israel, the northern kingdom may be here intended. But for the apparent discrepancy with those places which say that Asa <span class="accented">did</span> take away "the high places" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3, 5</a>), see notes under them, and &sect;7. 1, pp. 16, 17, of 'Introduction to 1 Chronicles.' "The high places" were hills on which sacrifices were illegitimately offered instead of at the chosen place - at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of Asa was perfect all his days</span>. The words, "with Jehovah," following after the word "perfect" in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>), makes the already plain plainer. The exact meaning is that Asa was consistently free from idolatry to the end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.</body></html>
