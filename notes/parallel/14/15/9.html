members of the northern kingdom. A similar accession to the southern kingdom had taken place under Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-16.htm" title="And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 11:16</a>); and another yet is related in the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-11.htm" title="Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 30:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-18.htm" title="For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.

Perhaps a portion of the tribe had migrated northward (comp. Judges 18), and some of these now settled again in Judah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm" title="Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.">Genesis 49:7</a> speaks of Simeon as "divided in Jacob, and scattered in Israel."<p>Another solution is, that although politically one with Judah, the tribe of Simeon was religiously isolated by its illegal worship established at Beersheba, similar to that at Bethel and Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm" title="Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:">Amos 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm" title="But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.">Amos 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm" title="They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Your god, O Dan, lives; and, The manner of Beersheba lives; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.">Amos 8:14</a>).

But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.">1Chronicles 20:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He gathered</span>. As the following verses go on to show, Ass wisely gathered all beneath his sway, with a view to sacrifice and to record anew hallowed resolve as a nation. <span class="cmt_word">The strangers</span>. It is a significant comment on the estranging effect of religious schism (for the schism was religious even beyond what it was <span class="accented">national</span>) that so comparatively soon these of the tribes of Israel should have become called "strangers" by the side of <span class="cmt_word">Judah and Benjamin. They fell to him... in abundance</span>. Another significant comment on the sameness of human nature in all time; the weak and the multitude will see, learn, do duty, less under pure conviction of right, than under the strong commanding influence of observation of where and with whom success goes, even if that success necessitate the owning of the Divine blessing as its cause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-16.htm">2 Chronicles 11:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19</a>). It should be noted, not for the sake of satire of human nature, but for the inculcation of the infinite importance of godly influence and example. <span class="cmt_word">Out of Simeon</span> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>). The "lines" of the Simeonites fell to them originally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>) within Judah. The difficulty suggested by their being called, apparently, "strangers," and being certainly classed with the comers from "Ephraim and Manasseh," may be variously overcome, either by supposing that they had become more estranged from Judah in religious position than it was possible to them to have become in merely geographical; or that they had in some degree outgrown their own proper habitat, and had to some extent colonized a more northerly region (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>); or that, though, indeed, our compiler's composition undoubtedly places the Simeonites summoned, among <span class="accented">the strangers</span>, through mentioning them after Ephraim and Manasseh, yet this location of their name be held accidental, rather than due to special design. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.</body></html>
