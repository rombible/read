(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-9.htm" title="And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.">Ezekiel 26:9</a>.) The phrase qualifies the word "cities." The cities of Israel had been ruined by the Assyrians, Sargon. and Shalmaneser, the latter of whom took Samaria, after a three years' siege, and carried the people captive to Assyria, in 721 B.C., replacing them by foreign colonists. This explains how it was that Josiah was able to desecrate the northern sanctuaries, and slay their priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-20.htm" title="And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burned men's bones on them, and returned to Jerusalem.">2Kings 23:20</a>). The ordinary Hebrew text divides the word thus: <span class= "ital">behar b-tthehem,</span> so as to suggest the reading <span class= "ital">behar b-tthehem,</span> "in the hill of their houses." The LXX. has "in their places round about"; the Vulg. omits the phrase; and the Syriac reads "in their streets around." The whole verse should be connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-7.htm" title="And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 34:7</a>, thus: "And in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, to wit, in their ruins round about, he pulled down the altars and the Asherim; and the carven images he dashed into pieces unto pulverising." <span class= "ital">Hedaq</span> is an unusual form of the infinitive, not a perfect, as Bertheau supposes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the cities of Manasseh,...

Happy and wise are those who seek the Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah, from your youth? Oh the unspeakable happiness of becoming acquainted with Jesus from our earliest years!</body></html>
