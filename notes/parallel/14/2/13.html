The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11, 16</a> would invest these with suspicion, if nothing that occurred before did, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 14, 40</a>). There can be no doubt from these passages that the name Huram of this verse is the name of the workman sent (the <span class="accented">lamed</span> prefixed being only the objective sign), not the supposed name of King Hiram's father, which, as already seen, was Abibaal. But the following word translated "my father" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is less easily explained; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16</a> ("<span class="accented">his</span> father") is quite sufficient to negative the rendering" father" altogether. In our text altogether inappropriate, it may be called there altogether impossible. It has been proposed to render it as a proper name <span class="accented">Abi</span>, or as an affix of honour, <span class="accented">Ab</span>, equal to "master." However, Gesenius (in '<span class="accented">Lexicon</span>,' <span class="accented">sub roe.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;</span> (6), which see) furnishes a signification, "chief counsellor," which (taking it to mean chief counsellor, or as it were expert, chief referee, or even only <span class="accented">foreman</span> in such matters as might be in question) would well suit all the passages, and remove all difficulty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-18 Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram. - Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.</body></html>
