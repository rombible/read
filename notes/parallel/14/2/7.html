By comparison of ver. 3, it appears that Solomon makes of Hiram's services to David his father a very plea why his own requests addressed now to Hiram should be granted. If we may be guided by the <span class="accented">form</span> of the expressions used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11, 12</a>, Hiram had in the first instance volunteered help to David, and had not waited to be applied to by David. This would show us more clearly the force of Solomon's plea. Further, if we note the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>, we may be disposed to think that it fills a gap in our present connection, and indicates that, though Solomon appears here to have had to take the initiative, an easy opportunity was opened, in the courteous embassy sent him in the persons of Hiram's "servants." That the king of this most privileged, separate, and exclusive people of Israel (and <span class="accented">he</span> the one who conducted that people to the very zenith of their fame) should have to apply and be permitted to apply to foreign and, so to say, heathen help, in so intrinsic a matter as the finding of the "cunning" and the "skill" of head and hand for the most sacred and distinctive <span class="accented">chef d'oeuvre</span> of the said exclusive nation, is a grand instance of nature breaking all trammels, even when most divinely purposed, and a grand token of the dawning comity of nations, of free-trade under the unlikeliest auspices, and of the brotherhood of humanity, never more broadly illustrated than when on an international scale. The competence of the Phoenicians and the people of Sidon and those over whom Hiram immediately reigned in the working of the metals, and furthermore in a very wide range of other subjects, is well sustained by the allusions of very various authorities (already instanced under 1 Chronicles 14:1, and <span class="accented">passim</span>; Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:289-294; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:614; 15:415-426; Herod., 3:19; 7:23, 44, 96; Strabo, 16:2. &sect; 23). The man who was sent is described in vers. 13, 14, <span class="accented">infra</span>, as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Purple, ... crimson, ... blue</span>. It is not absolutely necessary to suppose that the same Hiram, so skilled in working of gold, silver, brass, and iron, was <span class="accented">the</span> authority sent for these matters of various coloured dyes for the cloths that would later on be required for curtains and other similar purposes in the temple. So far, indeed, as the literal construction of the words go, this would seem to be what is meant, and no doubt <span class="accented">may</span> have been the case, though unlikely. The <span class="accented">purple</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). A Chaldee form of this word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) occurs three times in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7, 16, 29</a>, and appears in each of those cases in our Authorized Version as "scarlet." Neither of these words is the word used in the numerous passages of Exodus, Numbers, Judges, Esther, Proverbs, Canticles, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, nor, indeed, in ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. In all these places, numbering nearly forty, the word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. The purple was probably obtained from some shell-fish on the coast of the Mediterranean. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). Gesenius says that this was a colour obtained from multitudinous insects that tenanted one kind of the flex (<span class="accented">Coccus ilicis</span>), and that the word is from the Persian language. The Persian <span class="accented">kerm</span>, Sanscrit <span class="accented">krimi</span>, Armenian <span class="accented">karmir</span>, German <span class="accented">carmesin</span>, and our own "crimson," keep the same framework of letters or sound to a remarkable degree. This word is found only here, ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>, and the <span class="accented">scarlet</span> of some forty places in the Pentateuch and other books, come as the rendering of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The <span class="accented">blue</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>). This is the same word as is used in some fifty other passages in Exodus, Numbers, and in later books. This colour was obtained from a shell-fish (<span class="accented">Helix ianthina</span>) found in the Mediterranean, the shell of which was blue. <span class="cmt_word">Can skill to grave</span>. The word "to grave" is the piel conjugation of the very familiar Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, "to open." Out of twenty-nine times that the verb occurs in some part of the piel conjugation, it is translated "grave" nine times, "loosed" eleven times, "put off" twice, "ungirded" once, "opened" four times, "appear" once, and "go free" once. Perhaps the "opening" the ground with the plough (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24</a>) leads most easily on to the idea of "engraving." <span class="cmt_word">Cunning men whom... David... did</span> provide, As we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-15.htm">1 Chronicles 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-21.htm">1 Chronicles 28:21</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-18 Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram. - Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.</body></html>
