The Hebrew word is the ordinary word for "said;" as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the expression of such frequent occurrence, "The Lord said." Its natural equivalent here might be, he <span class="accented">gave the word</span>, or <span class="accented">issued the command</span>, for the building of a house. <span class="cmt_word">For the Name of the Lord</span>; better, to <span class="accented">the Name of the Lord</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-3.htm">1 Kings 5:3</a>; or in Hebrew text, 5:18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm">1 Chronicles 22:7</a>). The expression," the Name of the Lord," is of very early date (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>). A name named upon a person at the first purported as far as possible to mark his <span class="accented">nature</span>, either its <span class="accented">tout ensemble</span> or some striking attribute of it. Hence the changed name, sometimes of Divine interposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10</a>); and much more noticeably the alterations of the Divine Name, to serve and to mark the progressive development of the revelation of God to man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). So the <span class="accented">Name of the Lord</span> stands ever - monogram most sacred - for himself. <span class="cmt_word">A house for</span> <span class="cmt_word">his</span> <span class="cmt_word">kingdom;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. a</span> royal residence for Solomon himself. This is mere clearly expressed as, "in his own house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-1.htm">2 Chronicles 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10, 15</a>). The description of this house for himself is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1-13</a>. But no parallel account exists in Chronicles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-18 Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram. - Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.</body></html>
