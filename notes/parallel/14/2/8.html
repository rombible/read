The desire to be concise has betrayed him into an inaccuracy of statement. Or must we suppose that Solomon himself believed that the sandal wood, which he only knew as a Phoenician export, really grew, like the cedars and firs, on the Lebanon? Such a mistake would be perfectly natural; but the divergence of this account from the parallel in 1 Kings leaves it doubtful whether we have in either anything more than an ideal sketch of Solomon's message.<p><span class= "bld">For I know that thy servants</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Comp. the words of Solomon as reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm" title="Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.">1Kings 5:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Algum trees, out of Lebanon</span>. These trees are called <span class="accented">algum</span> in the three passages of Chronicles in which the tree is mentioned, viz. here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10, 11</a>, but in the three passages of Kings, <span class="accented">almug</span>, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11, 12</a> <span class="accented">bis.</span> As we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10, 11</a>, that they were exports from Ophir, we are arrested by the expression, "out of Lebanon," here. If they were accessible in Lebanon, it is not on the face of it to be supposed they would be ordered from such a distance as Ophir. Lastly, there is very great difference of opinion as to what the tree was in itself. In Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. 3. appendix, p. 6, the subject is discussed more fully than it can be here, and with some of its scientific technicalities. Celsius has mentioned fifteen woods for which the honour has been claimed. More modern disputants have suggested five, of these the red sandalwood being considered, perhaps, the likeliest. So great an authority as Dr. Hooker pronounces that it is a question quite undetermined. But inasmuch as it is so undetermined, it would seem possible that, if it were a precious wood of the smaller kind (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ebony with us), and, so to say, of shy growth in Lebanon, it might be that it did grow in Lebanon, but that a very insufficient supply of it there was customarily supplemented by the imports received from Ophir. Or, again, it may be that the words, "out of Lebanon," are simply misplaced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a>), and should follow the words, "fir trees." The rendering "pillars" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a> for "rails" or "props" is unfortunate, as the other quoted uses of the wood for "harps" and "psalteries" would all betoken a <span class="accented">small</span> as well as very hard wood. Lastly, it is a suggestion of Canon Rawlinson that, inasmuch as the almug wood of Ophir came <span class="accented">via</span> Phoenicia and Hiram, Solomon may very possibly have been ignorant that "Lebanon" was not its proper <span class="accented">habitat. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy servants can skill to cut timber</span>. This same testimony is expressed yet more strongly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, "There is not any among us that can skill to hew timber like the Sidoniaus." Passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>, go to show that the verb employed in our text is rightly rendered "hew," as referring to the <span class="accented">felling</span> rather than to any subsequent dressing and sawing up of the timber. It is, therefore, rather more a point of interest to learn in <span class="accented">what</span> the great skill consisted which so threw Israelites into the shade, while distinguishing Hiram's servants. It is, of course<span class="cmt_word">,</span> quite possible that the "hewing," or "felling," may be taken to <span class="accented">infer</span> all the subsequent cutting, dressing, etc. Perhaps the skill intended will have included the best selection of trees, as well as the neatest and quickest laying of them prostrate, and if beyond this it included the sawing and dressing and shaping of the wood, the room for superiority of skill would be ample. <span class="cmt_word">My servants</span> (so vers. 2, 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-18 Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram. - Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.</body></html>
