From Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 2, 8) it would appear that some record of the negotiations between Huram and Solomon was still extant at Tyre in his day, if only we might trust his authority.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joppa</span>, This was one of the most ancient of towns, and is referred to by Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 5:13), as "Joppa Phoenicum, antiquior terrarum inundatione, ut ferunt." Its name (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;</span>, "beauty") is said to have been justified by the beautiful groves in its neighbourhood. It is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a> as Japho, where also we learn the circumstances under which the Dan tribe were possessed of it. It is remarkable that it is not mentioned again till our present verse, not even in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>). But it appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>, and in several places in the Acts of the Apostles.

The carriage of the tim-bet this road-journey is nowhere described in detail, nor is the exact spot of the coast west of Lebanon mentioned where the flotes were made, and thence despatched. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-18 Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram. - Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.</body></html>
