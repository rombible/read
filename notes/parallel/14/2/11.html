In the parallel of Kings an identical expression is used for the communications of both: "Solomon sent to Hiram" (ver. 2), and "Hiram sent to Solomon" (ver. 8). The productions of the forms of this correspondence by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:2)and Eupolemus ('Ap. Praep. Evang.,' 9:33) are, of course, merely mythical. <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord hath loved his people.</span> This beautiful expression has parallels, not only in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>; but in such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-12.htm">Psalm 115:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 4</a>. These were all precursors of the fuller assertion and kinder demonstration of God's love repeated so often and in such tender connections in the Epistles of the New Testament. This verse and the following are also testimony to the indirect influences on surrounding nations of the knowledge of the one true Creator-God and Ruler-God, that was domiciled by special revelation and oracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>) with Israel. Where nations near were bitter foes, they often feared Israel's God, whereas now they were friends they could summon to their lips the highest of the outbursts of praise, not to say of adoration. The very noteworthy sympathy of Hiram with Israel may have owed something to his personal predilection for David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>). And <span class="accented">this</span> again is convincing testimony to the worth and usefulness of individual character which here influenced the destiny of two whole nations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-18 Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram. - Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.</body></html>
