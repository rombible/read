Probably he was one of "the sons of the concubines" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="These were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister.">1Chronicles 3:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And Abihail.</span>--The <span class= "ital">and</span> is not in the present Hebrew text, but is supplied by the LXX.

The word <span class="cmt_word">daughter</span> here is a correction of the Keri, the Chethiv having been "son," This <span class="cmt_word">Jerimoth</span> is the seventh out of a list of eight men of the same name mentioned in the two books of Chronicles. He is not given as one of the children of David's proper wives in either <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-8</a> or 1 Chronicles 14:4-7; Jerome says it was the Jewish tradition that he was the son of a concubine of David. It is just possible that Jerimoth and Ithream were two names of the same person. <span class="cmt_word">Abihail</span> was second cousin of Mahalath. It is not quite clear whether Abihail were wife of Jerimoth and mother of Mahalath, or a second wife now mentioned of Rehoboam. The contents of the next verse not differencing the children there mentioned, and assigning her own to each wife of Rehoboam, if these were two wives of his, favours the former supposition (our Hebrew text being "and she <span class="accented">bare</span>," not "which bare"). When it is said that Abthail was the daughter of <span class="cmt_word">Eliab</span>, the meaning probably is, as again in ver. 20, granddaughter. (For Eliab, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:13-23 When the priests and Levites came to Jerusalem, the devout, pious Israelites followed them. Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel, left the inheritance of their fathers, and went to Jerusalem, that they might have free access to the altar of God, and be out of the temptation to worship the calves. That is best for us, which is best for our souls; in all our choices, religious advantages must be sought before all outward conveniences. Where God's faithful priests are, his faithful people should be. And when it has been proved that we are willing to renounce our worldly interests, so far as we are called to do so for the sake of Christ and his gospel, we have good evidence that we are truly his disciples. And it is the interest of a nation to protect religion and religious people.</body></html>
