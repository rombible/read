Even if it be not permissible to render <span class= "ital">meth</span> "dying," we cannot agree with the suggestion of Thenius that the account of Chronicles is simply an arbitrary alteration of the older narrative for the sake of literary effect.

We still find no note whatever of blame attributed to Josiah, and the general mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>) appears to have been most genuine. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:20-27 The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh. Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them. Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct, we should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable to our profession.</body></html>
