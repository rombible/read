And king Josias burnt those who had in them a divining spirit, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and the sodomites which were in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law that were written in the book which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord. There was no <i>king</i> like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and all his soul, and all his strength, according to all the law of Moses, and after him there rose up none like him. Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the anger of his fierce wrath, wherewith the Lord was greatly angry against Juda, for all the provocations wherewith Manasses provoked him: and the Lord said, I will even remove Juda also from my presence, as I have removed Israel, and I have rejected the city which I chose, <i>even</i> Jerusalem, and thehouse of which I said, My name shall be there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/drb/2_chronicles/35.htm">Douay-Rheims Bible</a></span><br />In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this phase celebrated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/dbt/2_chronicles/35.htm">Darby Bible Translation</a></span><br />In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover holden.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/erv/2_chronicles/35.htm">English Revised Version</a></span><br />In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/wbt/2_chronicles/35.htm">Webster's Bible Translation</a></span><br />In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/web/2_chronicles/35.htm">World English Bible</a></span><br />In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ylt/2_chronicles/35.htm">Young's Literal Translation</a></span><br /> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah hath this passover been made.</div></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheadingv"><b>Study Bible</b></div><span class="hdg"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/2_chronicles/35.htm">Josiah Restores the Passover</a></span><br>&#8230;<span class="reftext">18</span>No such Passover had been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet.

God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.</body></html>
