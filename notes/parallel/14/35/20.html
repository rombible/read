So LXX. here.

An inscription of Assurbanipal gives a list of twenty subject kings appointed by Esarhaddon his father to bear rule in Egypt, the first name in the list being that of <span class= "ital">"Nik- sar ali Mimpi u ali Saa," i.e.,</span> "Necho, king of the city of Memphis, and the city of Sais." Assurbanipal twice reinstated this Necho (Necho I., circ. 664 B.C. ) after vanquishing Tirhakah.<p>The Necho of our text is Necho II., who reigned circ. 610 B.C. (See the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Against Charchemish.</span>--<span class= "ital">At Charchemish.</span> Syriac and Arabic, "to assault Mab-g," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Hierapolis.

(Saracus), the last of the rulers of Nineveh; not Nabopalassar, king of Babylon, for the Assyrian empire had not yet fallen before the united assault of the Medes and the Babylonians. Charchemish has been identified with the modern <span class= "ital">Jirbas,</span> on the western bank of the middle Euphrates. Its situation, as Schrader observes, suits an intended expedition against Nineveh and Assyria, rather than against Babylon. It was one of the great Hittite capitals, and inscriptions in hieroglyphics, similar to those of Hamath, have recently been disinterred on the site, and brought thence to the British Museum. The name means, "Fortress of Mish." Comp. "Mesha" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-30.htm" title="And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go to Sephar a mount of the east.">Genesis 10:30</a>), the Assyrian <span class= "ital">Masu, i.e.,</span> the part of the Syrian desert which ran along the right bank of the Euphrates.

The chronicler, therefore, has derived the details of the following verses from another source (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/35-21.htm" title="But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear you from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy you not.">2Chronicles 35:21-25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After all this</span>. A period of about thirteen years of happy retrospect is now the portion of the good king. This period brings itself to an unhappy and even fatal termination in the year <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>; when, as it would appear by the result, King Josiah did wrong, and went out of his way, in opposing the march of Pharaoh-Necho (who reigned <span class="date">B.C. 611-595</span>), successor of Psammetichus King of Egypt, against Cyaxares (the monarch who, with Nabo-polassar, had taken Nineveh, <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>) King of <span class="accented">Assyria</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), or King of Babylon at <span class="accented">Circesium on the River Phrat</span>, the head-quarters now of the united Assyrian and Babylonian power. Where the fault or sin of Josiah lay - whether he ran before he was sent, or whether, according to our following two verses, he set out <span class="accented">against</span> the Divine word by Necho - is certainly a question left in obscurity. Nothing is said in our history or its parallel to accredit the tale of Necho, or to discredit the heart and motive of Josiah - nothing <span class="accented">except</span> what silence and the result <span class="accented">seem</span> to say. One other clement of interest and of difficulty may be added to the question; for of the thirteen years' interval, which we have described above as one presumably of happy retrospect in certain aspects for Josiah, we know nothing from Scripture, but have <span class="accented">every</span> reason to suppose that during it Josiah and his kingdom had become subject, if only nominally, to Nabopolassar; so that, in offering to resist Necho of Egypt, he was offering to strengthen so far forth the royal line which did dishonour to his own country and his country's God. Upon this supposition, however, we can lay no stress. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:20-27 The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh. Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them. Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct, we should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable to our profession.</body></html>
