So did the Assyrians, as abundantly appears from their inscriptions. So, too, we read on the Moabite stone, "Chemosh said unto me, Go; take Nebo . . . Go up against Horonaim, and take it." These facts sufficiently explain the text, without assuming that Necho had received an oracle <span class= "ital">from Jehovah,</span> or was referring to the God of Israel. (Comp.

Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them. Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct, we should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable to our profession.</body></html>
