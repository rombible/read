but put you on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.">2Chronicles 18:29</a>). The LXX. reads, "he strengthened himself," or "persisted" (<span class= "greekheb">??????????</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> (Comp. 3 Esdr. 1:28.) This implies the reading <span class= "ital">hithchazzaq</span> instead of <span class= "ital">hithchappesh.</span> It is wholly unlikely that "disguised himself" is used in the figurative sense of "departed from his true cha racter," as Keil and Z�ckler think.<p><span class= "bld">The words of Necho from the mouth of God.</span>--The warning of Necho was really divine, as the event proved.

Herodotus (ii. 159) calls the place Magdolus.

It is indeed possible that they might purport, from the pen of the writer of Chronicles, that in point of fact the words of Necho had been the permitted warning, though not the actually dictated language of God. The genius of the whole passage strongly reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-17.htm">2 Chronicles 25:17, 19-21</a>; and its parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of Megiddo</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among those hills which separate the country of the coast from Esdraelon - a valley as that "of Kishon" (see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 356, 339, 347; but see also Conder's 'Handbook,' p. 287, where a different view is taken). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:20-27 The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh. Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them. Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct, we should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable to our profession.</body></html>
