The removal probably took place under Manasseh or his son, with the object of saving the sacred symbol from profanation. Or perhaps the repair of the Temple under Josiah had necessitated such a step. A third explanation takes the words in the sense of "Let the ark be, where it stands, in its proper place. Do not give a thought to your ancient function of bearing it about; but set your minds upon present duties." This, however, is too artificial.<p><span class= "bld">It shall not be a burden.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">hearing on the shoulder is not for you.</span> (Comp. the like statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-26.htm" title="And also to the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.">1Chronicles 23:26</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-15.htm" title="And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.

We can only conjecture why the ark was not in its proper place, probably having been temporarily removed during Josiah's own restorations, or possibly having never been yet replaced from the date of some earlier removal of an iniquitous character and on the part of an iniquitous king. Secondly, as to the burden, some would explain the language as a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of the general and ever-applicable principle found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a>. This, at any rate, would seem rather more satisfactory than the suggestion conveyed by the italic type of our Authorized Version. Perhaps the explanation may rather be that the ark had latterly again and again been shifted, and Josiah wishes to protest that neither for one reason nor another shall it be again moved. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-19 The destruction Josiah made of idolatry, was more largely related in the book of Kings. His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.</body></html>
