For it was kept on the proper day in the first month, and was not a mere supplementary Passover; it was observed with due regularity, and not by worshippers some of whom were unclean; and if we allow thirteen persons for each lamb or kid, there were upwards of half a million communicants; while, so far as we know, there were only seventeen thousand sheep presented by Hezekiah and his princes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-24.htm">2 Chronicles 30:24</a>), which would not supply more than half the number of partakers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-19 The destruction Josiah made of idolatry, was more largely related in the book of Kings. His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.</body></html>
