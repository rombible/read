<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-23.htm" title="And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.">2Chronicles 11:23</a>). These latter, as well as the generals of the forces, are called the king's "ministers" (<span class= "ital">m?sh?r?thim</span>)--a word which is not used of service in the field, but implies their presence at court ("in Jerusalem," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-13.htm" title="And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 17:13</a>, as the royal staff).<p>According to the above list, the army of Jehoshaphat was organised in five grand divisions, corresponding perhaps to five territorial divisions of the southern kingdom. The totals are the largest assigned to the two tribes anywhere in the Old Testament; viz., Judah 780,000, and Benjamin 380,000; in all, 1,160,000. At David's census Judah had 500,000 warriors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.">2Samuel 24:9</a>); and Israel 800,000. Again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm" title="And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.">2Chronicles 14:8</a>, Asa's army consists of 300,000 men of Judah and 280,000 Benjaminites: clearly such an increase as our text indicates is unaccountable. At the same time, it is equally clear that the present numbers are not fortuitous results of clerical errors, for they follow each other in the order of relative strength: Judah, 300,000, 280,000, 200,000; Benjamin, 200,000, 180,000; and they are evidently not independent of the estimates of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm" title="And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.">2Chronicles 14:8</a> above quoted.<p>In the absence of adequate data for modifying these certainly startling figures, it is well to bear in mind that we need not understand by them an army which ever actually mustered in the field or on parade, but simply an estimate of the total male population liable to be called out for the national defence; although, even upon that understanding, the total appears to be at least three times too great, considering the small extent of the country.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These waited</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, plur. piel part. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. The verse states that this enormous fivefold army, with its five princes (counting, in our corrupt text, one million one hundred and sixty thousand), was the king's Jerusalem standing army, while other separate regiments or bands of troops were spread through all Judah, where they might be most needed for defence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-19 Jehoshaphat promotes religion in Judah, His prosperity. - Jehoshaphat found his people generally very ignorant, and therefore endeavoured to have them well taught. The public teaching of the word of God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power of godliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience is awakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat's prosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained the neighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but the fear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed his country, and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of God are more the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers and weapons of war. The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God in every event, yet this is little regarded. But let all employ the talents they have: be faithful, even in that which is little. Set up the worship of God in your houses. The charge of a family is important. Why should you not instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, in the book of the law of the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommend one thing, and practise another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to the Lord God of Israel, then call upon children and servants to follow your example.</body></html>
