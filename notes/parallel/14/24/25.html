But it is not said that Joash himself was wounded, but only that the destruction of his princes and the defeat of his army were judgments upon him. The word rendered "diseases" (<span class= "ital">mah?l-yim</span>) only occurs here; but it is obviously a near synonym of the term used of the last sickness of Jehoram (<span class= "ital">tah?l-'im,</span> 2chron xxi, 19), and the probable meaning is "pains," or "suffering." Calamity may have brought about the sickness of Joash, or perhaps the invasion had come upon him when already prostrate with disease, and unable to resist in person.<p><span class= "bld">His own servants conspired against him.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm" title="And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.">2Kings 12:20</a>, "And his servants arose and made a conspiracy."

And when he died, he said, The LORD look on it, and require it.">2Chronicles 24:22</a>), and the plural <span class= "ital">may</span> be due to a transcriber's mistake. More probably it is used <span class= "ital">rhetorically,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-16.htm" title="At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him.">2Chronicles 28:16</a>, and elsewhere.<p>The writer does not mean to say that revenge for the death of Jehoiada's posterity was the motive which actuated the conspirators, but that their deed was a judgment upon the king for that crime.

But nothing is there said of the sickness of Joash, and his being murdered in his bed.<p><span class= "bld">But they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-20.htm" title="Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. However, they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.">2Chronicles 21:20</a>, where the same remark is made about the burial of Jehoram.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They left him in great diseases</span>. See note above, and observe further that this parenthetic clause, as treated in both Authorized Version and Revised Version, prepares the way for what follows, and especially for the fact that it was <span class="cmt_word">on his bed that they slew him</span>. Render thus, <span class="accented">And after they had betaken themselves away, whereas they left him sorely ill, his own servants conspired</span>... <span class="accented">and slew him in his</span> bed. <span class="cmt_word">His own servants</span>. These had the opportunity the rather at hand, in that he was so ill and in bed. That he died by the conspiring together of a couple of servants, whose foreign and heathen maternity is particularly recorded, was the more ignominious end for him, who had commanded Zechariah to be openly stoned - a death highly honourable in comparison. The parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>) adds that it was in "the house of Mille, which goeth down to Silla" (for the explanation of which passage, see note <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>), that the servants' conspiracy to kill Joash took effect. The sons of Jehoiada. We know of only one son, Zechariah; there may have been other sons, or other lineal relations of Jehoiada may be covered by the word "sons." We are not obliged to interpret the avenging act of the servants as one to which their own pious and patriotic zeal led them, which, considering their maternal pedigree, is perhaps something unlikely, though of course not impossible, but one to which they were incited by the retributive providence of him who held their hearts also in his hand. In a word, it was a deed done for the <span class="accented">bleed - required</span> (see note and references under ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">Not in the sepulchres of the kings</span>. See note on ver. 16, and references there quoted; as also the ambiguous expression of the parallel (ver. 21), "They <span class="accented">buried him with his fathers in</span> the city of David." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly, zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.</body></html>
