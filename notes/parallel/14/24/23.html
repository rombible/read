Our passage seems to show that a small part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-24.htm" title="For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear.

The princes of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm" title="Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.">2Chronicles 24:17</a>) at the head of a large force met the invaders in the field; but the Syrians routed them, and "destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people." We may suppose that they made it their special aim to cut off the leaders of the Jewish host. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-30.htm" title="Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight you not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.">2Chronicles 18:30</a>.) Thus the apostate princes were overtaken by the prophetic doom.

The versions, of course, express correctly what is meant, but probably the season of spring is also conveyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-1.htm">1 Chronicles 20:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host of Syria</span>. Their king was Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17</a>), whether actually with them is perhaps not certain, but the last clause in the verse just quoted would seem to convey that impression. He was King of <span class="accented">Damascus</span> (Aram, or Syria), and having already temporarily mastered Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3, 4, 22</a>), the way was paved to Gath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>), whence wistful eyes were bent on Jerusalem, nearly thirty miles distant thence. <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed all the princes of the people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">And sent all the spoil</span>. Whether intended so here or not, probably the strict subject of the verb in this clause is Joash and his counsellors (ver. 18 in parallel), in their fright - and just fright - helpless after the slaughter chronicled in our following verse, bribing off Hazael and his host, as in parallel. The suggestion is most plausible that tidings of Zechariah's martyrdom and of the occasion of it were the very incentive to Hazael's incursion, and an illustration of the "means" by which God works, and by which he wrought his purpose in this instance. <span class="cmt_word">The spoil of them</span>. If this means only the spoil of the defeated army strictly, then our text gives no trace of the contents of ver. 18 in parallel just alluded to; but the frequent dislocation incident to copied extracts and matter borrowed from original sources, and so often evidenced in the present history, when we have been comparing the two derived accounts to which we are indebted for it, incline us to the above view, as one quite open at any rate to possibility. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly, zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.</body></html>
