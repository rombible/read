It serves as a moral explanation of the after-history of Joash, recorded there and here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2Kings 12:17-21</a>).<p>(15) <span class= "bld">But Jehoiada . . . when he died.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And Jehoiada became old, and was satisfied with days, and he died.</span> The <span class= "ital">verb</span> "to be satisfied" is only so used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-1.htm" title="So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.">1Chronicles 23:1</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-16.htm" title="With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.">Psalm 91:16</a>.) The ancient expression was adjectival, "full of days" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm" title="And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-17.htm" title="So Job died, being old and full of days.">Job 42:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-28.htm" title="And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.">1Chronicles 29:28</a>, only).<p><span class= "bld">An hundred and thirty years old.</span>--According to some modern physiologists, one hundred and five is the proper limit of human life; that is to say, five times the period usually required for the attainment of full growth. Under favourable conditions it is even supposed that life might extend to half a century longer (M. Flourens, of the French Academy of Sciences). When persons of advanced age (eighty to one hundred) die, it is usually from preventible causes, As a French medical writer has remarked, "Men do not commonly die; they kill themselves." The ago of Jehoiada, then, would seem to be not impossible, although an error of transcription in our text is also not impossible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jehoiada... died; an hundred and thirty years old</span>. This good man, husband of Jehoram's daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>), only comes to view in virtue of what his wife did, and what he did,; on behalf of Joash the infant and Joash the king for the good of the nation or kingdom of Judah. We seem to know too little of him, and the parallel supplies considerably less than our text in Chronicles. His age, as stated in this verse when he died, seems very improbable, and for a very clear and admirable putting of the case, see Lord Arthur C. Hervey's article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:944. There is, however, no manifest or even suspicious symptom of corruptness in the text just here, supported as it is by the Septuagint and Josephus, by the stress laid on his old age, whether it showed a hundred and thirty years, or thirty years or fifty years (as have been variously suggested) fewer; the little fact, otherwise looking very significant, that the expression, <span class="cmt_word">full of days</span>, is used beside only of Abraham, Isaac, Job, and <span class="accented">David</span>, loses its pertinence in that very circumstance that it <span class="accented">is</span> used of David, whose age was in no way extreme. The age of the other three, however, exceeded this reputed age given to Jehoiada! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly, zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.</body></html>
