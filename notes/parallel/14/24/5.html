The priests and Levites of the different districts were to collect the moneys due to the sanctuary, each in his own neighbourhood.<p><span class= "bld">And see that ye hasten the matter.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and, for your part, hasten ye in regard to the matter</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-8.htm" title="And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.">2Chronicles 18:8</a>); <span class= "ital">and the Levites hastened not.</span> This agrees with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-6.htm" title="But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.">2Kings 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-9.htm" title="But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.">2Kings 12:9</a> : "And it was so, <span class= "ital">that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash</span> the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house." The remissness of the priestly order is evidently inferable from these words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To repair</span>. The idea of this verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>) is that of <span class="accented">making strong. <span class="cmt_word"></span>From year to year</span>. The compound adverbial expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, here used for "from," era-braces the idea of" unfailingly from year to year." The command given here to the priests and Levites is expressed very differently, though in no degree contadictorily, in the parallel (see its vers. 4, 5). The addition is there found, "every man of his acquaintance;" this expression may glance at the very supposable circumstance that the priest and Levite collecting deputations would naturally go respectively to the towns and cities where they had been located beforetime. A slight ambiguity is perhaps occasioned by the impression that the fourth verse (in the parallel) produces - that the priests and Levites should wait to <span class="accented">receive, e.g.</span>, in Jerusalem. This, however, is sot what is <span class="accented">said</span>, and need not, therefore, be made into a difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the Levites hastened not.</span> We are not told <span class="accented">why</span> this delay was, nor does the subsequent narrative seem to elucidate it, further than this - that the delay somehow seemed to rest with Jehoiada, as the king appealed to him for explanation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 Joash is more zealous about the repair of the temple than Jehoiada himself. It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. But the repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which all should promote. And many a good work would be done that now lies undone, if active men would put it forward.</body></html>
