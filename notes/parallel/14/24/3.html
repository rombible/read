Our <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a> leaves it probable that "Jehoaden of Jerusalem" was one of these, though it is likely enough that Joash married, whether her or some one else, <span class="accented">before</span> he had reached the age of twenty-one. It is also quite likely that we may read between the lines, that in selecting <span class="accented">two</span> wives for his young and loved ward, Jehoiada hoped and prayed that Joash might not fall by sin like Solomon's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>) and that of others of the kings of both Judah and Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 Joash is more zealous about the repair of the temple than Jehoiada himself. It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. But the repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which all should promote. And many a good work would be done that now lies undone, if active men would put it forward.</body></html>
