Literally, <span class= "ital">For with fewness of men had the host of Syria come, and Jehovah had given into their hand a host in exceeding abundance.</span> "Fewness of men" (<span class= "ital">mic'ar 'an?shim</span>) is a phrase not found elsewhere. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-20.htm" title="Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.">Genesis 19:20</a>.) The parallel account informs us that Hazael had intended to march against Jerusalem in person, as it would seem, after the battle in which the Syrian division had defeated the Jewish princes. Joash, however, bribed his for bearance by a present of the treasures of the Temple and palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.">2Kings 12:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So they executed judgment against Joash.</span>--A phrase always used of Divine requital. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm" title="For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm" title="Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the middle of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.">Ezekiel 5:10</a>.) (The construction here is unique: "they did judgments <span class= "ital">with</span> Joash," whereas the ordinary form would be, "they did judgments <span class= "ital">in</span> Joash." )<p>As compared with Kings, the present narrative regards the Syrian invasion from a prophetic and religious point of view, and, therefore, while it omits certain details which are there clearly specified, it is careful to mention such facts as most vividly point its moral, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the destruction of the idolatrous princes, and the rout of "a great host" by the attack of "a small company."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came with a small company... the Lord delivered</span> <span class="cmt_word">a very great host</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">So they executed judgment against Joash</span>. The Hebrew says literally, "and on Joash they executed judgments." What the judgments were we do not read, but surely it is probable that they are glanced at in the next verse, "For they left him in great [or, 'many'] diseases," or perhaps "in great illness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-15.htm">2 Chronicles 21:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly, zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.</body></html>
