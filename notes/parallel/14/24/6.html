In consequence, "the priests obeyed so as not to take money from the people, and not to repair the breaches of the house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-8.htm" title="And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.">2Kings 12:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiada the chief</span>; so. <span class="accented">priest</span>, for comp. our ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>. In each of those instances the Hebrew text shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and the Authorized Version "chief" except inconsistently in our ver. 11. Revised Version "chief" in all the instances. The name "priest" occurs just about six hundred and sixty-six times in the Old Testament, the title "high" or "chief priest" only about twenty-six times, the first occurrence being in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, the last <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>; and both set forth by the Hebrew adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, as also in fifteen other of the occurrences. Seven times the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is the word employed, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>the other two times. In these last two cases, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-24.htm">Ezra 8:24, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>), it is not "high priests" nor "chief priests" that are perhaps even really intended, but the "princes" of the priests, or those who, for whatever reasons of personal characteristics, were <span class="accented">chief. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Out of Judah and out of Jerusalem</span>. The statement here is precise, that the call of money was to be made both in the cities of Judah and in the metropolis Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">collection</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; Revised Version, better, <span class="accented">the tax of, etc.</span> Of this we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-30.htm">Numbers 1:30</a>. It was of the <span class="accented">uniform</span> amount of half a sanctuary shekel, for rich or poor, and was ordered to be set apart "for the service of the <span class="accented">tabernacle of the conregation</span>," here called in the Authorized Version <span class="cmt_word">the tabernacle of witness</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the tent of the testimony.</span> Exodus has <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> for our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>. This source of money for the holy design of Joash is again most specifically stated in our ver. 9. The version of this whole transaction seems rather confusing as given in the parallel, where ver. 4 mentions three sources of money, without any quotation as such of the ordained tax of Moses, which was apparently the first of those three, and where ver. 8, at first blush at any rate, might seem to imply <span class="accented">recusant</span> priests. The meaning, however, is probably the contrary, the verse purporting that the priests consented to forego what they had been accustomed on receiving to apply to some personal or current-funds purpose, and who consented to forego the superintending of the outlay of the money on. the repairing, that it might be done with more expedition by "scribe" and high priest" (ver. 10; comp. ver. 16; both of the parallel). All these details the writer of Chronicles passes over, only pursuing the essential business, Joash's pious resolve, the delay in its execution, and how he finally overcame the obstructive delay. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 Joash is more zealous about the repair of the temple than Jehoiada himself. It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. But the repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which all should promote. And many a good work would be done that now lies undone, if active men would put it forward.</body></html>
