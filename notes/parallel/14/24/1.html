The references <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a> and Genesis 26:18, 31-33 are full of interest, as bearing on the way in which the spot is first known in Bible history. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-14 Joash is more zealous about the repair of the temple than Jehoiada himself.
