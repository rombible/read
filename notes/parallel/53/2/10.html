"They did not receive," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, it was offered them, and they refused it; not, as Calvinism would teach, because it was not given them. The grace of <span class= "ital">love</span> of the truth is offered us along with every new presentment of truth; if we are too indolent to examine whether it be truth, we are rejecting the <span class= "ital">love</span> of the truth. This is a worse thing than not accepting the truth itself: if they had only aspired to know what <span class= "ital">was</span> the truth they would have been saved, even if, in fact, they had been in error.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">with all deceit of unrighteousness</span> (R.V.); either with all deceit leading to unrighteousness or with all deceit which is unrighteousness. The man of sin works by deceit and falsehood; and by means of imposture and wonders and high pretensions he will succeed in imposing on the world. The energetic power of the man of sin is, however, by no means irresistible; only they who perish will succumb to it. <span class="cmt_word">In them.</span> In the best manuscripts the preposition "in" is wanting; therefore the words are to be translated <span class="accented">for them</span> or <span class="accented">to them. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That perish</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>); <span class="cmt_word">because they received not the love of the truth.</span> Not only did they not receive the truth when it was offered them, but, what was worse, they were destitute even of a love of the truth. By the truth here is meant, not Christ himself, as some expositors think, but primarily the Christian truth, and secondarily the truth generally. There was in them a want of susceptibility for the truth, and thus not only were they prevented embracing the gospel, but they were led astray by numerous errors and delusions. <span class="cmt_word">That they might be saved.</span> The result which naturally would arise from the reception of the truth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-12 Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.</body></html>
