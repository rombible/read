This shaking and trouble probably brought about the disorders spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 3. The instruments by which men had partly driven the Thessalonians out of their wits already were three:--(1) "Through spirit," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by pretended manifestations of the Holy Spirit's power, whether through false signs or, more probably, through "prophesyings." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm" title="Despise not prophesyings.">1Thessalonians 5:20-22</a>, where the fear of some abuse of prophecy is clearly marked already.) (2) "Through word," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Word of mouth, as opposed to the written letter next mentioned. Most modern commentators seem rightly to take the words "as from us" with this clause as well as with the next; some persons misrepresented what they had heard the Apostles say on the topic, or pretended to have been intrusted with a message from them. (3) "Through letter;" apparently forged letters, purporting to be from (or, literally, <span class= "ital">through</span>) St. Paul, had been circulated. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>.) "Word" and "letter" occur again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2Thessalonians 2:15</a> as his ordinary means of teaching.<p><span class= "bld">As that the day of Christ is at hand</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "to the effect that it is, "--giving the contents of the pretended revelation; for "as that" follows grammatically upon "spirit, word, letter," not upon "shaken, troubled." The word for "is at hand" implies a very close proximity indeed, the participle, in fact (like our word "instant"), being used for "present," <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>. Probably the form which the false doctrine at Thessalonica was beginning to take was that the day of the Lord had already set in, thus confusing the whole idea of a personal, visible Advent, just as, at a later period, Hymenaeus and Philetus confused the true doctrine of resurrection by affirming that it was already past (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-18.htm" title="Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.">2Timothy 2:18</a>). St. Paul not only denies vigorously that the day is come, but proceeds in the next verse to show that the signs of its approach are not yet exhibited. The best reading gives "the day of <span class= "ital">the Lord," </span>not "of Christ." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; to the end that, the purpose for which the apostle besought the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">Ye be not soon</span>; <span class="accented">quickly.</span> This has been variously interpreted, "so soon after my exhortation," or "so soon after my departure from Thessalonica," or "so soon after your reception of the gospel," or "so soon after this opinion of the imminence of Christ's coming was promulgated." Others refer it to manner rather than to time - "soon and with small reason" (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Shaken</span>; agitated like the waves by a storm, as the word signifies. <span class="cmt_word">In mind;</span> or <span class="accented">rather, from your mind</span>;<span class="accented">from your sober reason. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Or be troubled;</span> a still stronger expression; "terrified." <span class="cmt_word">Neither by spirit;</span> not any falsely understood prophecies of the Old Testament, nor any mistaken revelations, whether by visions or dreams; but prophetical discourses delivered by members of the Church in a state of excitement, announcing the immediate coming of Christ, and which were mistaken for Divine communications. There does not appear to have been any intention to deceive; the Thessalonians erred in neglecting "to try the spirits" and to "prove the prophecics." <span class="cmt_word">Nor by word;</span> not any traditional word of Christ, nor any misinterpretation of his prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, nor a calm discourse in distinction from prophetic utterances; but the report of some of the apostle's words, either erroneous or misunderstood. <span class="cmt_word">Nor by letter.</span> Not the apostle's former Epistle to the Thessalonians, the passages in which concerning the advent had been misinterpreted (Paley); for, if this were the case, the apostle would have expressed himself more plainly and would not have repudiated it; but some letter, either forged in the apostle's name or pretending to inculcate his views. <span class="cmt_word">As from us.</span> These words apply to the last two particulars: "Let no pretended saying or pretended letter of mine disturb you in this matter." <span class="cmt_word">As that</span> - to the effect that - <span class="cmt_word">the day of Christ;</span> or, as the best manuscripts read, <span class="accented">of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Is at hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is present</span>, so R.V. The verb is so translated in the other passages where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>), except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>, where it ought also to have been so rendered. It is, however, difficult to conceive how the Thessalonians could think that the day of the Lord was actually present. We cannot imagine that they thought that Christ had already come for judgment. To escape the difficulty, some conceive that "the day of the Lord" is not identical with "the coming of the Lord," but that, besides the actual advent, it includes the events which are its antecedents and concomitants (Eadie). It appears, however, best to suppose that the word is a strong expression for the imminence of that day; that the hour of the advent was about in strike. The Thessalonians ought always to be living in a state of preparation for the day of the Lord, as that day would come suddenly and unexpectedly; but they were not to be so impressed with a sense of its immediateness as to be deprived of their sober reason. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 If errors arise among Christians, we should set them right; and good men will be careful to suppress errors which rise from mistaking their words and actions. We have a cunning adversary, who watches to do mischief, and will promote errors, even by the words of Scripture. Whatever uncertainty we are in, or whatever mistakes may arise about the time of Christ's coming, that coming itself is certain. This has been the faith and hope of all Christians, in all ages of the church; it was the faith and hope of the Old Testament saints. All believers shall be gathered together to Christ, to be with him, and to be happy in his presence for ever. We should firmly believe the second coming of Christ; but there was danger lest the Thessalonians, being mistaken as to the time, should question the truth or certainty of the thing itself. False doctrines are like the winds that toss the water to and fro; and they unsettle the minds of men, which are as unstable as water. It is enough for us to know that our Lord will come, and will gather all his saints unto him. A reason why they should not expect the coming of Christ, as at hand, is given. There would be a general falling away first, such as would occasion the rise of antichrist, that man of sin. There have been great disputes who or what is intended by this man of sin and son of perdition. The man of sin not only practises wickedness, but also promotes and commands sin and wickedness in others; and is the son of perdition, because he is devoted to certain destruction, and is the instrument to destroy many others, both in soul and body. As God was in the temple of old, and worshipped there, and is in and with his church now; so the antichrist here mentioned, is a usurper of God's authority in the Christian church, who claims Divine honours.</body></html>
