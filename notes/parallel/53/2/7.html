The word "mystery" in Greek does not necessarily involve any notion of mysteriousness in our modern sense. It means a secret (which may be, in its own nature, quite simple) known to the initiated, but incapable of being known until it is divulged. Here the whole emphasis is thrown, by a very peculiar order of the Greek words, upon the word "mystery." It may be paraphrased thus:--"For <span class= "ital">as a secret, </span>into which the world is not yet initiated, that lawlessness is <span class= "ital">already</span> at work." Thus the word "mystery" stands in sharp contrast with the word "revealed" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2Thessalonians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a> : the time for publishing, openly avowing, the secret is not yet come. To whom, then, is the mystery of that lawlessness now known? Not to all those who are contributing to its ultimate manifestation, for most of them are deceived by it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2Thessalonians 2:10</a>), and, while sharers in the Apostasy, still believe themselves members of the Church. The mystery is known to God, and (1) to enlightened Christians like St. Paul; (2) to Satan and a few Satanic men who avow to themselves their real object in joining the movement. Though the mystery is said to work (the verb expresses an inward activity, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1Thessalonians 2:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.">Romans 7:5</a>, like that of leaven on the lump), it is not a personal thing, not (like "Man of Sin," "that which withholdeth,") a covert description of any person or set of persons; it is solely the unavowed design which is gradually gaining influence over men's hearts: it is the same movement as the "falling away" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>. In several places (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-18.htm" title="How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.">Jude 1:18</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) the coarser side of the "falling away" is spoken of, but here the "lawlessness" seems not so much to mean ordinary antinomianism as insubordination to God--rebellion.<p><span class= "bld">Only he. . . .</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">Only </span>[<span class= "ital">it cannot be revealed</span>]<span class= "ital"> until he that now withholdeth disappear from the midst.</span> The English version has obscured the meaning by putting "letteth," although the word is precisely the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2Thessalonians 2:6</a>--the only difference being that there it was neuter: "the thing which withholdeth;" while here it is masculine:" he."

The genitive here is that of apposition - "that mystery which is <span class="accented">lawlessness,"</span> whose essence and sphere of operation is lawlessness. <span class="cmt_word">Doth already work;</span> or, <span class="accented">is already working.</span> The mystery of iniquity even now works in secret; but the man of sin himself will not appear until the restraining power be removed. Even at the time the apostle wrote the seeds of apostasy were already sown; the leaven of lawlessness was fermenting inside Christianity; the foundations of a false Christianity were being laid. Thus the apostle warned the Ephesians that false teachers would arise from among themselves; to Timothy he writes of those perilous times which were then present; and, in his Epistles, mention is made of false practices and doctrines, such as the worship of angels, abstinence from meats, bodily mortifications, and the honour conferred on celibacy. So also John, in his First Epistle, refers to this working of this antichristian power when he says, "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists .... Every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>). "Antichrist does not step on the scene suddenly without any preparations; on the contrary, a stream of anti-christian sentiment and conduct pervades the whole history of the world" (Olshausen). <span class="cmt_word">Only he that now letteth;</span> or, <span class="accented">restraineth</span>, the old meaning of the word "let." <span class="accented">Will let.</span> These words are not in the original, and ought to be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Until he be taken out of the way.</span> The whole clause ought to be rendered, "The mystery of lawlessness is already working, only until he who restraineth is removed;" when that takes place, when the restraining influence is removed, the mystery of lawlessness will no longer work secretly, but will be openly manifested. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-12 Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.</body></html>
