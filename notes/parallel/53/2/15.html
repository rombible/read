"Because God chose you from eternity, and called you in time, therefore stand your ground." If it were impossible for them to quit their ground, it would be needless to exhort them <span class= "ital">to</span> maintain it. If it were possible for them to quit their ground, and yet be as well off after all, it would be needless also. At the same time, the "therefore" draws a conclusion, not from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2Thessalonians 2:14</a> alone, but sums up the whole disquisition of the chapter: "Now that you are reminded of the true Advent doctrine."<p><span class= "bld">Hold the traditions.</span>--The very same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-8.htm" title="For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you do.">Mark 7:8</a>, "holding the tradition of the elders;" also in the same metaphorical sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>. The action expressed is a vigorous and pertinacious grasp, as (for instance) of the lame man clutching the Apostles in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-11.htm" title="And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.">Acts 3:11</a>. St. Chrysostom remarks: "It is plain from hence that they used not to deliver all their tradition by letter, but much without writing besides, and that both are equally worthy of belief. Therefore, let us consider the Church's tradition worthy of belief. It is tradition: ask no further questions." What were these "traditions" which it was so essential to keep? The context shows that the particular traditions which were most consciously in St. Paul's mind at the moment, were his eschatological teachings, given to them while he was among them--the lore of which he has been briefly reminding them in this chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2Thessalonians 2:5-6</a>): for the exhortation is practically a resumption of that given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2-3</a>. "Instead of being seduced by the forgers of prophecies or of communications from us, remember the careful instructions we gave you once for all." At the same time, he speaks generally, and we must not limit his words to that particular tradition. <span class= "ital">Whatever</span> can be traced to apostolic-origin is of the essence of the faith. They are to "hold tenaciously" <span class= "ital">all</span> his traditions, and these would include instructions doctrinal (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm" title="Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.">Jude 1:3</a>), ceremonial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1Corinthians 11:23</a>), and moral (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm" title="For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.">2Peter 2:21</a>). As a matter of controversy, it is not so remarkable that he should exhort his converts to cling to his own oral teaching ("whether by word") as that he should at so early a period call their special attention to what was gradually to supplant (at least, in doctrinal matters) all independent unwritten tradition--the Holy Scripture ("our Epistle"). St. Paul can speak on occasion as contemptuously of the "traditions of men" as our Lord did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>). Of course, it depends entirely on the individual character of any tradition whether, and to what extent, it is to be "held" or condemned as "human." In the Church no mutually contradictory traditions can be held together'; and therefore any tradition "by word" which is in disagreement with the written tradition (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Scripture) stands necessarily condemned.<p><span class= "bld">By word, or our epistle.</span>--The "our" belongs <span class= "ital">to</span> both:" whether by word or epistle of ours." Unless, St. Paul had written them some other letter, now lost, this proves that the "First" Epistle was in reality the earlier written. "Have been taught" should be "we<span class= "ital">re</span> taught"--the historic tense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions.</span> Traditions generally denote statements orally delivered and reported; here the word denotes the apostle's instructions in Christianity, whether these are given by word of mouth or by letter. <span class="cmt_word">Which ye have been taught, whether by word;</span> referring to the apostle's preaching when in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">Or our Epistle;</span> referring to the First Epistle to the Thessalonians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 When we hear of the apostacy of many, it is a great comfort and joy, that there is a remnant according to the election of grace, which does and shall persevere; especially we should rejoice, if we have reason to hope that we are of that number. The preservation of the saints, is because God loved them with an everlasting love, from the beginning of the world. The end and the means must not be separated. Faith and holiness must be joined together as well as holiness and happiness. The outward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered effectual by the inward working of the Spirit. The belief of the truth brings the sinner to rely on Christ, and so to love and obey him; it is sealed by the Holy Spirit upon his heart. We have no certain proof of any thing having been delivered by the apostles, more than what we find contained in the Holy Scriptures. Let us then stand fast in the doctrines taught by the apostles, and reject all additions, and vain traditions.</body></html>
