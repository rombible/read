"Again," says St. Chrysostom, "prayer after advice: this is to help in earnest." The word "Himself," as in the passage cited, contrasts the Almighty power of our Lord with the partial instructions and feeble help which even Apostles could give, and with the impotence of the Thessalonian Christians to stand firm in their own strength.<p><span class= "bld">Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father.</span>--The order of mention is unusual. (See, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2Corinthians 13:3</a>.) It is not designedly meant to show the equality of the Blessed Persons, which is done only incidentally by the fact that the same aspiration is directed to both. Probably, in fact, the names are arranged to form a climax: St. Paul having spoken first of the Person whose work on the heart is the more immediate, and then jealously watching lest he should in any way make the Eternal Father seem less deeply interested in our welfare than the Son is. All primitive devotion and doctrine are markedly opposed to the tendency to rest in the Mediator without a real lively faith in the Father who sent Him.<p><span class= "bld">Which hath loved us.</span>--Love to us is <span class= "ital">specially</span> (so fearfully wrong is much of the popular language about the Atonement) the characteristic of the <span class= "ital">Father.</span> (See, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2Corinthians 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm" title="But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a>.) It is in the thought of this tender love of God to us that the writer adds immediately the endearing title "<span class= "ital">Our</span> Father." This love seems to be mentioned here as being the ground on which the writer rests his hope for the fulfilment of his prayer. It should literally be translated, <span class= "ital">which loved us, and gave</span>--the moment being apparently (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>) the moment of providing the Atonement for our sins.<p><span class= "bld">Everlasting consolation.</span>--This means "an ever present source of comfort," of which no persecution can rob us. This giving of comfort is the proof or explanation of the statement that He "loved us," and refers to the same act. Our unfailing comfort lies in the thought of God's love exemplified in the Incarnation of His Son.<p><span class= "bld">Good hope through grace.</span>--These words must be closely joined. God gave us not only a consolation under present trials, but a sweet prospect in the future; but this sweet prospect belongs to us only "<span class= "ital">in</span> grace" (the literal version). All our hope is based on the continuance of the spiritual strength imparted by the Father through the Son and the Spirit. The qualifying words "in grace" are added to "hope" in just the same way as the words "in sanctification" are added to "salvation" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2Thessalonians 2:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now our Lord Jesus Christ, and God, even our Father, who hath loved us.</span> These last words, "who hath loved us," are to be restricted to God our Father, whoso love was manifested in sending his Son to rescue sinners from destruction. <span class="cmt_word">And hath given us everlasting consolation;</span> or, <span class="accented">comfort</span>; everlasting as contrasted with the temporary and deceitful comfort which the world gives. <span class="cmt_word">And good hope through grace;</span> or, <span class="accented">in grace.</span> "In grace" belongs to the verb "hath given," and denotes the mode of the gift - of his own free grace, in contrast to personal merit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:16,17 We may and should direct our prayers, not only to God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, but also to our Lord Jesus Christ himself. And we should pray in his name unto God, not only as his Father, but as our Father in and through him. The love of God in Christ Jesus, is the spring and fountain of all the good we have or hope for. There is good reason for strong consolations, because the saints have good hope through grace. The free grace and mercy of God are what they hope for, and what their hopes are founded on, and not any worth or merit of their own. The more pleasure we take in the word, and works, and ways of God, the more likely we shall be to persevere therein. But, if we are wavering in faith, and of a doubtful mind, halting and faltering in our duty, no wonder that we are strangers to the joys of religion.</body></html>
