Being merely descriptive epithets, we are not at liberty to press the present tense, and say that the Man of Sin was already thus acting at the time St. Paul wrote. The word for "the opposer," or "adversary," is a pretty close rendering of the name "Satan," and passed, in ecclesiastical Greek into a synonym for it. The acts here attributed to the Man of Sin are peculiarly Satanic. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/14-12.htm" title="How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!">Isaiah 14:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2Timothy 3:6</a>.) Of course, however, we must not confound Satan himself with his human minister.<p><span class= "bld">Above all that is called God.</span>--The translation here is not quite exact. The word "above" in the original is compounded with "exalteth"; it should be, <span class= "ital">and super-exalteth, </span>or <span class= "ital">exhalteth himself above</span> <span class= "ital">measure</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>, where the same compound is used) <span class= "ital">against every God so called.</span> Probably the clause "against every God" is to be taken <span class= "ital">only</span> with "super-exalteth "; the description "who opposeth" stands absolutely: it is one characteristic of the Man of Sin to be always in opposition, and to have concord with no one. "Every God so called" includes the false gods <span class= "ital">with</span> the true God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)">1Corinthians 8:5</a>): true or false, it matters not to jealous Antichrist, who would have nothing worshipped but himself. This explains the addition of the little clause, "or that is worshipped." Many things received religious homage from men without being called gods; and the original word (<span class= "ital">sebasma</span>) may perhaps be designed to hint at one such worship, viz., the worship of the Augustus (<span class= "ital">Sebastos</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It would be far-fetched, however, to see in this a direct prophecy of conflict between Antichrist and the Civil Power; although it must be admitted that even the word "gods" is <span class= "ital">sometimes</span> used of secular rulers (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/82-1.htm" title="God stands in the congregation of the mighty; he judges among the gods.">Psalm 82:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?">John 10:34</a>), in which sense some take it here.<p><span class= "bld">So that he as God.</span>--The words "as God" are not part of the original text, and should be struck out. In several other points, however, our version does not bring out the profanity of the act as clearly as the Greek. Literally it would be, "so as to seat <span class= "ital">himself</span> in the shrine of God, showing himself off that he is God." The "himself" brings out the spontaneous arrogancy of the deed; the Man of Sin does not merely yield to servile flatterers. The "sitting" is not in the tense of habitual custom, but indicates one expressive act of taking possession. The "in" (literally, <span class= "ital">into</span>) brings out the idea of actual intrusion; while the word for "temple" is not the general name for the whole group of buildings with their courts, but the sacred house itself: it is the word which would describe the Holy and Holy of Holies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-5.htm" title="And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.">Matthew 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm" title="And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;">Matthew 27:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>) of the Jewish temple; and probably it is the Mercy Seat that supplies the image to St. Paul's mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm" title="The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.">Psalm 99:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The temple of God.</span>--Though the image is drawn from the Jewish temple, we may say with some confidence that St. Paul did not expect the Antichrist as a prose fact to take his seat in that edifice. Neither is the metaphor to be pressed into a mere synonym of "the Church" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1Corinthians 3:17</a>). The words, so far need not <span class= "ital">necessarily</span> mean that the Man of Sin will make special claims upon the Christian community as such. Rather, the whole phrase, "taking his seat in the temple of God," is a poetical or prophetical description of usurping divine prerogatives generally: not the prerogatives of the true God alone, but whatever prerogatives have been offered to anything "called God." Though the prophecy might be fulfilled without any symbolical act (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>of assuming any material throne), yet the spontaneousness ("himself ) and the openness ("showing himself") seem so essentially parts of the prophecy as of necessity to imply that the Man of Sin will make <span class= "ital">formal</span> claim to occupy that central seat in men's minds and aspirations which is acknowledged to be due to God alone. The formal making of this claim seems to be identical with the apocalypse of the Man of Sin, the act by which he is manifested or revealed.<p><span class= "bld">Shewing himself.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">thus showing himself off.</span> It does not mean that he makes any attempt to prove that he is God; the word only carries on the pictorial representation of the Man of Sin enthroning himself upon the Mercy Seat, and by that act of session parading his pretended divinity. As has been said, the performance of a typical act is not of vital consequence to the accomplishment of the prophecy (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a> might have been truly accomplished without the literal riding of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-7.htm" title="And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.">Matthew 21:7</a>), though there are few great movements which do not express themselves in outward typical acts; but these words show that (unless St. Paul was mistaken) an explicit claim will be made for submission, like that of creature to Creator. Even if the "Man of Sin" only signifies a tendency, not a person, yet this "exhibition of himself as God" would hardly be satisfied by a social concession, however widespread, to a general spirit of (say) fleshly luxury or atheistic intellectualism, without the claims of these ideals being <span class= "ital">eo nomine</span> put forward and consciously admitted. But it is hard to believe that anything avowedly atheistic would be spoken of as explicitly claiming or receiving divine honours. It seems, therefore, most probable that the great Apostasy will not become avowedly atheistic, but will be an apostasy (so to speak) within the Church, and that the Man of Sin, who heads that Apostasy, will make especial claim upon the Christian Church to accord consciously the very honours which she pays to the living God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who opposeth;</span> or, <span class="accented">the opposer</span>, taken substantively. The object of opposition is not so much believers, as Christ; he is antichrist, the opponent of Christ. And yet antichrist is not Satan, the great adversary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>), for he is expressly distinguished from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), but the instrument of Satan. As Satan entered into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of perdition, so does he take possession of the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">And exalteth himself above;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">against</span>, in a hostile manner. <span class="cmt_word">All that is called God;</span> not only against all the false gods of the heathen, but also against the true God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or that is worshipped;</span> that is an object of worship. The same word that is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, "As I passed by and beheld your devotions" - the objects of your worship. <span class="cmt_word">So that he as God.</span> The words "as God" are to be omitted, as not found in the best manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">Sitteth in the temple of God.</span> According to some, the temple of Jerusalem (De Wette, Lunemann, Eadie), either as it then existed or as restored according to the prophecy of Ezekiel But it appears more correct to refer the expression metaphorically to the Christian Church. It is a favourite metaphor of Paul to compare believers in particular, or the Church in general, to the temple of God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Showing</span> - exhibiting - <span class="cmt_word">himself that he is God.</span> His sitting in the temple of God was an assertion of his divinity; he claimed to be regarded and worshipped as God. This was the crowning act of his impiety; not only, like the Roman emperors, he demanded to be worshipped as one of many gods, but he claimed to himself the prerogative of the Godhead, not only to the exclusion of the false gods of heathenism, but even of the tree God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 If errors arise among Christians, we should set them right; and good men will be careful to suppress errors which rise from mistaking their words and actions. We have a cunning adversary, who watches to do mischief, and will promote errors, even by the words of Scripture. Whatever uncertainty we are in, or whatever mistakes may arise about the time of Christ's coming, that coming itself is certain. This has been the faith and hope of all Christians, in all ages of the church; it was the faith and hope of the Old Testament saints. All believers shall be gathered together to Christ, to be with him, and to be happy in his presence for ever. We should firmly believe the second coming of Christ; but there was danger lest the Thessalonians, being mistaken as to the time, should question the truth or certainty of the thing itself. False doctrines are like the winds that toss the water to and fro; and they unsettle the minds of men, which are as unstable as water. It is enough for us to know that our Lord will come, and will gather all his saints unto him. A reason why they should not expect the coming of Christ, as at hand, is given. There would be a general falling away first, such as would occasion the rise of antichrist, that man of sin. There have been great disputes who or what is intended by this man of sin and son of perdition. The man of sin not only practises wickedness, but also promotes and commands sin and wickedness in others; and is the son of perdition, because he is devoted to certain destruction, and is the instrument to destroy many others, both in soul and body. As God was in the temple of old, and worshipped there, and is in and with his church now; so the antichrist here mentioned, is a usurper of God's authority in the Christian church, who claims Divine honours.</body></html>
