The pronoun is somewhat emphatic. It might have seemed more natural to have sharpened the contrast between the Thessalonian Christians and the unhappy people just mentioned by beginning "But you." It is, however, part of St. Paul's delicacy of sympathy to describe rather the effect upon himself and his two companions of <span class= "ital">observing</span> that contrast. He sets himself to work the contrast out.<p><span class= "bld">Beloved of the Lord.</span>--Precisely the same phrase as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1Thessalonians 1:4</a>, except for the substitution of "the Lord" for "God," which shows the concurrence of the Eternal Son in His Father's predestinations. As in the former passage, the tense ("who have been loved") makes the reader think of the everlasting duration of that love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm" title="The LORD has appeared of old to me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you.">Jeremiah 31:3</a>), and is again connected with the mystery of election.<p>"O love, who ere life's earliest dawn<p>On me thy choice hast gently laid."<p><span class= "bld">Hath . . . chosen.</span>--The Greek tense should be rendered by <span class= "ital">chose, </span>referring to the definite moment (so to speak) in the divine counsels when the choice was fixed. This moment is defined as "from the beginning," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the eternity preceding the origin of time, called by the same name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>. It does not simply mean "from the outset," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the moment of first thinking at all about you. The identical phrase is said not to occur again in St. Paul. It may be noticed that there is a striking various-reading in some of the MSS., involving the change of only one letter, which would give us (instead of "chose you from the beginning") "chose you as firstfruits." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; but the reading in the text is better supported.<p><span class= "bld">To salvation.</span>--This "salvation" is in contrast with the "destruction" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2Thessalonians 1:9</a>), "perdition" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>), or "perishing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2Thessalonians 2:10</a>), all of which represent the same word in the Greek. Out of the wreck of a world, God had from eternity chosen these Thessalonians to come off safely.<p><span class= "bld">Through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</span>--This again teaches us the apostolic idea of election. It is not an absolute irreversible predestination to a particular state of happiness on which the elect is to enter after death. The "salvation" is present, begun in this life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>), and carried on along fixed lines, namely, "in sanctification of spirit and belief of truth" (such is the literal rendering). The preposition "in" has here the same force as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1Thessalonians 4:7</a>, namely, <span class= "ital">"</span>by way of," "by a course of." If, therefore, God chose the Thessalonian Christians to salvation by a course of sanctification and belief, one thing, at any rate, is clear: that if any of them should leave that course, and fall into the errors and sins denounced in the foregoing verses, then, in the Apostle's mind, they would have forfeited their salvation, in spite of God's choice of them. Consequently, we are forced to one of two theories: either that the man has no free will at all, the moral character of his actions depending as entirely upon God as his final destiny; or else, that the man is free, and that God singles him out to enjoy special opportunities of sanctification and of correct belief, which the man may accept or reject as he pleases. The first of these theories lies open to the question, why, if God is responsible for the moral character of the actions of His elect and for their belief, He does not sanctify them at once and completely, and make each one infallible in doctrine; but, in any case, lax morality or creed is as incompatible with the hope of a Calvinist as with that of an orthodox Christian. "Sanctification of spirit" seems to mean "spiritual sanctification:" an inward process, not merely outward change of conduct. This is, of course, wrought by the action of the Holy Spirit upon our spirits; but the omission of the definite article in the Greek is difficult to explain if the "spirit" mentioned be other than the spirit acted upon. "Belief of truth" is opposed to "believing the lie," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2Thessalonians 2:11</a> : acceptation of facts as they are, especially the deep facts of revelation, is always the great means of sanctification in Holy Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; this may be considered as a simple particle of transition, or as containing a contrast to these alluded to in the previous verses. I thank God that you are not exposed to the delusions of the man of sin and to the destruction of his followers. <span class="cmt_word">We</span>. By some restricted to Paul, and by others as including Silas and Timotheus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are bound to give thanks alway to God.</span> Notwithstanding the disorders which had arisen in the Church of Thessalonica, Paul had abundant reason to thank God for his great grace vouchsafed to the Thessalonians, in retaining them in the gospel, and in enabling them to abound in faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">For you, brethren beloved of the Lord;</span> that is, of Christ. In the former Epistle he calls them "beloved of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>), here "of Christ;" one of the numerous indirect proofs in these Epistles of the 1)trinity of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Because God hath from the beginning.</span> Some valuable manuscripts read, "because God hath chosen you as firstfruits," and this rendering has been adopted by several eminent expositors (Jowett, Hofmann, Riggenbach); but the preponderance of authorities is in favour of the reading in our A.V. The phrase, "from the beginning, does not denote "from the beginning' of the gospel," but "from eternity." The apostle refers the salvation of the Thessalonians to the eternal election of God. <span class="cmt_word">Chosen you to salvation</span> - the final purpose of God's election. <span class="cmt_word">Through</span>; or rather, in, denoting the elements in which the salvation consisted, or, which is the same thing, the state into which they were chosen. <span class="cmt_word">Sanctification of the Spirit</span> - the Divine side - <span class="cmt_word">and belief of the truth</span> - the human side of the element in which the salvation was realized. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 When we hear of the apostacy of many, it is a great comfort and joy, that there is a remnant according to the election of grace, which does and shall persevere; especially we should rejoice, if we have reason to hope that we are of that number. The preservation of the saints, is because God loved them with an everlasting love, from the beginning of the world. The end and the means must not be separated. Faith and holiness must be joined together as well as holiness and happiness. The outward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered effectual by the inward working of the Spirit. The belief of the truth brings the sinner to rely on Christ, and so to love and obey him; it is sealed by the Holy Spirit upon his heart. We have no certain proof of any thing having been delivered by the apostles, more than what we find contained in the Holy Scriptures. Let us then stand fast in the doctrines taught by the apostles, and reject all additions, and vain traditions.</body></html>
