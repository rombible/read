The election or choice takes place in eternity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2Thessalonians 2:13</a>); the call at that point of time when the men first hear the gospel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By our gospel</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, of course, "by our bringing you the happy message"--the historical delivery of the message is dwelt on rather than its contents.<p><span class= "bld">To the obtaining of the glory of our Lord.</span>--Almost all the ancient commentators render it, "for obtaining of glory to our Lord;" and St. Chrysostom says, beautifully:" No small thing this either, if Christ esteems our salvation His glory. It is, indeed, a glory to the lover of men that the number of those who are being saved should be large." But this version is not so easy grammatically as our own, nor does it suit so well with the context. St. Paul is encouraging his readers with the same thought of their destiny which he has put forward in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm" title="Why also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:">2Thessalonians 1:11-12</a>--the identity of the joy of the Redeemer and the redeemed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:23</a>). It is well to be observed that God did not call them straight "to the glory of our Lord," but "to the obtaining" of the same. This "obtaining" does not mean an otiose receiving of glory in the last day, but a laborious course of "earning" or "purchasing" it during this life. The word is the same as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Thessalonians 5:9</a>, where see Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto</span>; <span class="accented">to which.</span> The reference being to the whole clause, being "chosen to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth." <span class="cmt_word">He called you.</span> Whom God elects from eternity, he calls in time. <span class="cmt_word">By our gospel;</span> the gospel preached by us. <span class="cmt_word">To the obtaining</span> (or, <span class="accented">acquisition</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Different meaning's have been attached to these words; some render them "for the purpose of an acquisition of glory to Jesus Christ;" others, "for a glorious possession of Jesus Christ;" and others, "to be possessors or sharers in the glory of Jesus Christ." The last meaning is the correct one. Believers are constituted "heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 When we hear of the apostacy of many, it is a great comfort and joy, that there is a remnant according to the election of grace, which does and shall persevere; especially we should rejoice, if we have reason to hope that we are of that number. The preservation of the saints, is because God loved them with an everlasting love, from the beginning of the world. The end and the means must not be separated. Faith and holiness must be joined together as well as holiness and happiness. The outward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered effectual by the inward working of the Spirit. The belief of the truth brings the sinner to rely on Christ, and so to love and obey him; it is sealed by the Holy Spirit upon his heart. We have no certain proof of any thing having been delivered by the apostles, more than what we find contained in the Holy Scriptures. Let us then stand fast in the doctrines taught by the apostles, and reject all additions, and vain traditions.</body></html>
