The purpose of the verses following is not merely to describe Antichrist more fully, but to compare word for word his coming with that which will annihilate him. Again is used of Antichrist a peculiar word consecrated to the Christ: "coming" (literally <span class= "ital">presence</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>being the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a>, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,">2Thessalonians 2:1</a>, and often.

The predicate is not "after the working," but "in all power," &c. The advent of Antichrist will be in (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>surrounded with, accompanied by) all kinds of miracles, "according to the working of Satan:" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>not only wrought by Satan, but up to the full capacity of Satan to work them. The word "lying" (literally, <span class= "ital">of falsehood</span>) should go with all three names, "all counterfeit power and signs and wonders." The three words are piled up to heighten the terror of the description; if you press them they mean that there will be a display of power, to attest Antichrist's doctrine (signs), and to keep men spellbound in admiration of him (wonders). Antichrist, like Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm" title="Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;">1Timothy 6:15</a>), has one to support him--Satan instead of God; he, like Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25</a>), will have his miracles--but miracles of trickery, not of truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The apostle resumes his description of the man of sin. <span class="accented">Even him</span>; not in the original, but necessary for the sense. <span class="cmt_word">Whose coming.</span> The use of the same term, <span class="accented">parousia</span>, employed to denote the coming of Christ exhibits the counterpart of the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">Is after the working</span> - according to the energy - <span class="cmt_word">of Satan.</span> Satan is the agent who works in the man of sin; he being the organ or instrument of Satan. <span class="cmt_word">With all power and signs and lying wonders.</span> The adjective "lying" ought to be rendered as a substantive, and applied to all three: "With all powers and signs and wonders of falsehood;" whose origin, nature, and purpose is falsehood. Here, also, the counterpart to Christ is manifest; for the same terms - "powers," "signs," and "wonders," are employed to denote his miracles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). The miracles of Christ were miracles of truth; the miracles of the man of sin would be miracles of falsehood. There does not seem to be any essential difference between powers, signs, and wonders; but the words are employed as a mere rhetorical enumeration. It is not to be supposed that the man of sin will be enabled to perform real miracles; they are the wonders of falsehood; but still by them his followers will be deceived (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-12 Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.</body></html>
