The purpose with which St. Paul began this chapter was to show relatively the date of our Lord's Advent; but he is now so engrossed in describing the events which must precede it, that when he does mention the Advent again he does so in a parenthetical relative clause.<p><span class= "bld">That Wicked.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">the</span> <span class= "ital">Lawless One.</span> The English version has again obscured the passage by not keeping the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2Thessalonians 2:7</a>. The general tendency to "lawlessness" or "rebellion" will be brought to a head in the person of "the Lawless One" or "the "Rebel," just as the "obstruction" is impersonated in "the Obstructor." The publication of the "secret of rebelliousness" will be effected by the manifesto of the Rebel-in-chief. Of course, this Rebel is the same person with the Man of Sin, the change of title being due to the particularising of his sin by the word "lawlessness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2Thessalonians 2:7</a>; the specification of the <span class= "ital">time</span> is the only additional intelligence; all the emphasis of the sentence, therefore, rests on "And <span class= "ital">then."</span><p><span class= "bld">The Lord.</span>--The best text adds the name Jesus, which serves more clearly to contrast Him with His rival. The word "whom" might be more pointedly paraphrased by "and him."<p><span class= "bld">With the spirit of his mouth.</span>--St. Paul is quoting roughly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-9.htm" title="By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.">Job 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm" title="Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/11-20.htm" title="Yea, and without these might they have fallen down with one blast, being persecuted of vengeance, and scattered abroad through the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight.">Wisdom Of Solomon 11:20</a> : "might have fallen down with one blast, . . . scattered abroad through the breath of Thy power"); and therefore we are to understand it to signify the perfect ease with which Christ will destroy Antichrist. Even when the phrase is used of speech (as it may perhaps be here), the absence of labour is the point to be noticed (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">With the brightness of his coming.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">with the appearing of His presence.</span> Here, again, it is the mere fact of the true Christ's showing Himself, which will reduce to nothingness (such is the meaning of the Greek for "destroy") the false Christ. When they shall stand face to face there will be no possibility of delusion any more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And then;</span> namely, so soon as he that restraineth is taken out of the way. <span class="cmt_word">Shall that Wicked;</span> or, <span class="accented">that lawless one</span>, in whom the mystery of lawlessness is realized; not different from, but the same with, the "man of sin, the son of perdition." <span class="cmt_word">Be revealed;</span> appear unveiled in all his naked deformity. No longer working secretly, but openly, and in an undisguised form; no longer the mystery, but the revelation of lawlessness. The apostle now interrupts his description of the man of sin by announcing his doom. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the Lord;</span> or, as the best attested manuscripts read, <span class="accented">whom the Lord Jesus.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Shall consume;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">shall slay</span> (R.V.). <span class="cmt_word">With the spirit</span> (or, <span class="accented">breath</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of his mouth.</span> Various interpretations have been given to this clause. Some refer it to the Word of God, and others to the Holy Spirit, and suppose that the conversion of the world is here predicted; but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation, as the doom of antichrist is here announced. Others refer the term to a cry or word, and think that the sentence of condemnation pronounced by the Lord Jesus on the wicked is intended. But the words are to be taken literally as a description of the power and irresistible might of Christ at his coming - that the mere breath of his mouth is sufficient to consume the wicked (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked"). <span class="cmt_word">And shall destroy</span> (or, <span class="accented">annihilate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with the brightness</span> (or, <span class="accented">appearance</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of his coming.</span> The two words, <span class="accented">epiphany</span> and <span class="accented">parousia</span>, which are elsewhere used separately to denote the coming of Christ, are here employed. There is no ground for the assertion that the first is the subjective and the second the objective aspect of Christ's coming (Olshausen). The brightness of Christ's coming is not here expressed; but the meaning is that the mere appearance of Christ's presence will annihilate the wicked. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-12 Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.</body></html>
