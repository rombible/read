These words take up the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.">2Thessalonians 3:4</a>, "Ye will do the things which (at any time) we command you; now the thing which we command you is this."<p><span class= "bld">In the name of our Lord.</span>--To do anything in a person's name seems to mean, in the first instance, the actual pronouncing of the name in the performance of the action--to do it name on lip, just as to "come in a rod" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1Corinthians 4:21</a>) literally means <span class= "ital">rod in hand.</span> Thus, miracles are commonly said to be performed "in the name of the Lord," viz., with the audible repetition of His name (for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm" title="And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;">Mark 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17</a>); and for examples of the way in which the name was literally so used, we may refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm" title="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.">Acts 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-34.htm" title="And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.">Acts 9:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Philippians 2:10</a>, where, as the adoration paid to Jesus Himself is the point, the phrase must mean, "mentioning the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow." From this mention of the name in performing an action, our phrase assumes, at any rate, two distinct meanings: (1) As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>, it implies an invocation or attestation of the person named, or a recognition of his presence and interest in the matter, in which sense it has passed into the common language of Christianity, into legal formulas, &c. (2) Here, and usually, it means a claim to the <span class= "ital">authority</span> of the person named--to act officially as his representative with full powers. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm" title="And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.">John 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>.) Thus the prophets spoke "in the name of the Lord"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as His authoritative exponents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-10.htm" title="Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.">James 5:10</a>); St. Paul commands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-18.htm" title="And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.">Acts 16:18</a>), and retains a man's sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>) "in the name of the Lord"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as His official spokesman or ambassador; the priests are to administer the unction of the sick with like authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-14.htm" title="Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:">James 5:14-15</a>). So here, the Thessalonians are not to think that in disobeying St. Paul's injunctions they are rebelling against a mere human authority; Christ Himself speaks to them through St. Paul's lips. Yet, commanding with all this tremendous authority, they are still but "brethren" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-8.htm" title="But be not you called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all you are brothers.">Matthew 23:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Withdraw yourselves.</span>--The striking word here used is (in its simple form) only found besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20</a> : "avoiding this." In a still more striking compound, it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-20.htm" title="And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,">Acts 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>. It is a metaphor from the language of strategy a cautious general shrinking from an encounter and timidly drawing off under cover. Perhaps, we might illustrate it by the familiar English <span class= "ital">"fight shy of</span> every brother." A social excommunication rather than ecclesiastical seems chiefly meant, though the latter might perhaps be involved.<p><span class= "bld">From every brother</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>every Christian. It was impossible to be so strict about the outside world. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.">1Corinthians 5:10-11</a>.) The man still remains a "brother" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm" title="Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.">2Thessalonians 3:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Disorderly.</span>--The word is rendered "unruly" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm" title="Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.">1Thessalonians 5:14</a>, and is possibly suggested by the military metaphor above. It means properly "out of rank." The kind of irregularity which is meant is made clear by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10-11</a>. The worthy Bengel quaintly makes this an opportunity for denouncing the Mendicant Orders: "An order of mendicants, then, is not an order; if the Thessalonians had bound themselves to it by a vow, what would St. Paul have said?"<p><span class= "bld">The tradition.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2Thessalonians 2:15</a>. The word must imply systematic and definite teaching; and we see here again that a clear code of ethics was part of the apostolic catechism. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>)<p><span class= "bld">He received.</span>--The best rendering is, <span class= "ital">which they received</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>all the brethren who walked disorderly. The word "receive" is the regular correlative to "tradition" or "deliver." (See, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-4.htm" title="And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables.">Mark 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1Corinthians 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm" title="As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel to you than that you have received, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now we command you, brethren.</span> An injunction, not specially directed to the elders or office bearers, but to the members, of the Church in general (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Strengthening the command, as being given in the Name and authority of the great Head of the Church; not we, but Christ himself commands you. <span class="cmt_word">That ye withdraw yourselves.</span> A nautical expression, denoting to "shorten the sails;" hence metaphorically to keep out of the way, to withdraw; that ye avoid intercourse and fellowship with; no allusion as yet to excommunication. <span class="cmt_word">From every brother</span> - follow Christian - <span class="cmt_word">that walketh disorderly;</span> literally, <span class="accented">out of the ranks</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And not after the tradition;</span> or, <span class="accented">the instructions</span>; not the example of the apostle, which is afterwards mentioned, but the instructions which he orally delivered when at Thessalonica, and subsequently confirmed by the Epistle which he had written to them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which he received of us.</span> Here the readings of manuscripts differ.

Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.</body></html>
