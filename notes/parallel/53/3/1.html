St. Paul leaves people praying for him everywhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;">Romans 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm" title="Brothers, pray for us.">1Thessalonians 5:25</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-18.htm" title="Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.">Hebrews 13:18</a>). In all these cases the request is for active help in his work of evangelising:" not that he may fall into no danger," says St. Chrysostom, "for that he was appointed unto." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-9.htm" title="Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.">2Timothy 2:9</a>.) "That" stands for "in order that," and does not introduce merely the subject of the prayer.<p><span class= "bld">May have free course.</span>--Quite literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">may run along.</span> Speed and security are contained in this idea: no hesitation about the next turn, no anxious picking of the way, and no opposition from devils and bad men. Bengel compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-15.htm" title="He sends forth his commandment on earth: his word runs very swiftly.">Psalm 147:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And be glorified.</span>--The word does not mean merely "obtain applause," "win distinction," as a successful runner; it always implies the recognition or acknowledgment of inherent admirable qualities. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm" title="That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2Thessalonians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1Thessalonians 2:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Even as it is with you.</span>--Such praise would flush the Thessalonians to pray for him with greater fervour and assurance. "With you" means, in the Greek, "in your direction," "on turning to you:" people had only to look at Thessalonica, and they were forced to recognise the character of the gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally</span>; <span class="accented">furthermore</span>; <span class="accented">for the rest</span>; introducing the concluding part of the Epistle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, pray for us</span> (see a similar request in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:25</a>). Observe the unselfishness of the apostle's request. He does not ask the Thessalonians to pray specially for himself, but for the unimpeded diffusion and success of the gospel, and for himself only in so far as that he might be freed from all hindrances in preaching the gospel - that God would be pleased to crown his labours with success. That; introducing the subject matter of prayer; what he requested the Thessalonians to pray for. <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord</span> - namely, the gospel - <span class="cmt_word">may have</span> <span class="cmt_word">free course;</span> literally, <span class="accented">may run</span>; that all obstacles to its progress may be removed; that its diffusion may be free and unimpeded; that, like the sun, it may rejoice as a strong man to run his race (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-15.htm">Psalm 147:15</a>, "He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly"). <span class="cmt_word">And be glorified;</span> namely, in the conversion of souls (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>). The allusion may be to the applause given to the victors in the foot races which constituted so considerable a part of the Grecian games. This personification of the Word of the Lord is a favourite figure with the apostle. "In St. Paul's language there is but a thin film between the Holy Ghost, the Divine personal Spirit, and the spirit in the believer's inmost being. And so in St. Paul's conception there is but a thin film between the Word preached and the living Word of God who is God" (Bishop Alexander). <span class="cmt_word">Even as it is with you;</span> a recognition of the eagerness with which the Thessalonians had received the gospel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Those who are far apart still may meet together at the throne of grace; and those not able to do or receive any other kindness, may in this way do and receive real and very great kindness. Enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, are unreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and no wonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours to oppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are other evils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to depend upon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performance is sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that was founded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is our sin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects. There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, by the special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not, we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, to obey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to the love of God, and the patience of Christ.</body></html>
