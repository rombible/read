St. Paul, after his favourite manner, is playing upon two meanings of the word: "But whether men have faith or not, the Lord is faithful." There is the same play of words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a>. "The Lord" seems here to be used, as was said on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1Thessalonians 3:12</a>, without distinct reference to one Person of the Holy Trinity rather than another. This characteristic of God is named because God stands pledged to all who believe in Him.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall stablish you.</span>--How soon St. Paul reverts from his own needs to theirs! He does not continue, as we should expect, with "who will preserve <span class= "ital">us"</span><p><span class= "bld">Keep you from evil.</span>--Rather (probably), <span class= "ital">from the Evil One, </span>as in the Lord's Prayer. Possibly, the word is used not without a reference to the word rendered "wicked" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.">2Thessalonians 3:2</a>, with which in the Greek it is identical.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; in contrast with the men just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is faithful;</span> as if the apostle had said," Man may be faithless, but the Lord is faithful" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>). "In contrast to the infidelity of man, he praises the fidelity of God" (Bengel). By the Lord, Christ is meant. In the former Epistle, faithfulness is attributed to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>), here to Christ. This faithfulness of Christ consisted in watching over his Church, and in effecting its diffusion in spite of all the opposition of these unreasonable and wicked men. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil;</span> or, <span class="accented">the evil.</span> The word "evil" may be either masculine or neuter: if masculine, then it denotes "the evil one;" if neuter, then "evil" in general. There is nothing in the word itself to determine its meaning; this must be learned from the context. Most commentators (Calvin, Bengel, Olshausen, Hofmann, Macknight, Ellicott, Eadie, and Bishop Alexander) suppose that the evil one is meant; and it is so rendered in the R.V.: "Guard you from the evil one." But it is better to take the word abstractly "evil" in general, whether evil persons or evil things; as a contrast to "every good word and work" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>). So Alford, Lunemann, De Wette, Jowett, Lillie. There is the same difference of opinion with regard to the words in the Lord's Prayer: "Deliver us from evil;" or "from the evil one" (R.V.). Here, also, notwithstanding the high authorities on the opposite side, we consider that our Lord's words are not limited to the evil one, but are to be taken generally - "evil" in the widest sense, as being much more forcible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Those who are far apart still may meet together at the throne of grace; and those not able to do or receive any other kindness, may in this way do and receive real and very great kindness. Enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, are unreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and no wonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours to oppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are other evils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to depend upon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performance is sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that was founded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is our sin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects. There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, by the special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not, we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, to obey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to the love of God, and the patience of Christ.</body></html>
