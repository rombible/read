The Person of the Blessed Trinity to whom this guidance immediately belongs is the Holy Ghost. So far, the Greek expositors are right who are agreed to consider this a proof of the Holy Ghost's divinity. Their right conclusion is, however, drawn from wrong premise, for the name is not here to be taken as consciously intending Him. The ground for their supposition is that the names "God" and "Christ" occur immediately after, and not (as we might expect) "His" or "for Him." But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1Thessalonians 3:12-13</a>, there occurs precisely the same arrangement of the three words: the Greek equivalent for the sacred Hebrew Name standing first, and then, for clearness' sake, being explained by the personal titles, "God our Father," "our Lord Jesus Christ."<p><span class= "bld">Direct your hearts into the love of God.</span>--This prayer in itself implies that they had not yet reached the point which St. Paul would have them reach, and were perhaps not taking the directest course. The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-79.htm" title="To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.">Luke 1:79</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.">1Thessalonians 3:11</a>. The "love of God<span class= "ital">"</span> here meant is that practical love which consists in keeping the commandments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>), as may be seen from the context:--"I am sure that the Lord will strengthen you, and that you are doing and will continue to do as you are bidden: may God help you to the obedience of true love, and to such perseverance in obedience as was shown by Christ; and it is in this hope that we bid you take steps to repress the disorders which are prevalent among you."<p><span class= "bld">The patient waiting for Christ.</span>--This rendering is so beautiful in itself, and so well in keeping with the leading thoughts of these two Epistles, that it is painful to be forced to reject it. But the only rendering which is possible is, <span class= "ital">Christ's patience;</span> and the simplest meaning of that phrase is "the endurance which characterises Christ," the genitive being, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1Thessalonians 1:3</a>, almost a descriptive adjective, "Christ-like," "Christian endurance." This "patience" includes both the thought of bearing up under their present persecutions and also the thought of "patient continuance in well doing," as opposed to the fitful restlessness which had begun to prey upon the Thessalonian Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord;</span> namely, Christ, for so the word "Lord" is to be rendered in St. Paul's Epistles. Bishop Wordsworth supposes that the Holy Ghost is here invoiced, as both God and Christ are afterwards mentioned in the petition; but the term "Lord" is not applied by, the apostle to the Holy Ghost; '<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a> is the only apparent exception. <span class="cmt_word">Direct your hearts;</span> as the heart is the fountain of Christian life - the centre of the will. <span class="cmt_word">Into the love of God.</span> Here not God's love to us, specially "the manifestation of the love of God in Christ and his work of redemption" (Olshausen); nor the love of God to man, which is to be the pattern of our love to God; but, objectively, our love to God. This love of God is the fulfilment of the Law; and hence the apostle prays that the Thessalonians may be directed into it as the source and essence of all acceptable obedience. <span class="cmt_word">And into the patient waiting for Christ.</span> The words, "patient waiting," are but one word in the original, generally translated "patience" or "endurance." The clause has been differently interpreted. Some (Calvin, Hofmann, Jowett) render it, as in the A.V., "patient waiting for Christ." And this is conformable to the context, as the object of Paul was to repress all impatient longing for the advent. But such a meaning is not linguistically justifiable. Others render it, "patience for Christ," that is, steadfast endurance for his sake (De Wette); but there is no preposition in the original. The words simply mean "Christ's patience," or "the patience of Christ" (R.V.), the patience which he exhibited under his unparalleled sufferings. The Thessalonians were exposed to persecutions, and therefore the apostle prays that they might be directed into the patience of Christ, as this would enable them to bear all their sufferings with composure. Love and patience comprehend the active and passive virtues of Christianity. Now follows a warning against the disorderly life and conduct which the expectation of the immediate advent of Christ had produced. On account of the supposed nearness of the day of the Lord, great disorders had arisen in the Thessalonian Church. Work had been given up by many, who walked about in fanatical idleness. The apostle had censured this conduct in his former Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11, 12</a>), but the evil had rather increased than diminished; and, accordingly, he severely rebukes this spirit, and sets himself to correct the disorders occasioned by it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Those who are far apart still may meet together at the throne of grace; and those not able to do or receive any other kindness, may in this way do and receive real and very great kindness. Enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, are unreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and no wonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours to oppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are other evils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to depend upon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performance is sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that was founded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is our sin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects. There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, by the special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not, we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, to obey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to the love of God, and the patience of Christ.</body></html>
