The Greek secular salutation, at greeting and parting alike, was <span class= "ital">chaire</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">rejoice</span>); so St. Paul, alike at beginning and ending, uses a word of kindred origin, <span class= "ital">charis</span> ("grace"). Observe the word "all" again, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm" title="Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.">2Thessalonians 3:16</a>. St. Chrysostom's beautiful comment may well be given: "What he calls his 'salutation' is the prayer, snowing that the whole business they were then about was spiritual; and even when he must give a salutation, there must go some benefit along with it, and it must be a prayer, not a mere symbol of friendship. 'Twas with this he would begin, and with this he would end, fencing round that which he said with mighty walls on either side; and safe were the foundations he laid, and safe the conclusion that he laid thereon. 'Grace to you,' he cries, 'and peace'; and once more, ['Peace always' and] 'the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.--Amen.

And let us desire the same blessings for ourselves and our friends. Peace with God. This peace is desired for them always, or in every thing. Peace by all means; in every way; that, as they enjoyed the means of grace, they might use all methods to secure peace. We need nothing more to make us safe and happy, nor can we desire any thing better for ourselves and our friends, than to have God's gracious presence with us and them. No matter where we are, if God be with us; nor who is absent, if God be present. It is through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that we hope to have peace with God, and to enjoy the presence of God. This grace is all in all to make us happy; though we wish ever so much to others, there remains enough for ourselves.</body></html>
