It does not give the reason why St. Paul and his companions worked: "because we strictly enjoined you to work, and therefore could not be idle ourselves." Rather, it justifies the reiteration of the command: "We do not hesitate to command you now to repress this disorderly conduct, so contrary to the example set you; for, in fact, when we were with you we used to lay down this law." So Theodoret takes it: "It is no new thing that we write to you."<p><span class= "bld">We commanded.</span>--The tense in the original is that of constant re-assertion, which brings out once more the thorough grounding which the Apostles gave at once to their converts. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a> : "the tradition;" also the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2Thessalonians 2:5</a>.) The same definite precept is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">If any would not work.</span>--The word "would" stands for "is not willing," "refuses." To any weakness or incapacity for work, except in himself, St. Paul would be very tender; the vice consists in the defective <span class= "ital">will.</span> The canon (in the original) is laid down in the pointed form of some old Roman law like those of the Twelve Tables: "If any man choose not to work, neither let him eat." It does not mean, "let him leave off eating," putting it to the man's own conscience to see the necessary connection between the two things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a>); but, "let him not be fed." The Thessalonians are not to be misled into a false charity: giving food in Christ's name to persons who are capable of working and able to get work, and are too indolent to do so. The support which is here forbidden to be given to these disorderly persons might come either direct from the private liberality of individuals, or from some collected church fund administered by the deacons. It does not seem at all impossible that this Thessalonian Church, which St. Paul himself declares to have taken the churches of Judaea for a model (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1Thessalonians 2:14</a>), may have copied its model in adopting some form of communism, or, at any rate, some extensive use of the <span class= "ital">agape</span> which we see to have been in use at Corinth, established by the Apostle at the very time of writing this Letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1Corinthians 11:21</a>). Such a supposition would give much more point to St. Paul's canon, as well as to other phrases in both these Epistles, and would enable us to understand better how this discipline could be actively enforced. That the ordinary <span class= "ital">agape</span> was a matter of considerable importance to the poorer classes is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.">1Corinthians 11:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For even when we were with you;</span> during our residence in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">This we commanded, that if any man would not work, neither should he eat.</span> This or similar expressions have been shown to be a proverb in frequent use among the Jews. Thus: "Whoever doth not work doth not eat" ('Bereshith Rabba'); "Let not him who would not labour before the sabbath eat on the sabbath" ('In Lib. Zenon.'). It is a law of nature, and the apostle here sanctions it as a law of Christianity. There is here a reference to the sentence pronounced on man in Paradise in consequence of disobedience: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). Labour, indeed, may in one point of view be considered as part of the curse, but it is also a blessing adapted to man's fallen nature. Labour is the law of God; idleness is the parent of many crimes and is productive of misery. He who has no business allotted to him ought to choose some useful occupation for himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-15 Those who have received the gospel, are to live according to the gospel. Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.</body></html>
