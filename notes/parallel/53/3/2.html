This clause is an amplification of the word "may run along:" the impediments to the gospel progress were (except that all were overruled for good) such persecutions as these. St. Paul gives thanks for such deliverances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;">2Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Persecutions, afflictions, which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.">2Timothy 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.">2Timothy 4:17</a>. Perhaps (as St. Chrysostom suggests) one reason for here inviting their prayers for himself was to nerve the Thessalonians by the sense that they were not the only people in the world in danger.<p><span class= "bld">From unreasonable and wicked men.</span>--The curious word rendered "unreasonable" is rendered "amiss" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-41.htm" title="And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.">Luke 23:41</a>, "wickedness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-5.htm" title="Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.">Acts 25:5</a>, "harm" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-6.htm" title="However, they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.">Acts 28:6</a>, occurring nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means something "misplaced" hence "extravagant," "monstrous." Thus the dying robber says that our Lord had done "nothing so monstrous" as to deserve crucifixion; Festus ironically invites the priests to a serious journey to St. Paul's trial, "if there be something so monstrous in him;" the Maltese barbarians "saw that nothing so monstrous happened to him after all." So St. Paul wishes the Thessalonians to pray for his deliverance "from these monstrous and depraved people." He is evidently meaning some particular foes whom he fears, for the original has the definite article. Who, then, are "these monstrous persons?" If we turn to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-6.htm" title="And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go to the Gentiles.">Acts 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>, and observe the circumstances in which the letter was written, we can hardly doubt that they are the unbelieving Jews of Corinth. From these Jews he was, though narrowly, delivered. It was, perhaps, in direct answer to the prayers for which St. Paul here asks that he received the vision and assurances of our Lord, and that Gallio was moved to quash so abruptly the proceedings of the Jews.<p><span class= "bld">For all men have not faith.</span>--This clause gives the reason for the alarm implied in the last clause: "Do not be surprised at my needing help against bad men; for you know that it is not every one that believes." There is something a little scornful and embittered in the expression (recalling the invective against the same people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1Thessalonians 2:15-16</a>), for it suggests the thought that nothing better was to be expected from such a set of unconverted Jews. Tacitly, also, the unbelieving Corinthians are contrasted with the Thessalonians who had so readily embraced the truth. It may, however, be doubted whether this sentence is not an instance of a common Hebrew idiom, occurring more than twenty times in the Greek Testament, by which the combination of "all" and "not" amounts to "not any." Thus, "all flesh shall not be justified," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>, is rendered "no flesh shall be justified;" "they are not all of us," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1John 2:19</a>, means "not one of them is of us." So here it may be, "for there is not one of them that believes;" and so also, again speaking of the Jews, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias said, Lord, who has believed our report?">Romans 10:16</a>, "they did not all obey" may mean "none of them obeyed"--a rhetorical exaggeration, which the writer proceeds to justify by the exhaustive question from Isaiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that;</span> a further addition to the prayer. <span class="cmt_word">We</span>; either I Paul, or else Paul and Silas and Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">May be delivered;</span> not may "come off victorious whether by life or death" (Calvin), but may be rescued from our enemies. Jowett observes that we have here the shrinking of the flesh from the dangers which awaited the apostle. But there is no trace of cowardice in these words; the apostle desires deliverance, not for his own sake, but for the sake of the free diffusion of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">From unreasonable;</span> a word whose original meaning is "out of place;" then used in an ethical sense, "wicked," "absurd," "unreasonable;" perhaps here applied to persons who will not listen to arguments. <span class="cmt_word">And wicked men</span>. By these unreasonable and wicked men are not to be understood the Jews of Thessalonica, from whom Paul formerly suffered, for their influence would hardly extend to Corinth; nor Christians who were only so in name (Calvin), and specially the Judaizing Christians, for there is no allusion as vet to their attacks upon the apostle; but the fanatical and unbelieving Jews at Corinth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all men have not faith;</span> or, <span class="accented">the faith</span>; <span class="accented">the faith is not the possession of all.</span> Faith here is the Christian faith: all men have not received it - obviously alluding to the unbelieving Jews. The words cannot mean, all men have not the true faith - referring to pretended Christians - false brethren, but secret enemies (Calvin). Nor is it to be rendered "all men have not the capacity of faith." Others understand by faith that upright and candid disposition which would engage men to receive the testimony of the apostle; and others fidelity, as if the apostle meant, "There are few men whom we can trust." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Those who are far apart still may meet together at the throne of grace; and those not able to do or receive any other kindness, may in this way do and receive real and very great kindness. Enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, are unreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and no wonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours to oppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are other evils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to depend upon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performance is sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that was founded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is our sin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects. There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, by the special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not, we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, to obey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to the love of God, and the patience of Christ.</body></html>
