Hitherto he has only been giving directions, without saying why. News had been brought back, no doubt, by the bearers of the First Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">Walk among you disorderly.</span>--A verbal repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>. It is not quite the same as "some among you which walk disorderly," for the words "among you" represent the vague and various <span class= "ital">directions</span> taken by those aimless feet, going about from house to house, workshop to workshop.<p><span class= "bld">Working not at all, but are busybodies.</span>--This is what the disorderliness consists in, as we should have seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a>. There is a scornful play of words here in the Greek which is lost sight of in the English: the word for "busybodies" being merely a compound form of the word "working." Quite literally, the compound means "working enough and to spare," "being overbusy," "overdoing;" then, as a man cannot possibly overdo what it is his own duty to do, it comes to signify (1) doing <span class= "ital">useless</span> things, things which concern no one, and might as well be left alone: as, for instance, magic, which is described by this word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>; or natural science, which is so described in the Athenians' accusation of Socrates! (2) Meddling with matters which do not concern the doer, but do concern other people: so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-13.htm" title="And with they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.">1Timothy 5:13</a>. Prof Lightfoot suggests (<span class= "ital">On a Fresh Revision, </span>p. 59; comp. p. xviii., 2nd ed.) that the play can be kept up through the words "business" and "busy": we might perhaps say, "not being business men, but busybodies." But which of the two notions mentioned above is to be considered most prominent here we cannot tell for certain. (a) The Thessalonians do not seem to have been much carried away by the first class of danger--idle speculations, such as those of the Colossian or Ephesian Churches. Yet we cannot altogether exclude this meaning here. St. Paul's readers had been overbusy in theorising about the position of the departed at Christ's coming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>, Note), and had been so eager over their idle doctrines of the Advent as to falsify, if not actually to forge, communications from St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>). Such false inquisitiveness and gossiping discussions might well be described by the Greek word with which we are dealing. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) Everything, however, points to a more practical form of the same disposition to mask idleness under cloak of work; feverish excitement, which leads men to meddle and interfere with others, perhaps to spend time in "religious" work which ought not to have been spared from every-day duties. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11-12</a>, and Notes.) There is nothing to show definitely how this busy idleness arose, but it may very probably be the shaken and troubled condition of mind spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; the reason for the allusion to this proverb. <span class="cmt_word">We hear.</span> The apostle had either heard from Timothy who had rejoined him from Thessalonica, or from the report of the bearers of the First Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">That there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</span> There is here a paranomasia or play upon words, the words "working" and "busybodies" being cognate. It is difficult to preserve the resemblance in a translation. "Busy only with what is not their own business" (Jowett); "Working at no business, but being busybodies" (Ellicott); "Not busy, but busybodies" (Wordsworth). The word "busybodies" denotes busy in useless and superfluous things, about which one need not trouble himself - occupied about trifles. The apostle refers to the fanatical excitement in the Church on account of which the Thessalonians, instead of occupying themselves with the fulfilment of the duties of their earthly calling, busied themselves about matters which were unprofitable and vain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-15 Those who have received the gospel, are to live according to the gospel. Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.</body></html>
