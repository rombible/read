Paul, as an apostle, had the right of maintenance from the Churches among whom he laboured. This right of support he insists upon in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-18</a>). But for the sake of his converts, to give them an example of diligent working, and to remove every impediment to the progress of the gospel, he often waived his rights. Thus he did at Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6, 9</a>), at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>), and at Ephesus (Acts 20:340; in all these places he laboured for his maintenance as a tent maker. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - we acted so - <span class="cmt_word">to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow</span> - imitate - <span class="cmt_word">us</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-15 Those who have received the gospel, are to live according to the gospel. Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.</body></html>
