Now the writer turns to the orderly brethren, as quite a distinct class. The rhetorical effect of this quick apostrophe would be the same as in the well-known story of Napoleon addressing the rioters, and requesting the gentlemen to separate themselves from the <span class= "ital">canaille.</span> The distinction is so invidious that every one would hasten to join the ranks of the respectable.<p><span class= "bld">Be not weary in</span> <span class= "bld">well doing.</span>--This is an exhortation to "the patience of Christ," for which the Apostle had prayed. The phrase takes for granted that they had been hitherto engaged in "well doing"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in acting honourably, "walking honestly towards them that are without" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm" title="That you may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that you may have lack of nothing.">1Thessalonians 4:12</a>); and St. Paul is anxious to preserve them from "fainting" (as the word is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>), and so slipping into the like idleness and bringing scandal upon the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye, brethren;</span> contrasted with those who walk disorderly, ye who have not neglected your worldly employments. <span class="cmt_word">Be not weary in well doing;</span> or, as it is in the margin, <span class="accented">faint not in well doing</span>; "lose not heart in well doing" (Ellicott). The phrase has been differently interpreted. Thus Chrysostom explains it that indolent persons, however justly they may be condemned, must not be suffered to perish from want - a meaning opposed to the context. Calvin renders it that, although there are many that are undeserving and abuse our liberality, we must not on this account leave off helping those who need our aid: let not the sloth of those disorderly persons hinder or damp your charity - a most needful admonition, but it does not exhaust all that is meant by the precept. Others restrict it to diligence in our earthly duties: though others be idle, working not at all, let not their example lead you astray; be not ye weary in doing what is right and proper (Lunemann). But the phrase is to be understood in its general sense, denoting holy and upright conduct (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, where the same exhortation is given). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-15 Those who have received the gospel, are to live according to the gospel. Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.</body></html>
