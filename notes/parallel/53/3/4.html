St. Chrysostom's whole comment is worth transcription:--"God, saith he, is faithful, and having promised to save, save He assuredly will, but <span class= "ital">as</span> He promised. And how did He promise? If we would be agreeable, and would hear Him; not unconditionally, nor while we remain inactive like stocks and stones. Yet, well has he added his, 'We rely <span class= "ital">in the Lord</span>:' that is, 'We trust to His love of men.' Once more he takes them down, ascribing the whole matter to that quarter; for had he said 'We trust to you,' it would have been a great compliment indeed, but would not have taught them to ascribe all to God; and had he said 'We rely on the Lord that He will keep you,' without adding 'upon you,' and 'that ye both do and will do what things we command,' he would have made them less active by casting the whole upon the power of God." (See the passage of Galatians referred to in the margin.)<p><span class= "bld">Both do and will do.</span>--The emphasis of the sentence is on the future tense, the commendation of the present being only intended to do away the rebuke which might have been conveyed by the future alone. How careful St. Paul is not to wound susceptibilities, though he never "pleases men"! (See, for instance, Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1Thessalonians 4:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1Thessalonians 5:11</a>.) This expression of confidence is a happy rhetorical means of preparing readers for the commands which are to follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we have confidence in the Lord.</span> The apostle confidently expects the obedience of the Thessalonians, but his confidence is not fixed on them - on their own efforts, endeavours, and resolutions - but on the Lord, namely, Christ; on his grace and strength communicated to and perfected in weakness. The obedience of the Thessalonians flowed from the grace of Christ; it was in consequence of the communication of the influences of his Spirit that they were enabled to make progress and to persevere in the Christian life. "Here," observes Professor Jowett, "as elsewhere, the apostle speaks of believing, hoping, doing all things in Christ. We lead an ordinary life as well as a religious one; but, with the apostle, his ordinary life is his religious one, and hence he uses religious expressions in reference to all that he says and does." The apostle lives in the sphere of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Touching you;</span> with reference to you - the direction of his confidence. <span class="cmt_word">That ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</span> There is here the same union of Divine assistance and human effort, of God's working and man's working, which pervades the whole scheme of the gospel salvation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Those who are far apart still may meet together at the throne of grace; and those not able to do or receive any other kindness, may in this way do and receive real and very great kindness. Enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, are unreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and no wonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours to oppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are other evils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to depend upon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performance is sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that was founded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is our sin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects. There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, by the special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not, we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, to obey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to the love of God, and the patience of Christ.</body></html>
