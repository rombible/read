Thus the penalty of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2Thessalonians 1:9</a> is made to appear greater, while at the same time the readers' minds are turned back to a more wholesome subject for meditation.<p><span class= "bld">To be glorified in his saints.</span>--This is not exactly the <span class= "ital">purpose, </span>but the <span class= "ital">effect</span> of His coming. A comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-31.htm" title="Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.">John 13:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm" title="And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.">John 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm" title="That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2Thessalonians 1:12</a>; shows that the saints are the objects <span class= "ital">on</span> which and <span class= "ital">by</span> which the glorious perfection of Christ is exhibited: to see what the saints will be exalted to "in that day" will make all observers acknowledge, not the holiness or greatness of the men, but the divine power of Him who was able so to exalt them. As the persecutors were divided into two classes to be punished, so the saved are described under two aspects: in contrast with "them that know not God" they are "saints," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>fully consecrated to God; in contrast with "them that obey not the gospel" they are "they that believed" (for the past tense is the better reading), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>accepted the gospel. As the profane Gentiles, looking on the saints, recognise the "glory" of the God whom they knew not, so the disobedient Jews, seeing the faithful, are aptly filled with "wonder" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-41.htm" title="Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it to you.">Acts 13:41</a>), before they perish, at the glory to be attained by obedience to the law of suffering.<p><span class= "bld">Because our testimony.</span>--Introduced to show why the writers had said specially "in all them that believed" (the past tense is employed because it looks back from the Judgment Day to the moment when the gospel was offered and the divergence between believers and unbelievers began); the reason was, because among "all them that believed" the Thessalonians would be found included.<p><span class= "bld">In that day.</span>--Added at the end to make the readers look once more (as it were) upon the wonderful sight on which the writer's prophetic eyes were raptly fixed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span>; defining the period when this judgment of the wicked will occur. <span class="cmt_word">He</span>; namely, the Lord Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">Shall come to be glorified;</span> the purpose of his coming. <span class="cmt_word">In</span>; not "through," or "among," but "in," as the sphere or element of his glory. <span class="cmt_word">His saints;</span> not the holy angels who will accompany him to judgment, but holy men whom he has redeemed with his blood. Christ will be glorified in his saints, inasmuch as their glory was the result of his sufferings and death, and their holiness is the reflection of his holiness; "They will reflect as in a mirror the glory of the Lord." <span class="cmt_word">And to be admired;</span> wondered at, praised. <span class="cmt_word">In all them that believe;</span> or, <span class="accented">believed.</span> The work of faith is past; the result of faith, the state of sight and glory, has commenced. The glorification of believers will thus become the glorification of Christ. The glory of Christ does not arise from the punishment of the wicked, but from the glorification of believers. Christ will indeed be glorified in the punishment of the wicked. His justice will be manifested and vindicated; but his glory will be especially seen in the manifestation of his mercy toward believers. <span class="cmt_word">Because our testimony;</span> namely, the testimony of Paul and his associates, Silas and Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">Among you;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">unto you. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Was believed;</span> to be considered as a parenthesis. <span class="cmt_word">In that day;</span> namely, the day of the Lord's advent, to be connected with the commencement of the verse, "In that day when he shall come to be glorified in his saints." Some, overlooking the parenthesis, render the words either, "because our testimony concerning that day was believed among you;" or, "because our testimony among you shall be believed on that day" - assented to by the whole universe; but the first rendering gives a false meaning to the preposition, and the second a false construction to the verb, as if it were future. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Religion, if worth anything, is worth every thing; and those have no religion, or none worth having, or know not how to value it, cannot find their hearts to suffer for it. We cannot by all our sufferings, any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience under sufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more strongly marks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmity to the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble his people. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin and sorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by the righteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wicked men, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, is enabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appears confused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear from heaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. His light will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that day shall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those that know not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crime of multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; or if they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truths of the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel. Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. They did sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinners by creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from the Almighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful day to some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. In that bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admired by his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. His grace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he has purchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe in him. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, how much more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! The glory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired, but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. How will this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transport thy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shall enjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here; Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believer not excepted.</body></html>
