The indication of God's righteous judgment consisted not so much in the vitality and growth of the Thessalonians' faith and love as in the very fact of their being persecuted; such persecution was an actual indication how the fair judgment of God would go in the last day. No undue stress is to be laid upon the epithet "righteous," as if it were "a token of the <span class= "ital">righteousness of</span> God's judgment;" the point is only to indicate already <span class= "ital">what</span> a fair judge was likely to decide.<p><span class= "bld">That ye may be counted worthy.</span>--This expresses the result, not of the future judgment of God, but of the patient sufferings which reveal what that judgment will be. The "counting worthy" (or rather, perhaps, the "<span class= "ital">declaring</span> worthy") is, in fact, the "judgment" or sentence itself. "You suffer in such a manner that we can forecast the fair verdict of God: viz., so as to be then declared (the Greek tense points to a distinct moment of forming the estimate) fit to receive God's kingdom." The word "counted worthy" has in this place nothing to do with the theological question of merit.<p><span class= "bld">The kingdom of God.</span>--Which had formed a prominent feature of the first preaching at Thessalonica. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to the First Epistle to the Thessalonians.</span>) Are the Thessalonian Christians, then, not yet in the kingdom of God? Yes; but only as its <span class= "ital">subjects:</span> hereafter they are to be counted worthy not of admission into it, but of it itself--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to inherit it, to become kings of it. (Comp. the parallel argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2Timothy 2:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For which ye also suffer.</span>--St. Paul is very fond of this "also" in relative clauses; it tightens the coupling between the relative and antecedent clauses, and so brings out more clearly the vital connection between suffering and reigning. They suffer "for the kingdom," not merely for the sake of winning it, but on its behalf, in defence of it, in consequence of being its citizens, to extend its dominion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Which is <span class="cmt_word">a manifest token.</span> A sentence in apposition, so that the words, "which is," printed in italics, ought to be omitted. By "token" is here meant pledge or proof. The reference is not simply to the Thessalonians, but to the whole clause - to the fact of the Thessalonians steadfastly enduring persecutions and affliction; in other words, to their sufferings for the sake of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Of the righteous</span> - just - <span class="cmt_word">judgment of God.</span> Not to be referred to the present state, and particularly to sufferings perfecting the Thessalonians and preparing them for the kingdom of God (Olshausen); but to the future judgment. These words imply that the sufferings of the righteous and the prosperity of their wicked persecutors was a clear proof that there shall be a future state of retribution, when the inequalities of the present state of things will be adjusted, when the apparent violations of justice will be rectified, and when matters will be completely reversed - when the persecutors will be punished and the persecuted rewarded (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28</a>, "And in nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation and that of God"). <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; in order that, indicating the purpose of God's dispensation. <span class="cmt_word">Ye may be counted worthy.</span> Paul here finds, in the faith and patience of the Thessalonians amid persecution, an evidence of a state of reward, as well as in the cruelties of their persecutors an evidence of a state of punishment. The idea that man can merit salvation as a reward from God is not contained in this passage. As all men are sinners, salvation can only be obtained through the merits and mediation of Christ. But with this grace of God, justice is not abolished; the righteous will be rewarded for their faith and patience (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kingdom of God;</span> namely, the Messianic kingdom which Christ will establish at the advent: here the heavenly state. <span class="cmt_word">For which;</span> for the sake of which. <span class="cmt_word">Ye also suffer;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">are sufferin</span>g; the sufferings being continued down to the time when the apostle wrote this Epistle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Religion, if worth anything, is worth every thing; and those have no religion, or none worth having, or know not how to value it, cannot find their hearts to suffer for it. We cannot by all our sufferings, any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience under sufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more strongly marks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmity to the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble his people. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin and sorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by the righteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wicked men, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, is enabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appears confused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear from heaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. His light will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that day shall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those that know not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crime of multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; or if they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truths of the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel. Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. They did sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinners by creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from the Almighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful day to some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. In that bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admired by his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. His grace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he has purchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe in him. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, how much more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! The glory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired, but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. How will this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transport thy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shall enjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here; Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believer not excepted.</body></html>
