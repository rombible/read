Possibly, because it seemed almost like self-praise to praise their own converts; but much more probably, because the writers had before felt and expressed misgivings on the point: this suits the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2Thessalonians 1:3</a> better.<p><span class= "bld">Glory in you in the churches of God.</span>--Not only in thanksgiving to God (though, perhaps, outbursts of praise in the public services of "the churches" may be included), but also in talking to other men, at Corinth and elsewhere: so, in return, St. Paul "boasted" to the Thessalonians about the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2Corinthians 9:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Your patience and faith.</span>--It was well proved that St. Paul had no more cause for misgiving, and that the tempter's tempting by persecution had not made the apostolic labours to be in vain. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1Thessalonians 3:5</a>.) "Patience," in the New Testament, does not mean a meek submissiveness, but a heroic endurance. The "faith" here becomes almost equivalent to "hope," except that it introduces the <span class= "ital">ground</span> of such hope: viz., confidence in the living God; it also includes the notion of <span class= "ital">faithfulness.</span><p><span class= "bld">Persecutions and tribulations.</span>--The difference-between the two words is, that while "tribulation" is quite general, and implies no personal enmities, "persecution" means that a certain set of persons were organising active measures for the annoyance of the Church. Such persecution they were still "enduring" when the Letter was written.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So that we ourselves.</span> "We" - Paul and Silas and Timothy, the founders of the Church of Thessalonica. "We ourselves," not merely we of our own accord (Hofmann), but we as well as our informants, who brought us this intelligence of the increase of your faith and love. <span class="cmt_word">Glory in</span> <span class="cmt_word">you in the Churches of God;</span> that is, in those Churches with which we come in contact; namely, the Church at Corinth and the Churches in Achaia. It would appear from this that several Churches had been founded in Achaia, as, for example, the Church of Cenchrea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For your patience and faith;</span> not to be weakened as a Hebraism for "your patient faith," or "for the patience of your faith;" nor is faith to be taken in the sense of faithfulness or fidelity (Lunemann); but, as in the previous verse, it denotes "faith in Christ." Patience is steadfast endurance, which, in order to be of any value in the sight of God, must be combined with faith; stoical endurance is not here nor anywhere else inculcated in Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">In all your persecutions and tribulations</span> - afflictions - <span class="cmt_word">that ye endure;</span> or, are enduring; the persecution which arose when Paul was at Thessalonica being continued. The patience and faith of the Thessalonians shone the more brilliantly amid persecution and affliction, even as the stars shine brightest in the dark night. To be a true Christian in the time of peace is a great matter; but to be a true Christian in the season of persecution is a greater; faith is then tested in the furnace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Where there is the truth of grace, there will be an increase of it. The path of the just is as the shining light, which shines more and more unto the perfect day. And where there is the increase of grace, God must have all the glory. Where faith grows, love will abound, for faith works by love. It shows faith and patience, such as may be proposed as a pattern for others, when trials from God, and persecutions from men, quicken the exercise of those graces; for the patience and faith of which the apostle gloried, bore them up, and enabled them to endure all their tribulations.</body></html>
