The flaming fire here is not the instrument of the vengeance--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>hell-fire--but the common pictorial attribute of the Divine Presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.">Exodus 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm" title="And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Taking vengeance.</span>--The expression in the original is one which is said to be found nowhere else in Greek literature, save in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-14.htm" title="And I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 25:14</a> (though in Hebrew there is an almost exact equivalent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-3.htm" title="And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves to the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.">Numbers 31:3</a>), so that it is difficult to assign the correct meaning. It certainly does <span class= "ital">not</span> mean "taking vengeance" in the sense of "taking His revenge," as though our Lord had conceived a personal grudge and were wreaking it. What it does mean would seem to be "assigning retribution:" appointing, that is, to each man what satisfaction of justice he must make. The very word for "vengeance" can only mean vengeance exacted on some one else's behalf. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm" title="Why should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of your servants which is shed.">Psalm 79:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">On them that know not God.</span>--According to the Greek, the word "them" should be repeated also in the next clause. The effect will then be to mark off the culprits into two classes: "them that know not," and "them that obey not." A comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17-18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1Thessalonians 4:5</a>, shows that by the first class are meant Gentiles; a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias said, Lord, who has believed our report?">Romans 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm" title="But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.">Romans 10:21</a> (and many other passages) will show disobedience to be the characteristic of the Jews. The Greek negative particle here is one which shows that the ignorance of the one set and the disobedience of the other were just the points for which they were to be punished: therefore, of course, only those Gentiles whose ignorance was voluntary, who chose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>) to be Gentiles when they might have been joined to the true God, are objects of wrath. Here, as the context shows, St. Paul is thinking chiefly of those Gentiles and Jews who actually persecuted the truth.<p><span class= "bld">Obey not the gospel.</span>--A noteworthy phrase; see the reference. The gospel, the "glad tidings," contains not only a statement of facts, but also a call to obey a law which is the outcome of the facts. Even the acceptance of evangelical promises requires a submission. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-47.htm" title="And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.">Luke 24:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm" title="When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life.">Acts 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a>.) It is here called specially the gospel "of our Lord Jesus Christ," because the sin of the Jews (who constitute this class of sinners) consisted precisely in the wilful rejection of Jesus as the Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In flaming fire;</span> not the instrument of punishment - "in flaming fire taking vengeance;" but a further description of the glory of Christ's appearance - "revealed in flaming fire." In the Old Testament God is represented as appearing in flaming fire, as when he manifested himself to Moses in the burning bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>); and especially his coming to judgment is represented as coming in fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-3.htm">Psalm 97:3</a>). What is there asserted of God is here referred to Christ (comp. Revelation 19:22). There is also a probable reference to the Shechinah or cloud of glory in which Christ will appear for judgment trey. 1:7). Some also suppose a reference to the fire of the universal conflagration which shall usher in the last day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>), and others to the fire which shall consume the ungodly, but it is best to restrict the expression to the glory of Christ's manifestation. <span class="cmt_word">Taking vengeance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">giving</span>; that is, awarding or allotting vengeance, representing the act, not of a conqueror or of an avenger, but of a righteous Judge. <span class="cmt_word">On them that know not Go</span>d - the unbelieving Gentiles - <span class="cmt_word">and that;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">on them that</span>; a second class being here denoted. <span class="cmt_word">Obey not the gospel of our Lord Jests Christ;</span> namely, the unbelieving Jews. The ignorance of the one and the disobedience of the other were the causes of their punishment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Religion, if worth anything, is worth every thing; and those have no religion, or none worth having, or know not how to value it, cannot find their hearts to suffer for it. We cannot by all our sufferings, any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience under sufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more strongly marks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmity to the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble his people. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin and sorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by the righteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wicked men, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, is enabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appears confused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear from heaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. His light will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that day shall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those that know not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crime of multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; or if they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truths of the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel. Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. They did sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinners by creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from the Almighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful day to some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. In that bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admired by his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. His grace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he has purchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe in him. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, how much more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! The glory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired, but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. How will this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transport thy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shall enjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here; Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believer not excepted.</body></html>
