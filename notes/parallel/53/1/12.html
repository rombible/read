Seeing the favours bestowed upon the Christians in the last day, all, the lost as well as the saved, will be forced to acknowledge the glory (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the divine perfection) of the Jesus whose Christship had been rejected, and the glory (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the true dignity) of the Christians who had been despised for their allegiance to Him.

The words "according to the grace" belong only to "and ye in Him:" it is the gracious will (for "grace" here has hardly its strict theological sense) of God, in which Christ concurs, that we should be thus "glorified in Him."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> or simply, <span class="accented">of our Lord Jesus</span>, "Christ" not being in the original. The "name of our Lord Jesus" is not a mere periphrasis for the Lord Jesus himself, but the name denotes his nature and character. The second petition of our Lord's prayer is "Hallowed be thy Name," and this the apostle applies to Christ; he prays that his Name may be hallowed among the Thessalonians - an incidental proof of his divinity. <span class="cmt_word">May be glorified in you, and you in him;</span> a twofold glorification: Christ is glorified in believers, when by their holiness they promote his cause and reflect his glory; and believers are glorified in Christ, when they receive out of his infinite fulness. <span class="cmt_word">According to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Some suppose that the epithet "God" also belongs to Jesus Christ, but the construction hardly bears this meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11,12 Believing thoughts and expectations of the second coming of Christ should lead us to pray to God more, for ourselves and others. If there is any good in us, it is owing to the good pleasure of his goodness, and therefore it is called grace. There are many purposes of grace and good-will in God toward his people, and the apostle prays that God would complete in them the work of faith with power. This is to their doing every other good work. The power of God not only begins, but carries on the work of faith. And this is the great end and design of the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ, which is made known to us, and wrought in us.</body></html>
