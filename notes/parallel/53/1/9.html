But the word "destruction" does not stand absolutely and alone as a synonym for "annihilation." This passage, in itself, gives us no reason to suppose that the lost will be "destroyed" in the ordinary sense of the word. They are to be <span class= "ital">"</span>destroyed <span class= "ital">from the presence</span> of the Lord, and from the glory of His power"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>cut off from it for ever. The "presence"--or, more literally here, "<span class= "ital">the face</span>--of the Lord," as well as "the glory of His power," is a metaphor from the courts of Oriental kings, where only honoured courtiers are admitted to spend their time in the immediate and familiar presence of the sovereign. Familiar contact with Christ hereafter, which will be accorded to all the saved, was God's ideal intention for the lost as well, therefore it is a positive "destruction" to be banished from it. But to the Jews, who looked for a Messiah who should keep regal state, the punishment was peculiarly appropriate. The word is used besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>. As for the word rendered "everlasting" (or <span class= "ital">eternal, </span>for it is the same which is used, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>), it would certainly convey to St. Paul's readers the notion of <span class= "ital">incessant duration in time;</span> it is, of course, only an adaptation to human language to speak of time at all in such a case, as we cannot tell what may take the place of time in the next dispensation; however, so far as the actual words go, there is nothing in these passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm" title="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm" title="And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm" title="But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.">Mark 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-7.htm" title="Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.">Jude 1:7</a>) to suggest any future alteration in the state of the lost. In this, as in some other doctrines, there seem to be two distinct sets of passages, the logical reconciliation of which in our present state seems almost impossible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who</span>; namely, the unbelieving Gentiles and Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be punished;</span> literally, <span class="accented">shall pay the penalty</span>; <span class="accented">shall suffer punishment</span> (R.V.). <span class="cmt_word">With everlasting destruction;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">even everlasting destruction</span>; the words being in apposition. "Destruction" here denotes ruin, death; the word is only used in Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>). The Greek word translated "everlasting," from dogmatic reasons, has given rise to much controversy. Here it appears to denote eternal - eternity to come. The eternal punishment of the wicked seems here asserted; a terrible declaration, which the mind shudders to contemplate. The observation of Olshausen is worthy of attention: "This is the only passage in Paul's Epistles in which everlasting damnation is openly declared, whereas not a few occur in which a bringing back of all the lost ones is apparently assumed as possible;" but he adds, "For the supposition that Paul did indeed in the earliest of his Epistles still teach everlasting damnation, but gave it up in later times, there exists no sufficient foundation, because the bringing back again is nowhere freely and openly declared." <span class="cmt_word">From the presence</span> (or, <span class="accented">face</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord.</span> This clause has received a threefold interpretation. Some (De Wette, Hofmann) take the preposition "from" in a causal sense, denoting the efficient cause of the punishment of the wicked - that they will be as it were blasted by the face of the Lord. Others (Chrysostom, Theophylact) take it in a temporal sense, denoting the swiftness of the punishment of the wicked - that their punishment will rise directly on the appearance of Christ (Lunemann, Alford). And others take it in a local sense, denoting banishment or separation - that the wicked will be expelled from that joy and glory which reign in the presence of Christ; they shall be banished away from the presence of the Lord. This last interpretation seems to be the correct meaning; it gives to the proposition its full force. <span class="cmt_word">And from the glory of his power;</span> not a Hebraism for "his mighty glory" (Jowett), but from that glory which has its origin in his power - the wicked will be banished from the manifestation of his power in the glorification of his saints. The punishment of the wicked on its negative side is here stated. As the presence of the glorified Jesus will constitute the happiness of heaven, so banishment from his presence will constitute the misery of hell, because the soul is then cut off from the source of all good and of all holiness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Religion, if worth anything, is worth every thing; and those have no religion, or none worth having, or know not how to value it, cannot find their hearts to suffer for it. We cannot by all our sufferings, any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience under sufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more strongly marks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmity to the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble his people. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin and sorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by the righteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wicked men, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, is enabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appears confused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear from heaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. His light will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that day shall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those that know not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crime of multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; or if they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truths of the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel. Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. They did sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinners by creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from the Almighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful day to some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. In that bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admired by his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. His grace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he has purchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe in him. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, how much more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! The glory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired, but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. How will this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transport thy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shall enjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here; Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believer not excepted.</body></html>
