The best paraphrase would be: "We <span class= "ital">feel</span> the obligation to give thanks for you; and, in point of fact, it is but meet that we <span class= "ital">should, </span>because," &c.<p><span class= "bld">Groweth exceedingly.</span>--An enthusiastic word in the original: "is out-growing all bounds." It is a metaphor from vegetable or animal growth. This was one of the very points about which St. Paul was anxious the last time that he had written: then there were deficiencies in their faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Charity.</span>--Here, too, St. Paul remembers what he had said to them in the last Epistle, in which he had devoted a whole section to the love of the brethren "toward each other." "Of every one of you all" is a very noticeable expression, as showing the individual solicitude of the Apostles for their converts. Just as the apostolic instructions were given to each Christian privately (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,">1Thessalonians 2:11</a>), so news has been brought how each several Christian is progressing. The differences which had called forth such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1Thessalonians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1Thessalonians 5:12-14</a>, had apparently all ceased, and mutual love was multiplying.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span>. Not to be restricted to Paul, the plural being used for the singular, as is elsewhere the case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>); but inclusive of Silas and Timothy, inasmuch as they are mentioned directly before (see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are bound;</span> feel ourselves morally constrained. <span class="cmt_word">To thank God always for you,</span> brethren (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). The apostle first praises his converts for what good was in them, before he censures them for their faults, and in this manner he secures their attention. <span class="cmt_word">As it is meet;</span> as it is right and proper in the circumstances of the case. The words are not to be considered as a parenthetic clause, far less as a tautological expression (Jowett); but they state that the reason of the apostle's thanksgiving arose from the spiritual condition of the Thessalonians; "with the acknowledgment of personal obligation, Paul joins a recognition of the circumstances of the case" (Hofinann). <span class="cmt_word">Because that your faith groweth exceedingly</span> - superabounds - <span class="cmt_word">and the charity of every one of you all.</span> The subject of the apostle's thanksgiving was the increase of the faith and love of the Thessalonians: faith here being faith in Christ, and love being love to man. Faith and love contain in themselves the whole of the Christian life; faith is its commencement, its source; love is not only its outcome, its spiritual action, but its completion; the climax of the Christian life is to be made perfect in love. Here, however, love is restricted by the context to love to believers, or brotherly love. <span class="cmt_word">Toward each other;</span> that is, toward your fellow Christians in Thessalonica. Love is not a mere general affection, but is to be specially manifested - "toward each believer." <span class="cmt_word">Aboundeth</span>; increaseth in intensity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Where there is the truth of grace, there will be an increase of it. The path of the just is as the shining light, which shines more and more unto the perfect day. And where there is the increase of grace, God must have all the glory. Where faith grows, love will abound, for faith works by love. It shows faith and patience, such as may be proposed as a pattern for others, when trials from God, and persecutions from men, quicken the exercise of those graces; for the patience and faith of which the apostle gloried, bore them up, and enabled them to endure all their tribulations.</body></html>
