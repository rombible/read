The "also" serves to emphasise the "pray": we do not content ourselves with merely hoping, but we direct actual prayer to that end. The word "whereunto" seems grammatically to depend upon the word "calling"--"of the calling whereunto, we <span class= "ital">pray</span> also for you always, that our God would count you worthy."<p><span class= "bld">Count you worthy of this calling.</span>--The word "this" would, perhaps, have been, better left out; the "calling" of which St. Paul is thinking is the calling "in that day," such as is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:">Matthew 25:34</a>, and the act is the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:">2Thessalonians 1:5</a>. But had they not been called to glory already? Yes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1Thessalonians 4:7</a>), and had obeyed the call; and God was still calling them hourly (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm" title="Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it.">1Thessalonians 5:24</a>); but that was no security that they would remain worthy of that last decisive call. "Many are called, but few chosen." In the original there is some, emphasis laid on the pronoun: "count <span class= "ital">you"</span><p><span class= "bld">Fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">fulfil every purpose of goodness;</span> or, "everything which beneficence deems good." Most modern commentators take the "goodness" to be the goodness of the Thessalonians themselves, thus making the clause logically antecedent to the foregoing:" May count you worthy of His calling, and (for that purpose) fulfil every good moral aspiration you may entertain." But this seems unnecessary. The "beneficence" is used absolutely, in almost a personified sense; it is, of course, in reality, God's beneficence, but is spoken of as beneficence in the abstract. Thus the clause preserves its natural place as an explanation of the preceding:" May finally call you. and there accomplish upon your persons all that beneficence can devise."<p><span class= "bld">And the work of faith with power.</span>--This work, too, is God's work, not the work of the Thessalonians. It is used in the same sense as a like phrase in Cowper's well-known hymn--<p>"Thou shalt see My glory soon,<p>When <span class= "ital">the work of grace</span> is done."<p>It means, not "perfect your faithful activity," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1Thessalonians 1:3</a>, but "bring to its mighty consummation the work that faith was able to effect in you." Faith, therefore, is here opposed as much to sight as to unbelief. The "beneficence" and the "power" thus exerted upon (rather than through) the Thessalonians. produces upon all spectators of the judgment, both angels and men, the effect described in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>; with a view to this consummation, in order that Christ may be glorified in you. <span class="cmt_word">We pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">of your calling</span> (R.V.). The calling was, properly speaking, only the commencement of the Christian life, but as it was the first link in a chain that terminated in glory, it is used to denote the whole Christian life - your vocation as Christians. <span class="cmt_word">And fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness.</span> The pronoun "his" is not in the original. The words have been differently rendered: some render them "all God's pleasure in our goodness;" others restrict both words to mean "every desire of goodness" (R.V.). <span class="cmt_word">And the work of faith;</span> that faith which is active, living, productive of good works (see exposition on 1 Thessalonians 1:3). <span class="cmt_word">With power;</span> or, <span class="accented">in power</span>; to be taken adverbially, and to be connected with the verb "fulfil:" "That God would mightily fulfil in you all moral goodness, and a faith which is energetic." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11,12 Believing thoughts and expectations of the second coming of Christ should lead us to pray to God more, for ourselves and others. If there is any good in us, it is owing to the good pleasure of his goodness, and therefore it is called grace. There are many purposes of grace and good-will in God toward his people, and the apostle prays that God would complete in them the work of faith with power. This is to their doing every other good work. The power of God not only begins, but carries on the work of faith. And this is the great end and design of the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ, which is made known to us, and wrought in us.</body></html>
