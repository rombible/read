nor is it easy to see why Nebuchadrezzar should have chosen it as a place for his throne. It seems better, with Hitzig, Furst, and others, to take the Hebrew word, which occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm" title="And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.">2Samuel 12:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-14.htm" title="Draw you waters for the siege, fortify your strong holds: go into clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brick kiln.">Nahum 3:14</a>, as meaning a structure of brick, a <span class= "ital">dais </span>or raised <span class= "ital">pavement, </span>like the Gabbatha or Pavement on which Pilate sat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.">John 19:13</a>), in front of the entrance of the palace, on which the king naturally placed his throne when he sat in judgment or received petitions. Assyrian and Babylonian monuments present many instances of kings thus seated. As making his prediction more vivid, the prophet places stones in the <span class= "ital">mortar </span>or <span class= "ital">cement </span>(not "clay") with which the mass was covered, and conceals them apparently with a fresh coat of mortar. There they were to remain till his prediction should be fulfilled. The symbolic act was of the same type as the breaking of the potter's vessel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10</a>, and the yoke worn on the prophet's shoulders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,">Jeremiah 27:2</a>), and Ezekiel's digging through the wall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm" title="And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I dig through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it on my shoulder in their sight.">Ezekiel 12:7</a>). It may be noted that our version follows Luther in translating "brickkiln." The LXX. evades the difficulty by taking refuge in vague terms" in the vestibule (<span class= "greekheb">???????</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>in the gate of the house," and the Vulgate gives "in the crypt which is under the brick walls."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take great stones,</span> etc. A strange symbolic act of Jeremiah's is here described. "We must not suppose, arguing from our Western and precise notions, that he would be at all necessarily interfered with. In fact, he would have a twofold security, as a prophet of God to those who acknowledged him as such, and in the opinion of others as insane, and, according to Eastern ideas, thus especially under Divine promptings in his acts" (Streane). He is directed to take great stones and embed them in the mortar (not "clay") in the brick pavement at the entry of the palace. When the events predicted came to pass, these stones would testify that Jeremiah had predicted them. The word rendered "brick pavement" is of doubtful meaning. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-14.htm">Nahum 3:14</a> it signifies "brick kiln." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:8-13 God can find his people wherever they are. The Spirit of prophecy was not confined to the land of Israel. It is foretold that Nebuchadnezzar should destroy and carry into captivity many of the Egyptians. Thus God makes one wicked man, or wicked nation, a scourge and plague to another. He will punish those who deceive his professing people, or tempt them to rebellion.</body></html>
