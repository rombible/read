Jehovah Himself kindles the fire which is to destroy the temples of the gods of Egypt, and the Chaldaean king is but His instrument.<p><span class= "bld">As a shepherd putteth on his garment.</span>--The words may point simply to the easiness of the conquest. To take possession of the whole country will be as quick and light a matter as when the shepherd takes up his garment at night and wraps it round him. Possibly (as Hitzig suggests) there may be a reference to the fact that when the shepherd so wraps himself he turns the fleecy coat which he wears inside out (the "<span class= "ital">pellibus inversis" o</span>f Juvenal, <span class= "ital">Sat. xiv.</span> 136). So, the prophet may suggest, shall the conqueror turn the whole land upside down. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm" title="And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.">2Kings 21:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Burn them;</span> viz. the temples. Egypt was full of gorgeous and imposing temples, which could not, however, always be burned, nor were the conquerors of Egypt anxious to display hostility to Egyptian religion. <span class="cmt_word">Carry them away captives;</span> viz. the idol gods (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, "Chemosh shall no forth into captivity:" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm">Isaiah 46:2</a>, "Their soul [or, 'personality'] hath gone into captivity"). The prophet speaks from the point of view of a believer in the idol gods. <span class="cmt_word">He shall array himself with the land of Egypt,</span> etc. (For "array himself with" and "putteth on,"<span class="accented">read wrap himself in</span> and <span class="accented">wrappeth himself in.</span>) Ewald well explains this figure. "As easily as the shepherd in the open field wraps himself in the cool night in his mantle, will he be able to grasp Egypt with his hand and fling it round him like an easily managed garment, in order then to leave the land as an absolute conqueror, clothed in this attire of booty, in peace, without an enemy." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:8-13 God can find his people wherever they are. The Spirit of prophecy was not confined to the land of Israel. It is foretold that Nebuchadnezzar should destroy and carry into captivity many of the Egyptians. Thus God makes one wicked man, or wicked nation, a scourge and plague to another. He will punish those who deceive his professing people, or tempt them to rebellion.</body></html>
