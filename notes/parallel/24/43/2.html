Possibly, however, as suggested above, the two names represent brothers who were both prominent as leaders of the people. Here, we may note, he takes precedence of Johanan, probably as the chief spokesman of the prevailing discontent. The special mention of "all the proud men" suggests the thought that there were some who, left to themselves, would have been willing to follow the prophet's counsel. Those who join in the protest content themselves with a flat denial of his inspiration, and charge him, as he had been charged before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>), with sinister intentions. It is suggestive, in connexion with the view taken in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-17.htm" title="So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.">Jeremiah 42:17</a>, that the LXX., following apparently a different reading of the Hebrew, gives "all the aliens" instead of "all the proud."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the proud men.</span> It would seem as if the "proud men" were distinguished from others. Jeremiah had called the whole people together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-8.htm">Jeremiah 42:8</a>); but a few domineering men assumed to represent the rest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-7 Only by pride comes contention, both with God and man. They preferred their own wisdom to the revealed will of God. Men deny the Scriptures to be the word of God, because they are resolved not to conform themselves to Scripture rules. When men will persist in sin, they charge the best actions to bad motives. These Jews deserted their own land, and threw themselves out of God's protection. It is the folly of men, that they often ruin themselves by wrong endeavours to mend their situation.</body></html>
