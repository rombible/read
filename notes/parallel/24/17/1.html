The words describe a note of infamy that could not be erased, and this was stamped in upon the tablets of the heart (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2Corinthians 3:3</a>), and blazoned upon the "horns of the altars" of their false worship, or of the true worship of Jehovah which they had polluted and rendered false. The plural "altars" points probably to the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sin of Judah</span>, etc. "Judah's sin" is not merely their tendency to sin, but their sinful practices - their idolatry. This is said to be <span class="cmt_word">graven upon the table of their heart</span>, for it is no mere form, but carried on with passionate earnestness, and as indelible as if engraved <span class="cmt_word">with an iron pen.</span> How unlike, however, is this record to that of which the same expression is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a>! <span class="cmt_word">With the point of a diamond</span>; or, <span class="accented">with a point of adamant</span> (harder than flint, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-9.htm">Ezekiel 3:9</a> says). Fragments of adamant, says Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:15), are sought out by engravers and enclosed in iron; they easily overcome every hardness. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the horns of your altars.</span> First of all, what altars are referred to? Those erected for the worship of idols or the two in the temple of Jehovah, which had been defiled by idolatry? And why is the sin of Judah said to be engraved upon the horns of the altars? Probably because the "horns," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the projections at the four upper corners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>) were smeared with the blood of the victims. The direction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a> was doubtless not peculiar to the ritual of the Law. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-4 The sins which men commit make little impression on their minds, yet every sin is marked in the book of God; they are all so graven upon the table of the heart, that they will all be remembered by the conscience. That which is graven in the heart will become plain in the life; men's actions show the desires and purposes of their hearts. What need we have to humble ourselves before God, who are so vile in his sight! How should we depend on his mercy and grace, begging of God to search and prove us; not to suffer us to be deceived by our own hearts, but to create in us a clean and holy nature by his Spirit!</body></html>
