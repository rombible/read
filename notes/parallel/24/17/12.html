It seems to us, no doubt, singular thus practically to identify, Jehovah and his temple; but the prophet s meaning is that God can only be addressed in so far as he has revealed himself. The temple was not, strictly speaking, the "Name or revelation of God, but it was "the place of the Name of Jehovah," and in the language of strong feeling might be addressed as if it were really the Divine Name. The disciples of the incarnate Name were familiar with the idea that their Master was in some sense the antitype of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>). In proposing this explanation, it has been tacitly assumed that the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">A glorious high throne... is the place of our sanctuary</span>, is wrong. Grammatically, indeed, it is not indefensible; but it is a weak rendering in such a context. Render, therefore, Thou <span class="accented">throne of glory</span>, <span class="accented">a height from the beginning</span>, <span class="accented">thou place of our sanctuary</span>, <span class="accented">thou hope of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>. The temple is called "the throne of thy glory" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a>; "height" is a common synonym for heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8, Hebrew</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, Hebrew), but is also applied to Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>, quoted by Keil), which is also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a> called, "the place of my sanctuary." By adding the concluding words of the address (at the opening of ver. 13), the prophet prevents the suspicion that he attached importance to the mere outward buildings of the temple, like those formalist Jews, whose words are quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:12-18 The prophet acknowledges the favour of God in setting up religion. There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name. His hands can bind up the troubled conscience, and heal the broken heart; he can cure the worst diseases of our nature.</body></html>
