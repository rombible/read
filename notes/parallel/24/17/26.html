(1) The "plain" (<span class= "ital">Shephelah</span>) is the lowland country of Philistia, stretching to the Mediterranean; the "mountain" the hill-country of Judah; the "south" (<span class= "ital">Negeb</span>) the region lying to the south of Hebron, and including Beersheba (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm" title="And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,">Joshua 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-28.htm" title="And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,">Joshua 15:28</a>). Each name, though descriptive in meaning, was used in almost as definite a sense as that in which we speak of the "Campagna" of Rome or the "Weald" of Kent. (2) The list includes the <span class= "ital">"</span>burnt offerings," in which the flesh of the victim was consumed entirely on the altar; the "sacrifices," in which the flesh of the victim was eaten partly by the priest and partly by the worshipper; the "meat offerings," which were of meal and salt, not of flesh, and were always accompanied by incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1</a>); and, lastly, praise--the word "sacrifice" not being found in the Hebrew--the utterance of prayer and psalm, which the Psalmist had named as more acceptable than the flesh of bulls and goats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm" title="Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay your vows to the most High:">Psalm 50:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Parallel passage for the catalogue of the districts of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>.

The sacrifices are described with equal explicitness; they fall into two classes, the bloody (burnt offerings and other sacrifices) and the unbloody (the vegetable offering or <span class="accented">minkhah</span>, and the incense which was strewed upon the <span class="accented">min</span>-<span class="accented">khah</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bringing sacrifices of praise</span>.

St. Paul says, "In everything give thanks;" and this seems to have been the prophet's ideal of the sacrifices of the future. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:19-27 The prophet was to lay before the rulers and the people of Judah, the command to keep holy the sabbath day. Let them strictly observe the fourth command. If they obeyed this word, their prosperity should be restored. It is a day of rest, and must not be made a day of labour, unless in cases of necessity. Take heed, watch against the profanation of the sabbath. Let not the soul be burdened with the cares of this world on sabbath days. The streams of religion run deep or shallow, according as the banks of the sabbath are kept up or neglected. The degree of strictness with which this ordinance is observed, or the neglect shown towards it, is a good test to find the state of spiritual religion in any land. Let all; by their own example, by attention to their families, strive to check this evil, that national prosperity may be preserved, and, above all, that souls may be saved.</body></html>
