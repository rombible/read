As it would be very unnatural for a public orator to appeal to the yet unborn members of the reigning dynasty, and as there are several indications that the "house of David" was able at this period, as also in that of Isaiah, to exercise a decisive political and civil influence, even, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-11.htm">Jeremiah 21:11, 12</a>, monopolizing the judicial functions, it is natural to suppose that "kings of Judah" is here used in a very special sense, via. of the members of the various branches of the royal family ("The sons of the <span class="accented">king</span>," <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-26.htm">Jeremiah 36:26</a>, "Jerahmeel, a king's son"), and their descendants, who received the royal title by courtesy (parallels for this will be found in Gesenius's 'Hebrew Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.<span class="accented">me'lek</span>). The queen-mother was probably the leader of this plan; "the mistress," as she was called (see on Jeremiah 13:18), and the royal princes (among whom the "house of Nathan," <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a>, would doubtless be reckoned), constituted in fact a body almost as numerous as they did (according to Brugsch Bey) in Egypt, and politically much more influential; so much so indeed that only a king of unusual force of character, like Hezekiah or Josiah, could venture, and that timidly, to oppose them. The weak-principled Zedekiah seems to have been entirely dominated by this powerful caste, and to have been little more than a <span class="accented">maire du palais</span> (the same sense of the phrase is required in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>, and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:19-27 The prophet was to lay before the rulers and the people of Judah, the command to keep holy the sabbath day. Let them strictly observe the fourth command. If they obeyed this word, their prosperity should be restored. It is a day of rest, and must not be made a day of labour, unless in cases of necessity. Take heed, watch against the profanation of the sabbath. Let not the soul be burdened with the cares of this world on sabbath days. The streams of religion run deep or shallow, according as the banks of the sabbath are kept up or neglected. The degree of strictness with which this ordinance is observed, or the neglect shown towards it, is a good test to find the state of spiritual religion in any land. Let all; by their own example, by attention to their families, strive to check this evil, that national prosperity may be preserved, and, above all, that souls may be saved.</body></html>
