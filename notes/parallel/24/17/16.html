but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14-15</a>); and, though we cannot get beyond conjecture, it is quite possible that Jeremiah, in his youth, before the call of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-4.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 1:4</a>, may have been employed in the pasture grounds that belonged to Anathoth as a city of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-4.htm" title="And the suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.">Numbers 35:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-4.htm" title="And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.">Joshua 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-18.htm" title="Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-60.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs. All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities.">1Chronicles 6:60</a>). It is to some extent in favour of this view, that throughout the book the work of the shepherd, when used figuratively, answers to the work of the ruler, and not to that of the prophet. What he means, if we keep the version given above, is that he had not been too slack in his obedience, but neither had he been over eager. He had no desire to see the woful day that would fulfil his predictions. What had come from his lips was just what he had been bidden to say and no more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16-19</a>), and thus he had spoken as in the sight of God. The interpolated word "right" mars rather than mends the meaning,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have not eagerly withdrawn from following thee as a shepherd (or prophet). The prophet does not follow his own vague inclinations; he is but an under-shepherd, and waits on the will of his superior. He is, as Hosea calls him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>, Hebrew), "the man of the Spirit." If God leads any one, whether people or individuals, it is through the agency of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11, 12</a>); and it is the characteristic of the typical prophet that his ear is "wakened morning by morning" to receive his daily lesson. Only by thus "following" the Divine Leader, can a prophet act as pastor to his people. [The construction is, however, rather simplified by the rendering - a perfectly legitimate one... <span class="accented">from following thee as a companion</span>.] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The woeful day</span>. The word for "woeful" is the same rendered "desperately wicked" (ver. 9); the "day" of Judah's calamity is metaphorically "sick," like the heart of man. <span class="accented">So</span>, other words being used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-11.htm">Isaiah 17:11</a> (end). <span class="cmt_word">Was right before thee</span>; rather (since some adjective must be supplied), <span class="accented">was manifest before thee</span>. He appeals to the all-seeing Eye as a witness to his fidelity to his mission. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:12-18 The prophet acknowledges the favour of God in setting up religion. There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name. His hands can bind up the troubled conscience, and heal the broken heart; he can cure the worst diseases of our nature.</body></html>
