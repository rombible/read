that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard, and with your olive grove.">Exodus 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm" title="And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends ought to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>). The land would have its rest now, would "enjoy its Sabbaths" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.">Leviticus 26:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2Chronicles 36:21</a>), though Judah had failed in obedience to the Law which prescribed them. For the rest of the verse, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-14.htm" title="And I will make you to pass with your enemies into a land which you know not: for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.">Jeremiah 15:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-14.htm">Jeremiah 15:14</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Even thyself</span>; literally, <span class="accented">even with thyself</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with thy bare life (if the text, which is here evidently rather out of order, is correct). <span class="cmt_word">Shalt discontinue</span>. The word involves an allusion to the Law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a> and (especially) <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm">Deuteronomy 15:2</a> (see the Hebrew). The latter passage suggests a correction of the difficult "even with thyself," just preceding, into "thy hand." Thus we get for the opening of this verse, "And thou shalt let loose thy hand" (i.e. as Authorized Version, "shalt discontinue"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-4 The sins which men commit make little impression on their minds, yet every sin is marked in the book of God; they are all so graven upon the table of the heart, that they will all be remembered by the conscience. That which is graven in the heart will become plain in the life; men's actions show the desires and purposes of their hearts. What need we have to humble ourselves before God, who are so vile in his sight! How should we depend on his mercy and grace, begging of God to search and prove us; not to suffer us to be deceived by our own hearts, but to create in us a clean and holy nature by his Spirit!</body></html>
