and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Micah 4:2</a>, a poetic phrase for Jerusalem or Zion, its greatness consisting not in its material elevation above the "field" or surrounding country, but in being "my mountain," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the mountain of Jehovah. The words predict the plunder of the city, perhaps specially the plunder of the Temple.<p><span class= "bld">Thy high places.</span>--As having been from the time of Samuel onward the chief scene of the false worship of the people. The threat is repeated almost verbally from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm" title="Your substance and your treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.">Jeremiah 15:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my mountain in the field</span>; a still more obscure passage. The question is whether "my mountain in the field" is a vocative or an accusative dependent on "I will give." If the former, then the phrase will mean Jerusalem (comp. "rock of the plain," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>). This, however, does not suit with the second half of the verse ("thy high places," etch), and still less with ver. 4, which evidently refers to the people of Judah. Added to this, if Jerusalem were here addressed we should certainly expect feminine suffixes. It remains to take "my mountain," etc., as an accusative. It describes, not Jerusalem, but Mount Zion as the site of the temple, the mountain of the house of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>). Render, therefore, my <span class="accented">mountain in the field will I give</span>. The prophet magnifies Zion into a mountain with a widely extended prospect (comp. ver. 12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy substance and all thy treasures</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> these of the people. The part of the verse which begins here is almost the same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a> (see note). <span class="cmt_word">And thy high places for sin</span>. Keil explains, Jehovah declares that he will, on account of the sinful practices upon them, deliver up the high places throughout the land. Gesenius, "He will deliver up the high places <span class="accented">with</span> the sin attaching to them;" Hitzig, "as a sin offering." There is a question, however, whether there is not a corruption in the text, and whether we should not read, with Ewald, "without price for thy sins" (as in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-4 The sins which men commit make little impression on their minds, yet every sin is marked in the book of God; they are all so graven upon the table of the heart, that they will all be remembered by the conscience. That which is graven in the heart will become plain in the life; men's actions show the desires and purposes of their hearts. What need we have to humble ourselves before God, who are so vile in his sight! How should we depend on his mercy and grace, begging of God to search and prove us; not to suffer us to be deceived by our own hearts, but to create in us a clean and holy nature by his Spirit!</body></html>
