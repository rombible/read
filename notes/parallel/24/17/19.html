In its circumstances and mode of delivery it is parallel with the discourse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/22-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,">Jeremiah 22:1-5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The gate</span> <span class= "bld">of the children of the people . . .</span><span class= "ital">--</span>No gate so described is mentioned in the great topographical record of Nehemiah 3 or elsewhere, and we are therefore left to conjecture where it was. The context shows that it was a place of concourse, a gate of the Temple rather than of the city, perhaps the special gate by which the kings and people of Judah entered into the enclosure of the Temple. The name may indicate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-23.htm" title="And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.">Jeremiah 26:23</a>, that it was that "of the common people," or "laity," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-5.htm" title="And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brothers the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.">2Chronicles 35:5</a>, as dis tinguished from that used by the priests and Levites; and it would appear, from the nature of the warning proclaimed there, to have been the scene of some open desecration of the Sabbath--possibly of the sale of sheep or doves for sacrifice, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-14.htm" title="And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:">John 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>, or of the more common articles of the market, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm" title="In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.">Nehemiah 13:15</a>. By some writers it has been identified with the "gate of Benjamin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm" title="Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), but this would seem to have been more conspicuous as a place of judgment than of trade; nor is there any reason why it should be described by a different name here. Some, indeed. have conjectured that we should read "gate of <span class= "ital">Benjamin </span>"instead of "gate of <span class= "ital">Beni-am," </span>which gives the meaning "children of the people." It is noticeable that the message was to be delivered at the other gates as well, as being a protest against a prevalent sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-27.</span> - An exhortation to a more strict observance of the Sabbath. The reward held out is Jerusalem's continuance in all its old pomp, both temporal and spiritual, and the penalty the destruction of the city by fire. This passage stands in absolutely no connection with the preceding and the following prophecies; and we have just the same sense of suspicion in meeting with it here, in the midst of perfectly general exhortations, as in reading the parallel exhortations to Sabbath-keeping in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a>. and 58, surrounded as they are by the moving and almost evangelical rhetoric of the second part of Isaiah. Geiger and Dr. Rowland Williams have hence been led to conjecture that this section (or part of it) was introduced into the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies to assist the reforming movement of Ezra and Nehemiah. Certainly the regard for the Sabbath, so conspicuous in the later Judaism, dates, so far as we can see, from the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13.htm">Nehemiah 13</a>.), though it is credible enough that the perception of the high importance of this holy day (comp. Heine's 'Prinecssin Sabbath') began to acquire greater distinctness as the other parts of the social and religions organization were seen to be fading away (comp. art. "Sabbath" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the gate of the children of the people</span>. It is uncertain which of the gates of Jerusalem is meant, and not perfectly clear what is the meaning of the title. Does it mean Israelites as opposed to foreigners, or laymen as distinguished from priests? <span class="cmt_word">Whereby the kings of Judah come in</span>. Jeremiah appears to use the phrase "kings of Judah" in a particular sense (see on ver. 20). He may, no doubt, simply mean to say that those who are from time to time sovereigns of Judah enter by this gate. But once grant that the prophet does sometimes use the phrase in a sense of his own, and that in the very next verse, and it is very difficult to avoid interpreting it so in this passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:19-27 The prophet was to lay before the rulers and the people of Judah, the command to keep holy the sabbath day. Let them strictly observe the fourth command. If they obeyed this word, their prosperity should be restored. It is a day of rest, and must not be made a day of labour, unless in cases of necessity. Take heed, watch against the profanation of the sabbath. Let not the soul be burdened with the cares of this world on sabbath days. The streams of religion run deep or shallow, according as the banks of the sabbath are kept up or neglected. The degree of strictness with which this ordinance is observed, or the neglect shown towards it, is a good test to find the state of spiritual religion in any land. Let all; by their own example, by attention to their families, strive to check this evil, that national prosperity may be preserved, and, above all, that souls may be saved.</body></html>
