The thought expressed is that every locality that could be used for idolatrous worship made them "remember" that worship, and set about reproducing it. By some interpreters the clause is rendered, <span class= "ital">as they remember their children so do they their altars and their groves; i.e., </span>their idols are as dear to them as their offspring. The former construction is, however, the more natural, and is best supported by the versions.<p><span class= "bld">Groves.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as throughout the Old Testament, when connected with idolatry, the wooden columns that were the symbols of the Ph?nician goddess Asherah, possibly the same as Astarte (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm" title="But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm" title="For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.">1Kings 14:23</a>). The "green trees" suggested the thought of this worship--for the Asherah, though not a grove, was generally connected with one--as the "high hills" did that of the altars. Commonly the worship is described as "<span class= "ital">under </span>every green tree." Here a different preposition is used, "<span class= "ital">on </span>the green trees," connecting them with the verb "remember."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whilst their children remember</span>, etc. The connection of this with the preceding verse is rather obscure. Probably it is intended as an exemplification of the "sin of Judah," the inveterateness of which is shown by their thoughts spontaneously turning to the altars and symbols of the false gods whenever they are near a leafy tree or a high hill (probably "under the green trees" <span class="accented">is</span> the right reading; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; so Targum). To make "their sons" the accusative (with Hitzig and Keil), rendering, "As they remember their children, [even so they remember their altars]," seems unnatural; why should "children" and "altars" be associated in idea? <span class="cmt_word">Groves</span>; rather, <span class="accented">idols of Asherah</span>, the Canaanitish goddess. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-4 The sins which men commit make little impression on their minds, yet every sin is marked in the book of God; they are all so graven upon the table of the heart, that they will all be remembered by the conscience. That which is graven in the heart will become plain in the life; men's actions show the desires and purposes of their hearts. What need we have to humble ourselves before God, who are so vile in his sight! How should we depend on his mercy and grace, begging of God to search and prove us; not to suffer us to be deceived by our own hearts, but to create in us a clean and holy nature by his Spirit!</body></html>
