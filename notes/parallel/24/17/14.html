He needs "healing" and "salvation," but he knows where to seek for them, and is sure that his Lord will not leave the work incomplete. The prayer of the prophet is like that of the Psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm" title="Have mercy on me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm" title="O LORD my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.">Psalm 30:2</a>). In "thou art my praise" we have an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm" title="He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-6.htm" title="By you have I been held up from the womb: you are he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of you.">Psalm 71:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-18.</span> - A prayer of the prophet in this his hour of need. He who makes his boast of Jehovah may reckon upon his help. This is Jeremiah's principle. He prays for healing, <span class="cmt_word">Heal me... and I shall be</span> - rather, <span class="accented">that I may be</span> - <span class="cmt_word">healed</span>. He is one of those "broken in heart," whom Jehovah alone can "heal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:12-18 The prophet acknowledges the favour of God in setting up religion. There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name. His hands can bind up the troubled conscience, and heal the broken heart; he can cure the worst diseases of our nature.</body></html>
