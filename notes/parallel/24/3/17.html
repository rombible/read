<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-19.htm" title="The LORD has prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over all.">Psalm 103:19</a>), had probably been applied, in popular language, to the ark where the Lord "dwelt between the cherubim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm" title="So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.">1Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-15.htm" title="And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwell between the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.">2Kings 19:15</a>). The prophet extends it to the whole city, in that future of which he was doubtless thinking. To him, as to Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-2</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1-3</a>), there came a vision of the holy city as the centre of the divine Kingdom. It was not given to him to see what even the Apostles were slow to understand, that there is no holy city upon earth, and that his hopes would only be fulfilled in the heavenly Jerusalem which is the Church or family of God.<p><span class= "bld">The imagination.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">stubbornness, </span>as in the margin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Jerusalem's spiritual glory</span>. With Jeremiah's description, comp. that of Ezekiel," The name of the city from that day shall be, "The Lord is there" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>). This gives us the positive aspect of the Messianic period (comp. on ver. 16). Jerusalem shall be the spiritual center of the universe, because it is pervaded by the presence of the Most High (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). May we explain with Dr. Payne Smith, "Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Christian Church?" Only if the provisional character of the existing Church be kept well in view. <span class="cmt_word">All the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all except the chosen people. The word for "nations" (<span class="accented">goyim</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> that often rendered "heathen." <span class="cmt_word">To the name</span>; or, <span class="accented">because of the name</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. because Jehovah has revealed his name at Jerusalem. The phrase occurs again with a commentary in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a>, "Thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt." But we must not suppose that "name" is equivalent to "revelation;" rather, there is here an ellipsis - "because of the name" is equivalent to "because of the revelation of the <span class="accented">name</span>," or better still, "... of the <span class="accented">Name</span>." The "Name of Jehovah" <span class="accented">is</span> in fact a distinct hypostasis in the Divine Being; no mere personification of the Divine attributes (as the commentators are fond of saying), but (in the theological sense) a Person. The term, "Name of such and such a God,:' is common to Hebrew with Phoenician religion. In the famous inscription of Eshmunazar, King of Zidon, Ashtoreth is called "Name of Baal;" and to whichever proper name the religious term Name may be attached, it means a personal existence in the Divine nature, specially related to the world of humanity; or, to use the language of Hengstenberg, the bridge between the latter and the transcendent heights of God as he is in himself. In short, the Name of Jehovah is virtually identical with the Logos of St. John, or the second Person in the blessed Trinity. Hence the personal language now and again used of this Name in the Old Testament, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, "The Name of Jehovah <span class="accented">cometh</span> from far... <span class="accented">his lips</span> are full of indignation;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>," The desire of our soul was to thy Name;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>, "So shall they fear the Name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun." Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>; men do not run for safety to an abstract idea. Nor will all nations in the latter days resort either to a localized or to a spiritually diffused Jerusalem in the future, to gratify a refined intellectual curiosity. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they walk</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Israelites of the latter days; not the "nations" before mentioned (as Hengstenberg). The phrase occurs eight times in Jeremiah, and is always used of the Israelites. The word rendered "imagination" is peculiar (<span class="accented">sheri-ruth</span>). As Hengstenberg has pointed out, it occurs <span class="accented">independently</span> only in a single passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>); for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, it is plainly derived, not from the living language, from which it had disappeared, but from the written. (The close phraseological affinity between the Books of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah has been already indicated.) The rendering of the Authorized Version, which is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, is certainly wrong; the Vulgate has <span class="accented">pravitatum</span>; the etymological meaning is "stubbornness." The error of the versions may perhaps have arisen out of a faulty inference from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, where it stands in parallelism to "their counsels." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-20 See God's readiness to pardon sin, and the blessings reserved for gospel times. These words were proclaimed toward the north; to Israel, the ten tribes, captive in Assyria. They are directed how to return. If we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful and just to forgive them. These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringing back the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those that return to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest. The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole of that dispensation was to be done away, which took place after the multitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion of the Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them. A happy state of the church is foretold. He can teach all to call him Father; but without thorough change of heart and life, no man can be a child of God, and we have no security for not departing from Him.</body></html>
