Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-1.htm" title="Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:1-5</a>.

The prophecy is, of course, not inconsistent with passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, but as the national continuance of Israel was guaranteed, it was natural to refer to the subordinate civil authorities. <span class="cmt_word">According to mine heart</span>; better, <span class="accented">according to my mind</span>; for here, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>, it is something very far from perfection which is ascribed to the chosen rulers. "Heart" is sometimes equivalent to "understanding." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-20 See God's readiness to pardon sin, and the blessings reserved for gospel times. These words were proclaimed toward the north; to Israel, the ten tribes, captive in Assyria. They are directed how to return. If we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful and just to forgive them. These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringing back the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those that return to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest. The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole of that dispensation was to be done away, which took place after the multitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion of the Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them. A happy state of the church is foretold. He can teach all to call him Father; but without thorough change of heart and life, no man can be a child of God, and we have no security for not departing from Him.</body></html>
