Still keeping to the parable of the faithless wife, he bids Israel, as such, to look to the "high places" that have witnessed her adulteries with those other lords for whom she had forsaken Jehovah. Like the harlots of the east, she had sat by the wayside, as Tamar had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm" title="And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.">Genesis 38:14</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-12.htm" title="Now is she without, now in the streets, and lies in wait at every corner.)">Proverbs 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm" title="In that you build your eminent place in the head of every way, and make your high place in every street; and have not been as an harlot, in that you scorn hire;">Ezekiel 16:31</a>), not so much courted by her paramours as courting them.<p><span class= "bld">As the Arabian in the wilderness.</span>--The Arabian is chosen as the representative of the lawless predatory tribes of the desert.

How gently the Lord had corrected them! In receiving penitents, he is God, and not man. Whatever thou hast said or done hitherto, wilt thou not from this time apply to me? Will not this grace of God overcome thee? Now pardon is proclaimed, wilt thou not take the benefit? They will hope to find in him the tender compassions of a Father towards a returning prodigal. They will come to him as the Guide of their youth: youth needs a guide. Repenting sinners may encourage themselves that God will not keep his anger to the end. All God's mercies, in every age, suggest encouragement; and what can be so desirable for the young, as to have the Lord for their Father, and the Guide of their youth? Let parents daily direct their children earnestly to seek this blessing.</body></html>
