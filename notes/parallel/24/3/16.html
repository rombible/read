The ark, the very centre of the worship of Israel, the symbol and, it might seem, more than the symbol, of the Divine presence, that, too, should pass away, as the brasen serpent had become Nehushtan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>), and take its place as belonging only to the past. Foremost among the prophets was Jeremiah to perceive and proclaim that<p>"God fulfils Himself in many ways."<p>The legend of <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-4.htm" title="It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.">2 Maccabees 2:4-5</a>, that Jeremiah had hidden the tabernacle and the ark in a cave that they might be restored in the latter days, presents a singular contrast to the higher thoughts of the prophet.<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall it come to mind.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">come upon the heart, </span>which throughout the Old Testament implies the intellect rather than the affections.<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall they visit it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">shall they miss it, </span>as men miss what they value. The words probably refer to the feelings with which the ark had been restored to its place by Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-3.htm" title="And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden on your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,">2Chronicles 35:3</a>) after its displacement by Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-7.htm" title="And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:">2Chronicles 33:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall that be done any more.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">neither shall it </span>[<span class= "ital">the ark</span>]<span class= "ital"> be made any more. </span>It shall be left to decay and perish, and none shall care to reconstruct it. The words had, of course, a fulfilment in the ritual of the second Temple, where there was no ark in the Holy of Holies, and that loss was probably what Jeremiah foresaw most clearly, and for which he sought to prepare his people, as the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>) did to prepare those of his time for the more entire destruction of the Temple and its worship. But even within this horizon the thought was bold in itself and pregnant with yet greater truths.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye be multiplied</span>; a common feature in pictures of the latter days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-11.htm">Ezekiel 36:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord.</span> A definition of the Messianic period on its negative side - the ark shall he no longer the center of religious worship. We must remember that the ark is represented in the Law as the throne of Jehovah, who was "enthroned upon the cherubim" on the lid of the ark. It is in virtue of this sacramental presence that the temple is called the "dwelling-places" of Jehovah (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-1.htm">Psalm 84:1</a>, where Authorized Version has wrongly "tabernacles"). Now, in the Messianic period the consciousness of Jehovah's presence was to be so widely spread, at any rate in the center of God's kingdom, the holy city, that the ark would no longer be thought of; it would be, if not destroyed (we know, as a matter of fact, that the ark was destroyed in some unrecorded way), yet at least become utterly unimportant. Jerusalem would then naturally succeed to the title "Jehovah's throne" (applied to the temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall it come to mind</span>. The same phrase is used of the old heaven and earth as compared with the new (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>). In the concluding clauses, "visit" should rather be "miss," and "that be done" should be "it [viz. the ark] be made." On the whole subject of the prophetic descriptions of the worship of the Messianic period - descriptions which often wear at any rate a superficial appearance of inconsistency, see the luminous remarks of Professor Riehm, 'Messianic Prophecy,' pp. 161-163. At the same time, we must be extremely cautious how far we admit that Old Testament prophecies of the latter days have received a complete fulfillment in the Christian Church, considering how far the latter is from the realizable ideal, and also the importance attached in the New Testament as well as in the Old to the continuance of Israel as a nation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-20 See God's readiness to pardon sin, and the blessings reserved for gospel times. These words were proclaimed toward the north; to Israel, the ten tribes, captive in Assyria. They are directed how to return. If we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful and just to forgive them. These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringing back the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those that return to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest. The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole of that dispensation was to be done away, which took place after the multitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion of the Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them. A happy state of the church is foretold. He can teach all to call him Father; but without thorough change of heart and life, no man can be a child of God, and we have no security for not departing from Him.</body></html>
