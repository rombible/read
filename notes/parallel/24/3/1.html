The direct reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm" title="Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>, which forbade the return to the past husband as an abomination, a law which the recent discovery of the Book of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/22-10.htm" title="And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.">2Kings 22:10-11</a>) had probably brought into prominence. But there is also an obvious allusion to the like imagery in Hosea. There the prophet had done, literally or in parable, what the law had forbidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-16.htm" title="And it shall be at that day, said the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.">Hosea 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-3.htm" title="And I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be for another man: so will I also be for you.">Hosea 3:3</a>), and so had held out the possibility of return and the hope of pardon. Jeremiah has to play a sterner part. and to make the apostate adulteress at least feel that she had sinned too deeply to have any claims to forgiveness. It might seem as if Jehovah could not now return to the love of His espousals, and make her what she once had been.<p><span class= "bld">Yet return again to me, saith the Lord.</span>--The words sound in the English like a gracious invitation, and--in spite of the authority of many interpreters who take it as an indignant exclamation, <span class= "ital">and return to me! </span>an invitation given in irony, and so equivalent to rejection, as though that return were out of the question--it must, I think, be so taken. The prophet has, as we have seen, the history of Hosea in his mind, where there had been such a call to return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm" title="And I will betroth you to me for ever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies.">Hosea 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-3.htm" title="And I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be for another man: so will I also be for you.">Hosea 3:3</a>), and actually refers to it and repeats it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm" title="And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you to me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.">Jeremiah 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm" title="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm" title="Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. It surely implies a want of insight into the character of Jeremiah to suppose that he ever came before men as proclaiming an irrevocable condemnation, excluding the possibility of repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They say</span>, etc.; as the margin of Authorized Version correctly states, the Hebrew simply has "saying." Various ingenious attempts have been made to explain this. Hitzig, for instance, followed by Dr. Payne Smith, thinks that "saying" may be an unusual equivalent for "that is to say," "for example," or the like; while the Vulgate and Rashi, followed by De Wette and Rosenm&uuml;ller, assume an ellipsis, and render, "It is commonly said," or "I might say." But far the most natural way is to suppose that "saying" is a fragment of the superscription of the prophecy, the remainder of which has been accidentally placed in ver. 6, and that we should read, "And the word of the Lord came unto me in the days of Josiah the king, saying." So J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Graf, Naegelsbach. <span class="cmt_word">If a man put away his wife</span>. The argument is founded on the law of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, which forbade an Israelite who had divorced his wife to take her again, if in the interval she had been married to another. The Jews had broken a still more sacred tie, not once only, but repeatedly; they worshipped "gods many and lords many;" so that they had no longer any claim on Jehovah in virtue of his "covenant" with his people. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he return</span>, etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Ought he to return?</span> The force of the term is potential (comp. Authorized Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>, "which thing ought not to be done"). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not</span> in the next clause is rather <span class="accented">would not</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Yet return again to me.</span> So Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, and the view may seem to be confirmed by the invitations in vers. 12, 14, 22. But as it is obviously inconsistent with the argument of the verse, and as the verb may equally well be the infinitive or the imperative, most recent commentators render, "And thinkest thou to return to me?" (literally, <span class="accented">and</span> returning to me! implying that the very idea is inconceivable). Probably Jeremiah was aware that many of the Jews were dissatisfied with the religious condition of the nation (comp. ver. 4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 In repentance, it is good to think upon the sins of which we have been guilty, and the places and companies where they have been committed. How gently the Lord had corrected them! In receiving penitents, he is God, and not man. Whatever thou hast said or done hitherto, wilt thou not from this time apply to me? Will not this grace of God overcome thee? Now pardon is proclaimed, wilt thou not take the benefit? They will hope to find in him the tender compassions of a Father towards a returning prodigal. They will come to him as the Guide of their youth: youth needs a guide. Repenting sinners may encourage themselves that God will not keep his anger to the end. All God's mercies, in every age, suggest encouragement; and what can be so desirable for the young, as to have the Lord for their Father, and the Guide of their youth? Let parents daily direct their children earnestly to seek this blessing.</body></html>
