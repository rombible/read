The implied answer was in the negative, "No, He will not keep His anger to the end." Yet, so far, facts were against that yearning hope. It will be noted that the word "anger" is not in the Hebrew. It is, however, rightly inserted, after the precedent of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-2.htm" title="God is jealous, and the LORD revenges; the LORD revenges, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves wrath for his enemies.">Nahum 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm" title="He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.">Psalm 103:9</a>. The words seem, indeed, almost a quotation from the latter, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/3-4.htm" title="Will you not from this time cry to me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?">Jeremiah 3:4-5</a> may probably be looked on as cited from the penitential litanies in which the people had joined, and which were too soon followed by a return to the old evils (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/2-1.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 2:1-13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, resolutely and obstinately. That pathetic appeal to the mercy and love of Jehovah was followed by no amendment, but by a return to evil. Here the first prophecy, as reproduced from memory, ends, and the next verse begins a separate discourse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will he reserve</span>? rather, <span class="accented">Will he retain</span>, etc.? It is a continuation of the supposed address of Judah. <span class="cmt_word">To the end</span>? rather, <span class="accented">everlastingly? <span class="cmt_word"></span>Behold, thou hast spoken</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">Behold</span>, <span class="accented">thou hast spoken it</span>, <span class="accented">but hast done these evil things</span>, <span class="accented">and hast prevailed</span> (i.e. <span class="accented">succeeded</span>). The substance of the two verses (4 and 5) is well given by Ewald: "Unhappily her power truly to return has been exhausted, as not long ago after fresh signs of the Divine displeasure she prayed in beautiful language to [Jehovah] for new favor and abatement of the old sufferings, [but] she immediately fell again into her sin, and carried it out with cool determination." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 In repentance, it is good to think upon the sins of which we have been guilty, and the places and companies where they have been committed. How gently the Lord had corrected them! In receiving penitents, he is God, and not man. Whatever thou hast said or done hitherto, wilt thou not from this time apply to me? Will not this grace of God overcome thee? Now pardon is proclaimed, wilt thou not take the benefit? They will hope to find in him the tender compassions of a Father towards a returning prodigal. They will come to him as the Guide of their youth: youth needs a guide. Repenting sinners may encourage themselves that God will not keep his anger to the end. All God's mercies, in every age, suggest encouragement; and what can be so desirable for the young, as to have the Lord for their Father, and the Guide of their youth? Let parents daily direct their children earnestly to seek this blessing.</body></html>
