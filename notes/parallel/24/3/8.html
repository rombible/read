The actual repudiation consisted, of course, in the bitter exile and loss of national life, which Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-1.htm" title="Say you to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.">Hosea 2:1-13</a>) had predicted under a like figure.

The preceding words seem to compel us either (with the Vulgate) to omit "and I saw" altogether, or (with Ewald) to read the first letter of the verb differently, and render "and she saw," taking up the statement of ver. 7 ("saw; yea, she saw," etc.). The latter view is favored by a phrase in ver. 10 (see note below). The same corruption of the text (which is palaeographically an easy one) occurs probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-13.htm">Ezekiel 23:13</a>.
