The latter had been looking on the former with contemptuous scorn. She is now taught--the same imagery being continued that had begun in the first discourse--that her guilt is by far the greater of the two.<p><span class= "bld">Backsliding Israel.</span>--The epithet strikes the keynote of all that follows, and is, as it were, the text of the sermon. The force of the Hebrew is stronger than that of the English, and implies actual "apostasy," being, indeed, a substantive rather than an adjective. Apostasy is, as it were, personified in Israel; she is the <span class= "ital">renegade </span>sister.<p><span class= "bld">She is gone up.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">she goes, i.e., </span>is going continually.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said also unto me</span>, etc. It has been suggested (see on ver. 1) that this introductory clause belongs rather to ver. 1. Some sort of introduction, however, seems called for; Ewald supposes a shorter form, such as "And the Lord said further unto me." The view is not improbable, for although there is evidently a break between ver. 5 and ver. 6, there are points of contact enough between vers. 1-5 and the following discourse to prove that they represent the same prophetic period (comp. ver. 10 with ver. 3, vers. 8, 9 with ver. 1, ver. 12 with ver. 5, ver. 19 with ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Backsliding Israel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">apostasy Israel</span>. Usually a change or modification of a name is a sign of honor; here, however, it marks the disgrace of the bearer. Israel is apostasy personified (comp. vers. 14, 22). She is gone up; rather, <span class="accented">her wont hath been to go up</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-11 If we mark the crimes of those who break off from a religious profession, and the consequences, we see abundant reason to shun evil ways. It is dreadful to be proved more criminal than those who have actually perished in their sins; yet it will be small comfort in everlasting punishment, for them to know that others were viler than they.</body></html>
