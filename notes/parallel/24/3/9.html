The word is, however, very variously interpreted, and the meaning of "voice," or "cry," in the sense in which the "cry" of Sodom and Gomorrah was great (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;">Genesis 18:20</a>), seems more satisfactory.

So apparently the ancient versions. The only sense, however, which the word <span class="accented">kol</span> ever has in Hebrew is not "lightness," but "sound," "voice," and perhaps "rumor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-16.htm">Genesis 45:16</a>). Hence it is more strictly accurate to render "through the cry." etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13</a>), or "through the fame," etc. (as Authorized Version, margin). But neither of these seems quite suitable to the context, and if, as King James's translators seem to have felt it necessary to do, we desert the faithful translation, and enter on the path of conjecture, why not emend <span class="accented">kol</span> into <span class="accented">klon</span> (there is no <span class="accented">vav</span>, and such fragments of true readings are not altogether uncommon in the Hebrew text), which at once yields a good meaning - "through the disgrace of her whoredom ?" Ewald thinks that <span class="accented">kol</span> may be taken in the sense of <span class="accented">k'lon</span>; but this is really more arbitrary than emending the text. <span class="cmt_word">With stones</span>, etc. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-11 If we mark the crimes of those who break off from a religious profession, and the consequences, we see abundant reason to shun evil ways.
