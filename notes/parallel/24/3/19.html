The speaker is, of course, Jehovah. The <span class= "ital">How shall I put thee! </span>is an exclamation rather than a question, the utterance of a promise as with an intensity of affirmation. Special stress is laid on the pronoun "I." The words have been rendered by some commentators, following the Targum, <span class= "ital">How shall I clothe thee with children?</span><p><span class= "bld">A pleasant land.</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">a land of desire, i.e., </span>desirable.<p><span class= "bld">A goodly heritage of the hosts of nations.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">a heritage of the beauty of beauties </span>(Hebrew for "chief beauty") <span class= "ital">of the nations. </span>The English version rests on the assumption that the word translated "beauties" is the same as that elsewhere rendered "Sabaoth," or "hosts," which it closely resembles.<p><span class= "bld">And I said.</span>--Not, as in the English, the answer to a question, but the continuance of the same thought. God will treat repentant Israel as His child: He will lead Israel to trust Him as a father. The days of apostasy ("turning away") will then be over. The original Hebrew seems, to judge from the LXX. version, to have had the plural "ye shall call," "<span class= "ital">ye </span>shall not turn away," the prophet passing from the collective unity to the individuals that composed it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The concluding words of the last verse have turned the current of the prophet's thoughts. "Unto your fathers." Yes; how bright the prospect when that ideal of Israel was framed in the Divine counsels! Condescending accommodation to human modes of thought; <span class="cmt_word">But I said</span> fails to represent the relation of this verse to the preceding. Render, <span class="accented">I indeed had said</span>, and continue, <span class="accented">How will I</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Put thee among the children.</span> This is a very common rendering, but of doubtful correctness. It assumes that, from the point of view adopted (under Divine guidance) in the prophecies of Jeremiah, the various heathen nations were in the relation of sons to Jehovah. This is most improbable; indeed, even <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> does not really favor the doctrine of the universal fatherhood of God in the fullest sense of the word. Moreover, the pronoun rendered "thee" is in the feminine, indicating that the prophet has still in his mind the picture of Israel as Jehovah's bride. It would surely be an absurd statement that Jehovah would put his bride among the children! Render, therefore, <span class="accented">How will I found thee with sons!</span> comparing, for the use of the Hebrew verb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>, and for that of the preposition, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>. It is, in fact, the familiar figure by which a family or a nation is likened to a building ("house of Abraham," "of Israel"). Jehovah's purpose had been to make Abraham's seed as the dust of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>). Instead of that, the restored exiles would be few, and weak in proportion, so that the Jewish Church of the early restoration period is represented as complaining, "We made not the land salvation, neither were inhabitants of the world produced" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>). A special Divine promise was needed to surmount this grave difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">A goodly... nations</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a heritage the most glorious among the nations</span>. So in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6, 15</a>) Palestine is described as "the glory of all lands." The want of irrigation, and the denudation of the land, have no doubt much diminished the natural beauty and fertility of Palestine; but wherever moderate care is bestowed on the soil, how well it rewards it! <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt call me... shalt not turn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou wilt call me</span>... <span class="accented">wilt not turn</span>. It is the continuation of Jehovah's ideal for Israel. In response to his loving gifts, Israel would surely recognize him as her Father, and devote to him all her energies in willing obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Father</span> is here used, not in the spiritual and individualizing sense of the New Testament, but in such a sense as a member of a primitive Israelitish family, in which the <span class="accented">pairia potestas</span> was fully carried out, could realize. The first instance of the individualizing use of the term is in Ecclus. 23:1-4. (For the Old Testament use, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-20 See God's readiness to pardon sin, and the blessings reserved for gospel times. These words were proclaimed toward the north; to Israel, the ten tribes, captive in Assyria. They are directed how to return. If we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful and just to forgive them. These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringing back the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those that return to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest. The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole of that dispensation was to be done away, which took place after the multitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion of the Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them. A happy state of the church is foretold. He can teach all to call him Father; but without thorough change of heart and life, no man can be a child of God, and we have no security for not departing from Him.</body></html>
