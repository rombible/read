The prophet cannot bear to dwell upon the backsliding of his people. He knows the elements of good which still survive, and by faith sees them developed, through the teaching of God's good providence, into a fruitful repentance. How graphic is the description! <span class="cmt_word">On the very high places</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">bare</span>, <span class="accented">treeless heights or downs</span>, as ver. 2) where a licentious idolatry used to be practiced, <span class="cmt_word">a sound is heard</span> (render so, not <span class="accented">was</span> heard) - the sound of the loud and audible weeping of an impulsive Eastern people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For they have</span>; this evidently gives the reason of the bitter lamentation; render, <span class="accented">because they have</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-25 Sin is turning aside to crooked ways. And forgetting the Lord our God is at the bottom of all sin. By sin we bring ourselves into trouble. The promise to those that return is, God will heal their backslidings, by his pardoning mercy, his quieting peace, and his renewing grace. They come devoting themselves to God. They come disclaiming all expectations of relief and succour from any but the Lord. Therefore they come depending upon him only. He is the Lord, and he only can save. It points out the great salvation from sin Jesus Christ wrought out for us. They come justifying God in their troubles, and judging themselves for their sins. True penitents learn to call sin shame, even the sin they have been most pleased with. True penitents learn to call sin death and ruin, and to charge upon it all they suffer. While men harden themselves in sin, contempt and misery are their portion: for he that covereth his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh them, shall find mercy.</body></html>
