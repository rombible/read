<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm" title="Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.">2Samuel 11:21</a>), Mephibosheth and Merib-baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame.

The words point accordingly to the prodigal waste of victims, possibly of human life also, in the worship of Baal and that of Molech, which in the prophet's mind was identified with it, and which had brought with it nothing but a lasting shame. This also forms part of the confession of the repentant people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm" title="For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.">Jeremiah 11:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For shame</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the</span> Shame (i.e. the Baal). The words <span class="accented">Bosheth</span> ("Shame") and <span class="accented">Baal</span> are frequently interchanged; so again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). So, too, Jerubbesheth stands for Jerubbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>); Ishbosheth for Eshbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath devoured the labor of our fathers</span>, etc.; a condensed way of saying that Baal-worship has brought the judgments' of God upon us,, our flocks, and herds, and all the other labor (or rather "wealth;' <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. fruit of labor) of our fathers, being destroyed as the punishment of our sins (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30-32</a>). Another view is that the "devouring" had to do with the sacrifices, but it is improbable that the sacrificial worship of Baal bad developed to such a portentous extent, and the former explanation is in itself more suitable to the context. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:21-25 Sin is turning aside to crooked ways. And forgetting the Lord our God is at the bottom of all sin. By sin we bring ourselves into trouble. The promise to those that return is, God will heal their backslidings, by his pardoning mercy, his quieting peace, and his renewing grace. They come devoting themselves to God. They come disclaiming all expectations of relief and succour from any but the Lord. Therefore they come depending upon him only. He is the Lord, and he only can save. It points out the great salvation from sin Jesus Christ wrought out for us. They come justifying God in their troubles, and judging themselves for their sins. True penitents learn to call sin shame, even the sin they have been most pleased with. True penitents learn to call sin death and ruin, and to charge upon it all they suffer. While men harden themselves in sin, contempt and misery are their portion: for he that covereth his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh them, shall find mercy.</body></html>
