The prophet is represented as attacked by kings, princes, priests, and people, as the cities of Judah are by the invading armies. But the issue is different. They fall: he will hold out. The iron pillar is that which, rising in the centre of an Eastern house or temple (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-25.htm" title="And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.">Judges 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-21.htm" title="And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.">1Kings 7:21</a>), supports the flat roof, and enables it to be used as a terrace or platform on which men may meet. The "brasen walls" probably refer to the practice of fastening plates of copper over the brick or stonework of a fortification.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brasen walls</span>. The plural is used instead of a collective term for the whole circle of fortifications. In the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>) the singular occurs; the same alternation of plural and singular as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>. The combination of figures strikingly expresses the invincibility of one whose strength is in his God. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Judah</span>. Why the plural? Most reply, Because Jeremiah would have to do with successive sovereigns. But this meaning would have been just as well conveyed by the singular: "the king of Judah," without any name being added - would moan the king who from time to time happened to be reigning. "Kings of Judah" in Jeremiah seems to have a special meaning, and to include all the members of the royal family, who formed a numerous and powerful class (see on Jeremiah 17:20). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.</body></html>
