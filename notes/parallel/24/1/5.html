Other prophets were sent to Israel and Judah, with occasional parentheses of prophecies that affected the Gentiles. The horizon of Jeremiah was to extend more widely. In part his work was to make them drink of the cup of the Lord's fury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15-17</a>); but in part also he was a witness to them of a brighter future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm" title="Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-39.htm" title="But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:39</a>). It is as though he had drunk in the Spirit of Isaiah, and thought of the true prophet as one who was to be a light of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p>In this way, seemingly abrupt, yet probably following on a long process of divine education, was the youthful Jeremiah taught that he was to act a part specially appointed for him in the drama of his nation's history. He could not see a chance in the guidance that had led him thus far. The call that now came to him so clearly was not the echo of his own thoughts. All his life from infancy had been as that of one consecrated to a special work. Could he stop there? Must he not, like St. Paul, think of the divine purpose as prior to the very germ of his existence? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm" title="But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,">Galatians 1:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knew thee;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. took notice of thee; virtually equivalent to selected thee (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>). Observe, the predestination of individuals is a familiar idea in the Old Testament (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>). It was also familiar to the Assyrians: King Assurba-nipal declares at the opening of his ' Annals ' that the gods "in the body of his mother have made (him) to rule Assyria." Familiar, too, to the great family of religious reformers. For, as Dean Milman has truly observed, "No Pelagian ever has or ever will work a religious revolution. He who is destined for such a work must have a full conviction that God is acting directly, immediately, consciously, and therefore with irresistible power, upon him and through him He who is not predestined, who does not declare, who does not believe himself predestined as the author of a great religions movement, he in whom God is not manifestly, sensibly, avowedly working out his pre-established designs, will never be saint or reformer" ('Latin Christianity,' 1:111, 112). <span class="cmt_word">Sanctified thee</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. set thee apart for holy uses. <span class="cmt_word">Ordained</span>; rather, <span class="accented">appointed</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the nations</span>. Jeremiah's prophecies, in fact, have reference not only to Israel, but to the peoples in relation to Israel (ver. 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46-49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50</a> and Jeremiah 51.?). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-10 Jeremiah's early call to the work and office of a prophet is stated. He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words. Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety of kingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.</body></html>
