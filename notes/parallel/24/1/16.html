And yet the invaders in their sentence are to be but the ministers of a higher judgment than their own. In the words <span class= "ital">"my </span>judgments" He recognises their work.<p><span class= "bld">Who have forsaken.</span>--The remainder of the verse gives, as it were, the formal enumeration of the crimes for which Judah was condemned: (1) Apostacy from the true God; (2) the transfer of adoration to other Gods, such as Baal, Ashtaroth, and the Queen of Heaven; sins against the First Commandment; (3) the worship of graven images; a sin against the Second. The sins were of long standing, but the words point specially to the proportions they had assumed in the reign of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/33-1.htm" title="Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:">2Chronicles 33:1-7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will utter my judgments</span>; or, I <span class="accented">will hold a court of justice upon them</span>; literally, I <span class="accented">will speak judgments with them</span>. The expression is peculiar to Jeremiah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>), and includes both the examination of the accused, and the judicial sentence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All their wickedness</span>, etc. Their "wickedness," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. their infidelity to Jehovah, showed itself in burning incense to "other gods," and bowing down to their images. "Burned incense" is, however, too narrow a sense. The root-meaning of the verb is to be fragrant, and the causative conjugations will strictly mean only "to make a sweet odor," whether by the offering of incense or by burnt offerings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>, where a causative conjugation is used in the same wide sense here postulated; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>, where the word usually rendered "incense" seems rather to mean "a sweet smoke"). The prophet says, "of other gods" (not "of false gods"), out of consideration for the ignorance of his hearers, to whom Baal and Moloch really were as gods; in fact, that expressive word (cf.) which Isaiah uses ten times to express the unreality of the other so-called gods, occurs only once, and then not in quite the same sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>) in Jeremiah. But the prophet's own strict monotheism is proved by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>a; Jeremiah 8:19b; Jeremiah 16:20. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.</body></html>
