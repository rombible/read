I am about to call. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdoms of the north</span>; alluding possibly to the varied origin of the population of Assyria and Babylonia. But more probably it is simply a suggestive phrase, for the wide extent of the hostile empire referred to (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall set every one his throne</span>, etc. The kings, or. the, generals, representing "all the families, etc., shall set up the high seat of power and judicial authority at the broad space within the gate of the city, which constituted the Oriental forum (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>). Thither the besieged would have to come to surrender themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>) and to hear their fate. A similar prediction is made with regard to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9, 10</a>). It is true the seat of authority is there said to be placed at the entrance of the palace, but this was in fact another place where justice was wont to be administered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-2.htm">Jeremiah 22:2, 3</a>). Jerome's view, adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Nagelsbach, that "to set one's seat" means "to besiege" is against usage, and does not accord with the opening words of ver. 16. There is, however, an element of truth in it. The judgment executed ministerially by the northern kings or generals began with the siege of Jerusalem and the other cities, and hence the words with which the prophet continues. <span class="cmt_word">And against all the walls</span>, etc. We should have expected something like "and shall set themselves in array against," etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a> b); see, however, last note. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.</body></html>
