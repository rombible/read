The editor of Jeremiah and of Amos deserts the usual phrase ("burden" or , "utterance," "vision," "the word of the LORD which came," etc.) in order to give fuller information concerning the origin of the prophetic writers (but see on ver. 2). On the name Jeremiah, and on the position occupied by Hilkiah, see Introduction. <span class="cmt_word">That were in Anathoth</span>. So Vulgate; Septuagint, however (followed by Payne Smith), makes the relative refer to Jeremiah (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff4;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). But in this case would not the phrase have been "Jeremiah the priest," etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>)? Anathoth was one of the priestly cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>); it lay on or near the great northern road (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>), and has been identified by Dr. Robinson (so also by Lieutenant Conder) with 'Anata, situated on a ridge, an hour and a quarter north-northeast from Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-10 Jeremiah's early call to the work and office of a prophet is stated. He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words. Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety of kingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.</body></html>
