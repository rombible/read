The vivid image of intense activity re-appears in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>), and has become proverbial in the speech of Christendom.<p><span class= "bld">Be not dismayed.</span>--The repeated calls to courage appear to indicate--like St. Paul's exhortations to Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm" title="I give you charge in the sight of God, who vivifies all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;">1Timothy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3</a>)--a constitutional timidity.

Even Ezekiel, among the remnant of exiles on the banks of Chebar, needed a like encouragement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Lest I confound thee.</span>--The Hebrew emphasises the command by repeating the same words: <span class= "ital">Be not dismayed, lest I dismay thee.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gird up thy loins</span>, as an Oriental does before making any kind of physical exertion, whether walking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>), running (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>), or fighting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be not dismayed</span>. A want of confidence on Jeremiah's part will issue in his utter discomfiture by his enemies. "Dismay" in Hebrew has a twofold reference, subjective ("dismay") and objective ("ruin," "discomfiture"). Both references can be illustrated from this verse. (Comp. the command and - ver. 18 - premise to Jeremiah with the command and promise to Ezekiel - 3:8, 9.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.</body></html>
