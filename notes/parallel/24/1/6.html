With Jeremiah it was probably more indefinite, and in the intense consciousness of his own weakness he would naturally use a word below the actual standard of his age; and there is accordingly nothing against assuming any age within the third hebdomad of life. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-19.htm" title="And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.">Genesis 34:19</a> it is used of a young man old enough for marriage. The words are memorable as striking a note common to the lives of many prophets; common, also, we may add, to most men as they feel themselves called to any great work. So Moses draws back: "I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>). So Isaiah cries, "Woe is me! for . . . I am a man of unclean lips" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>); and Peter, "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>). Something of the same shrinking is implied in St. Paul's command to Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1Timothy 4:12</a>). In tracing the whole course of Jeremiah's work, we must never forget the divine constraint by which he entered on them. A necessity was laid upon him, as afterwards on St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1Corinthians 9:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God</span>! rather, Alas, O <span class="accented">Lord Jehovah!</span> It is a cry of alarm and pain, and recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I am a child</span>. I am too young to support such an office. The word rendered "child" is used elsewhere of youths nearly grown up (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-10 Jeremiah's early call to the work and office of a prophet is stated. He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words. Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety of kingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.</body></html>
