He is at once set (literally, made the "deputy," or representative, of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-28.htm" title="And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?">Judges 9:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-11.htm" title="Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought to the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.">2Chronicles 24:11</a>, the "officer," or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-1.htm" title="Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.">Jeremiah 20:1</a>, "chief governor") over the nations, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as before, the nations external to Israel, and the "kingdoms" including it. The work at first seems one simply of destruction--to <span class= "ital">root out and ruin </span>(so we may represent the alliterative assonance of the Hebrew), <span class= "ital">to destroy and rend asunder. </span>But beyond that there is the hope of a work of construction. He is to "build up" the fallen ruins of Israel, to "plant" in the land that had been made desolate. The whole sequel of the book is a comment on these words. It passes through terror and darkness to the glory and the blessing of the New Covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set thee</span>; literally, I have <span class="accented">made thee an overseer</span>, <span class="accented">or vicegerent</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-34.htm">Genesis 41:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-28.htm">Judges 9:28</a>, where the Authorized Version renders the cognate noun "officer"). <span class="cmt_word">To root out... to plant</span>, viz. by pronouncing that Divine judgment which fulfils itself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). As there is so much more threatening than promise in Jeremiah's writings, the destructive side of his activity is expressed by four verbs, the constructive only by two. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-10 Jeremiah's early call to the work and office of a prophet is stated. He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words. Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety of kingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.</body></html>
