Previously to the battle of Carchemish, the Babylonians are only mentioned vaguely as a northern people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>). Strictly speaking, they were an eastern people from the point of view of Palestine; but the caravan-road which the Chaldaean armies had to take entered Palestine at Dan (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-15.htm">Jeremiah 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>), and then proceeded southward. (On the question whether a Scythian invasion is referred to, at least conjointly with the Babylonian, see Introduction.) <span class="cmt_word">An evil</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the evil</span>; viz. the calamity which in deepening gloom forms the burden of the prophet's discourses. <span class="cmt_word">Shall break forth</span>; literally, shall <span class="accented">open</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. let loose by opening (comp. the use of the same verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>, literally, "looseth not his prisoners homewards;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>, literally, "that we may open," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "bring forth wheat"). There is, however, some difficulty in explaining the choice of this expression. We might indeed suppose that the caldron had a lid, and that the removal or falling off of this lid is the "opening" referred to by the phrase. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.</body></html>
