for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.">Jeremiah 7:29</a>, but <span class= "ital">bamoth, </span>as in the "high places" of Baal, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.">Numbers 22:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to an high place.">Numbers 23:3</a>, the Bamoth-baal of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm" title="Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,">Joshua 13:17</a>. The word had become almost technical for the mounds, natural or (as in this passage) artificial, on which altars to Jehovah or <span class= "ital">to </span>other gods were erected, and appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-12.htm" title="And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:">1Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1Kings 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-29.htm" title="Then I said to them, What is the high place whereunto you go? And the name whereof is called Bamah to this day.">Ezekiel 20:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm" title="And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.">Amos 7:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Tophet.</span>--This appears to have been originally, not a local name, but a descriptive epithet. The word appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm" title="He has made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.">Job 17:6</a> ("by-word" in the Authorised version) as a thing spat upon and loathed. Its use is probably therefore analogous to the scorn with which the prophets substituted <span class= "ital">bosheth, </span>the "shameful thing," for Baal (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-24.htm" title="For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.">Jeremiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm" title="For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.">Jeremiah 11:13</a>). When the prediction is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm" title="And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.">Jeremiah 32:35</a>, we have the "high places of Baal," and "Tophet" here is obviously substituted for that name in indignant contempt. The word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm" title="For Tophet is ordained of old; yes, for the king it is prepared; he has made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, does kindle it.">Isaiah 30:33</a>, though not identical in form (<span class= "ital">Tophteh, </span>not <span class= "ital">Tophet</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>had probably the same meaning. Other etymologies give as the meaning of the word "a garden," "a place of burning," or "a place of drums," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a music grove, and so connect it more closely with the Molech ritual. Possibly the last was the original meaning of the name, for which, as said above, the prophets used the term of opprobrium.<p><span class= "bld">The son of Hinnom.</span>--Possibly the first recorded owner, or a local hero. The name is perpetuated in later Jewish language in Ge-henna = Ge-Hinnom = the vale of Hinnom. It was older than the Molech worship with which it became identified, and appears in the "Doomsday Book" of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To burn their sons and their daughters.</span>--The words are important as determining the character of the act more vaguely described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm" title="And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.">Jeremiah 32:35</a>, as "making to pass through the fire." The children were, in some cases at least, actually burnt, though often, perhaps (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm" title="That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?">Ezekiel 16:21</a>), slain first. Horrible as the practice seems to us, it was part of the Canaanite or Ph?nician worship of Molech or Malcom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2-5</a>), and had been practised by Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2Chronicles 28:3</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Kings 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm" title="And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Chronicles 33:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high places of Tophet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the high places of the</span> Topheth - (on the "high places" (Hebrew <span class="accented">bamoth</span>) <span class="accented">- hero</span> probably artificial mounds to erect the altars upon, and on "the Topheth," see Commentary on 1 Kings). <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of the son of Hinnom</span>. Hitzig and others would take Hinnom as a noun meaning "groaning" (Rashi, the great Jewish commentator. had already proposed this view), which is at first sight very plausible. But this name of the valley is already found in the description of the boundaries of Judah and Benin-rain in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To burn their sons</span>, etc. (On the worship of Moloch (Saturn), see on Leviticus 18:21, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20, 21</a>, from which it appears that the children were first slain before being "caused to pass through the fire.") <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:29-34 In token both of sorrow and of slavery, Jerusalem must be degraded, and separated from God, as she had been separated to him. The heart is the place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sin has the innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all mirth. How many ruin their health and property without complaining, when engaged in Satan's service! May we learn to relish holy joys, and to sit loose to all others though lawful.</body></html>
