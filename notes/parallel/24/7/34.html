Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.">Jeremiah 16:9</a>;

For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:11</a>). No words could paint the utter break-up of the life of the nation more forcibly. Nothing is heard but wailing and lamentation, or, more terrible even than that, there is the utter silence of solitude. The capacity for joy and the occasions for rejoicing (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-39.htm" title="Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold, there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums, and instruments of musick, and many weapons.">1 Maccabees 9:39</a> for the bridal rejoicings of Israel) belong alike to the past.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be desolate.</span>--The same word as in the "waste places" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm" title="For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.">Isaiah 51:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm" title="And they that shall be of you shall build the old waste places: you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.">Isaiah 58:12</a>; it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-4.htm" title="O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.">Ezekiel 13:4</a> for the haunts of the "foxes," or rather the "jackals" of the "deserts," but always of places that, having been once inhabited, have fallen into ruins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm" title="And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the smell of your sweet odors.">Leviticus 26:31</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land shall be desolate</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall become a waste</span>.

In both passages the word for "waste" is <span class="accented">khorbah</span>, which, as Dr. Payne Smith remarks, is "used only of places which, having once been inhabited, have then fallen into ruin."

The heart is the place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sin has the innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all mirth. How many ruin their health and property without complaining, when engaged in Satan's service! May we learn to relish holy joys, and to sit loose to all others though lawful.</body></html>
