Shiloh had been chosen for the centre of the worship of Israel after the conquest of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm" title="And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.">Joshua 18:1</a>), and was reverenced as such through the whole period of the Judges. It had not, however, been a centre of light and purity. It had been defiled by wild dances of a half-idolatrous character; by deeds of shameless violence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/21-19.htm" title="Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.">Judges 21:19-21</a>), and by the sins of the sons of Eli (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm" title="Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Samuel 2:22</a>). And so the judgment came. It lost the presence of the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-17.htm" title="And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.">1Samuel 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-58.htm" title="For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.">Psalm 78:58-64</a>); its people were slaughtered by the Philistines; it fell into decay. It is possible, as the words "temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm" title="So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat on a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.">1Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;">1Samuel 3:3</a>) and "house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm" title="And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.">1Samuel 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm" title="And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.">Judges 18:31</a>) applied to it suggest, that substantial buildings may have gathered round the original tabernacle, and that those wasted ruins may have given a special force to Jeremiah's allusion. It will be seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm" title="Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.">Jeremiah 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-9.htm" title="Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-11.htm" title="Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.">Jeremiah 26:11</a>, that it was this reference that more than anything else provoked the wrath of priest and people. They thought with a half-concealed exultation of the fate of the earlier sanctuary in Ephraim, which had given way to that of Judah. They forgot that like sins bring about like punishments, and were startled when they heard that as terrible a doom was impending over the Temple of which they boasted. It would appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm" title="That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 41:5</a> that the ruin was not total, perhaps that it was still visited by pilgrims. Jerome describes it as a heap of ruins. It has been identified by modern travellers with the village of <span class= "ital">Seilun.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh</span>. Jeremiah attacks this false confidence in the temple of Jerusalem, by pointing to the destruction of an earlier sanctuary, of which very little is known, indeed only so much as to give an edge to our desire for more. It is certain, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, that the tabernacle and the ark found a resting-place at Shiloh (an Ephraimitish town to the north of Bethel), nearly the whole of the period of the judges, or more exactly between the latter days of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) and the death of Eli (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>). Manifestly, then, there must have been some sort of "house," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. temple, at Shiloh; a mere tent would not have been sufficient for so long a period. This presumption is confirmed by the language of Jeremiah, and by the expressions of the narrative books. The fate which the prophet is bidden to announce for the existing temple is analogous to that which fell upon "Jehovah's place in Shiloh." The latter was, therefore, not merely a deportation of the ark, such as is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>. And when the narrator of the times of Samuel speaks of Eli as "sitting by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>), is it more natural to suppose t the word "temple" is here applied to the tabernacle, or that there was really a house, however rude, as sacred in the eyes of the faithful as was afterwards the splendid temple at Jerusalem? The latter view is strongly confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, "All the time that the house of God in Shiloh existed" (Authorized Version is misleading), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>, where the Levite travelling to Mount Ephraim says, "I am going to the house of Jehovah." It is no doubt strange at first sight that so little information is given us as to this central sanctuary of the true religion; but are there not other omissions (especially in the history of the judges), which are equally strange as long as we look upon the Old Testament as primarily an historical document? We do know something, however, and more than is generally suspected; for when the right translation is restored in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, it follows, from a comparison of this and the preceding verse, that the temple of Shiloh was destroyed simultaneously with the captivity of the northern tribes. The impression produced by this emphatic announcement of Jeremiah is revealed to us by a later passage in his book (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.</body></html>
