The prophet was not tied to the actual letter of his statement, and the prominence given to Samuel, as the first who bore the name of prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm" title="(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)">1Samuel 9:9</a>), seems at first against him. On the other hand, the gift of prophecy (as seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25-29</a>) was bestowed freely even during the wilderness wanderings, and the mention of prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-8.htm" title="That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, which said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;">Judges 6:8</a>) and men of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm" title="Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:">Judges 13:6</a>), perhaps, also, that of the "angel" or messenger of God, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-23.htm" title="Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.">Judges 5:23</a>, as well as the honour paid to seers before the time of Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm" title="And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.">1Samuel 9:8</a>), show that, great as he was, it was that name and the organisation, rather than the gift, that were new in his ministry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:21-28 God shows that obedience was required of them. That which God commanded was, Hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God. The promise is very encouraging. Let God's will be your rule, and his favour shall be your happiness. God was displeased with disobedience. We understand the gospel as little as the Jews understood the law, if we think that even the sacrifice of Christ lessens our obligation to obey.</body></html>
