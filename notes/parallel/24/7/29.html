</span>but the verb determines the meaning. The word <span class= "ital">Netzer </span>("consecration" in the Authorised version) is applied to the unshorn locks of the Nazarite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm" title="He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is on his head.">Numbers 6:7</a>), and from it he took his name. As the Nazarite was to shave his head if he came in contact with a corpse, as cutting the hair close was generally among Semitic races the sign of extremest sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm" title="Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm" title="Make you bald, and poll you for your delicate children; enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you.">Micah 1:16</a>), so Jerusalem was to sit as a woman rejected by her husband, bereaved of her children. (Comp. the picture in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/lamentations/1-1.htm" title="How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!">Lamentations 1:1-3</a>.) The word is applied also to the "crown" of the high priest in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm" title="And you shall put the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban.">Exodus 29:6</a>, the "crown" of the anointing oil in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-12.htm" title="Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 21:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">O Jerusalem.</span>--The italics show that the words are not in the Hebrew, but the insertion of some such words was rendered necessary by the fact that the verb "cut off" is in the feminine. Those who heard or read the words of the prophet, who so often spoke of "the daughter of Zion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-2.htm" title="I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.">Jeremiah 6:2</a>), of "the daughter of his people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm" title="They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-11.htm" title="For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.">Jeremiah 8:11</a>), of "the betrothed of Jehovah" (Jeremiah 2, 3), would be at no loss to understand his meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-34.</span> - Tophet, the greatest of all abominations; the beginning of the Divine retribution. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut off thine hair</span>. The "daughter of Zion," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the community of Jerusalem, is addressed; this appears from the verb being in the feminine. It is a choice expression which the prophet employs - literally, <span class="accented">shear off thy crown</span> (i.e. thy chief ornament). The act was to be a sign of mourning (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>). Some think there is also a reference to the vow of the Nazarite (the word for "crown" being here <span class="accented">nezer</span>, which is also the word rendered in Authorized Version, "separation," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "consecration," in the law of the Nazarite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>.).

The heart is the place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sin has the innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all mirth. How many ruin their health and property without complaining, when engaged in Satan's service! May we learn to relish holy joys, and to sit loose to all others though lawful.</body></html>
