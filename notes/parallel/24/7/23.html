The influence of Jeremiah's teaching on later Jewish thought is shown by the fact that this very section of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/7-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.">Jeremiah 7:21-28</a>) appears in the Synagogue ritual as the <span class= "ital">Haphtara, </span>or second lesson from the prophets, after Leviticus 6-8, as the <span class= "ital">Parashah, </span>or first lesson from the Law. The Synagogue worship, indeed, was, in the nature of the case, the result of the teaching of scribes and prophets rather than of priests, and therefore a witness for the spiritual truth symbolised in sacrifice, and not for the perpetuation of the symbol.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this thing...

That which God commanded was, Hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God. The promise is very encouraging. Let God's will be your rule, and his favour shall be your happiness. God was displeased with disobedience. We understand the gospel as little as the Jews understood the law, if we think that even the sacrifice of Christ lessens our obligation to obey.</body></html>
