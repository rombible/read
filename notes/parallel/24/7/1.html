There is nothing in the discourse which absolutely fixes its date, but the description of idolatry, as prevalent, and, possibly, the reference to the presence of the Chaldaean invader in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm" title="The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm" title="Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.">Jeremiah 10:22</a>, fit in rather with the reign of Jehoiakim than with that of Josiah; and from the special reference to Shiloh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm" title="Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.">Jeremiah 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-9.htm" title="Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 26:9</a>, as occurring in a prophecy delivered at the beginning of that reign, it was probably this discourse, or one like it, and delivered about the same time, that drew down that king's displeasure (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.">Jeremiah 7:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - The Divine requirements and the corresponding promise. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.</body></html>
