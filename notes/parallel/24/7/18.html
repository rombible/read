Its ritual probably resembled that of the Babylonian Aphrodite, Mylitta, the mother-goddess, in its impurities (Herod. i. 199; Bar 6:43), and thus provoked the burning indignation of the prophet here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm" title="And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our men?">Jeremiah 44:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-25.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: you will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.">Jeremiah 44:25</a>. The word rendered "cakes," and found only in connection with this worship, was clearly a technical term, and probably of foreign origin. Cakes of a like kind, made of flour and honey, round like the full moon, and known, therefore, as <span class= "ital">selence </span>or "moons," were offered, like the <span class= "ital">Minchah </span>or meat-offerings in the Mosaic ritual, the <span class= "ital">Neideh </span>in the Egyptian worship of the goddess <span class= "ital">Neith, </span>at Athens to Artemis, and in Sicily to Hecate (Theocr., <span class= "ital">Idylls, </span>ii. 33). The worship of Ashtoreth (Milton speaks of her as "Astarte, Queen of Heaven, with crescent horn "), though of kindred nature, was not identical with that of the Queen of Heaven, that name signifying a star, and being identified with the planet Venus. A various reading gives, as in the margin, "the frame of heaven."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children... the fathers... the women</span>. All ages were represented in this idolatrous act, thus justifying the sweeping character of the judgment as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Cakes</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>). The word is peculiar (<span class="accented">kavvanim</span>), and perhaps entered Palestine together with the foreign rite to which the cakes belonged. Various conjectures have been offered as to their nature, but without any demonstrable ground. Sacrificial cakes were not uncommon. Hosea refers to the luscious raisin-cakes used by idolaters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the queen of heaven.</span> This title of a divinity only occurs in Jeremiah (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-19, 25</a>). It reminds us, first, of titles (such as "queen of the gods") of the Babylonic-Assyrian goddesses, Bilat (Beltis) and Istar, who, though divided in later times, were "originally but two forms of the same goddess" (Sayce, <span class="accented">Transactions of Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 3:169). It is, however, perhaps an <span class="accented">objection</span> to the view that Bilat or Istar is intended, that neither here nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44.htm">Jeremiah 44</a>. is there any allusion to that characteristic lascivious custom which was connected in Babylonia with the worship of Istar (Herod., 1:199). The phrase has, however, another association. It reminds us, in the second place, of the Egyptian goddess Neith, "the mother of the gods." The first mention of "the queen of heaven" in Jeremiah occurs in the reign of Jehoiakim, who was placed on the throne by Pharaoh-Necho, one of the Saite dynasty (Says was the seat of the worship of Neith). If the "queen of heaven" were a Babylonic-Assyrian goddess, we should have looked for the introduction of her cultus at an earlier period (e.g. under Ahaz). But it was in accordance with the principles of polytheism (and the mass of the Jews had an irresistible tendency to polytheism), to adopt the patron-deity of the suzerain. Subsequently Judah became the subject of Nebuchadnezzar; thus it was equally natural to give up the worship of an Egyptian deity. Jewish colonists in Migdol would as naturally revert to the cultus of the Egyptian "mother of the gods" (see Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' Breslau, 1874, pp. 349-351). The form of the word rendered "queen" being very uncommon, another reading, pronounced in the same way, obtained currency. This should be rendered, not "frame," or "workmanship" (as Authorized Version, margin), but "service." The context, however, evidently requires a person. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-20 The Jews took pride in showing zeal for their idols. Let us learn to be earnest in the service of our God, even from this bad example. Let us think it an honour to be employed in any work for God. Let us be as diligent ourselves, and as careful to teach our children the truths of God, as many are to teach the mysteries of iniquity. The direct tendency of this sin is malice against God, but it will hurt themselves. And they shall find there is no escaping. God's wrath is fire unquenchable.</body></html>
