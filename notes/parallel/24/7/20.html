Inferentially, this doctrine appears from the narrative of the Fall, and still more clearly from Isaiah's description of Paradise regained (11.). Hosea speaks of sufferings of the animals arising out of the guilt of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>), and a consciousness of the "solidarity" of all living creatures is ascribed to a Ninevite king in the Book of Jonah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7, 8</a>). In general, the origin of this community of suffering is left mysterious, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a> it is expressly stated as the cause of the Deluge, that "all flesh [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. both man and beast.] had corrupted its way upon the earth;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. apparently, that contact with man had led to a corruption of the original innocence of the lower animals. It is a common experience that intercourse between Christianized (not to say civilized) man and the domestic animals produces a sometimes pathetic change in the psychic phenomena of the latter. Is the reverse process utterly inconceivable? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-20 The Jews took pride in showing zeal for their idols. Let us learn to be earnest in the service of our God, even from this bad example. Let us think it an honour to be employed in any work for God. Let us be as diligent ourselves, and as careful to teach our children the truths of God, as many are to teach the mysteries of iniquity. The direct tendency of this sin is malice against God, but it will hurt themselves. And they shall find there is no escaping. God's wrath is fire unquenchable.</body></html>
