With no thought of the Divine Presence of which it was the symbol, they were ever harping on its greatness, identifying themselves and the people with that greatness, and predicting its perpetuity. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-1.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.">Matthew 24:1</a> the disciples of our Lord point, as with a national pride, to the buildings of the later Temple. The plural "these" is used rather than the singular, as representing the whole complete fabric of courts and porticoes. The higher truth that the "congregation" of Israel was the living Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>), was not likely to be in the thoughts of those whom Jeremiah rebuked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The temple of the Lord</span>. Notice the iteration of the phrase, as if its very sound were a charm against evil. It reminds us of the performances of the howling dervishes at Cairo, who "sometimes remain for hours, incessantly shouting the Muslim confession of faith (<span class="accented">la ilaha</span>, etc.)" (Dr. Ebers, in Badeker's 'Egypt,' p. 150). The phrase is repeated three times to express earnestness of the speakers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>, "O earth, earth, earth"). These false prophets evidently retained a large amount of the old materialistic faith of the Semitic nations (to whom the Israelites belonged by race), which localized the presence and the power of the divinity. The temple was, in fact, their palladium, and as long as it stood, the national independence appeared to them to be secured. They faithfully handed on the teaching of those prophets of the last generation, who, as Micah tells us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), were wont to "lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us." How Isaiah met this error we may collect from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a> (see my Commentary). <span class="cmt_word">Are these</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. these buildings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>, where for "the places" the Hebrew has "these"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.</body></html>
