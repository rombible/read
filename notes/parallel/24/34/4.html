His going to Babylon would not necessarily shut him out from a life of comparative ease and an honourable burial. Jeconiah, it is true, had been thrown into prison (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-31.htm" title="One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,">Jeremiah 51:31</a>), and remained there during the whole reign of Nebuchadnezzar, but that was the result of his obstinate resistance, and Zedekiah might avert that doom by a timely submission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet hear the word of the Lord,</span> etc. Clearly this introduces a limitation of the foregoing threat. Zedekiah will, it is true, be carried to Babylon, but he will not suffer a violent death; he will "die in peace," and be buried with all customary royal honours. A difficulty, however, has been felt in admitting this view. How could Zedekiah be said to die in peace, when he was "in prison till the day of his death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>)? and how could the deposed king of a captive people be honoured with a public mourning? The reply is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, as compared with a cruel death by flaying or impalement, it was "peace" to live in the obscure quiet of a prison; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, as the Jews appear to have been left very much to themselves (see Ezekiel, <span class="accented">passim</span>), it is credible enough that they were allowed to show the customary honours to a deceased representative of David. At any rate, the alternative view seems not in accordance with sound exegesis, viz. that the verse means this, "If thou obey the word of the Lord, and surrender thyself to Nebuchadnezzar, thou shalt live and die in peaceable possession of the throne." What parallel can be produced for this violent interpretation? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-7 Zedekiah is told that the city shall be taken, and that he shall die a captive, but he shall die a natural death. It is better to live and die penitent in a prison, than to live and die impenitent in a palace.</body></html>
