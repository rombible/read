So, when Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, the victims that had been slain were cut up and arranged opposite each other, and when the "burning lamp" passed between the pieces it was the token that Jehovah had completed the covenant, even as men complete it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/15-10.htm" title="And he took to him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.">Genesis 15:10-17</a>). The implied thought thus symbolised was that the parties to the contract prayed, as in the analogous case of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-7.htm" title="And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.">1Samuel 11:7</a>, that they might be torn limb from limb like the victims if they broke the covenant, The antiquity and wide extent of the symbolism is shown by its appearing in the ritual of Greece, as in the phrase <span class= "greekheb">????? ??????</span> --to ratify (literally, to <span class= "ital">cut</span>) oaths, in Homer (<span class= "ital">Iliad, ii.</span> 124, <span class= "ital">Od. </span>xxiv. 483, and elsewhere), and the Latin <span class= "ital">f?dus ferire. </span>In Livy (i. 24) we have both the phrase, the act which it implied, and the prayer which accompanied it, that if the Roman people proved unfaithful to their covenant Jupiter would slay them as the priest slew the victim. "<span class= "ital">Tu illo die, Jupiter, populum Romanum sic ferito, ut ego hunc porcum hic hodie feriam, tantoque magis ferito, quanto magis potes pollesque." </span>("Do thou, Jupiter, on that day so smite the Roman people [if they break the covenant] as I this day smite this swine--yea, so much the more smite them as thou art mightier and more prevailing.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they out the calf in twain,</span> etc. This clause should be translated differently, and placed, for clearness, in a parenthesis (<span class="accented">the calf which they cut in twain, and between the parts of which they passed</span>). The division of the calf might, in fact, be called in Hebrew either "the covenant" or "the token of the covenant" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10, 11</a>). It was a solemn assurance that he who should transgress God's Law should share the same fate as the victim. The same idea seems to have dictated the Hebrew phrase, "to <span class="accented">cut</span> a covenant," and the Greek and Latin equivalents (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">foedus icere</span>); comp. the parallel narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:8-22 A Jew should not be held in servitude above seven years. This law they and their fathers had broken. And when there was some hope that the siege was raised, they forced the servants they had released into their services again. Those who think to cheat God by dissembled repentance and partial reformation, put the greatest cheat upon their own souls. This shows that liberty to sin, is really only liberty to have the sorest judgments. It is just with God to disappoint expectations of mercy, when we disappoint the expectations of duty. And when reformation springs only from terror, it is seldom lasting. Solemn vows thus entered into, profane the ordinances of God; and the most forward to bind themselves by appeals to God, are commonly most ready to break them. Let us look to our hearts, that our repentance may be real, and take care that the law of God regulates our conduct.</body></html>
