Lachish was one of the strongest towns of the Amorites in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm" title="Why Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,">Joshua 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-5.htm" title="Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.">Joshua 10:5</a>), and was situated in the <span class= "ital">Shephelah, </span>or lowland district (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-39.htm" title="Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,">Joshua 15:39</a>).

Amaziah took refuge there on his flight from the conspiracy at Jerusalem (2 Chron. 14:19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm" title="Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.">2Chronicles 25:27</a>). It was taken by Sennacherib on his way from Assyria to Egypt, and made the monarch's headquarters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-9.htm" title="After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,">2Chronicles 32:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm" title="And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.

A slab at Kouyunjik (Layard's <span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon, </span>149-152; <span class= "ital">Monuments of Nineveh, </span>2nd Series, Plates xxi, 24) represents the siege of <span class= "ital">Lakhisha </span>by the armies of Sennacherib, and gives something like a ground-plan of the city. Its site has not been identified with certainty, but ruins still known as <span class= "ital">Um-lakis </span>are found between Gaza and Eleutheropolis. It is mentioned here as being, next to Jerusalem, one of the strongest fortresses of the kingdom of Judah, which as yet had resisted the attack of Nebuchadnezzar's armies. Azekah, less conspicuous in history, was also in the <span class= "ital">Shephelah </span>region, and is named with other cities in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/10-10.htm" title="And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.">Joshua 10:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm" title="Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,">Joshua 15:35</a>.

It also was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm" title="And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,">2Chronicles 11:9</a>).
