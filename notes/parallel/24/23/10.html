The false prophets connive at flagrant immoralities, one of which is mentioned as a typical sin. As to the nature of the adultery, see note on Jeremiah 5:7. <span class="cmt_word">Because of swearing</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of the curse</span>; the curse, namely, with which God punishes the guilty earth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-6.htm">Isaiah 24:6</a>, where in the original there is a paronomasia very similar to that here). <span class="cmt_word">The land mourneth</span>; a figurative expression, suggested partly by the assonance of the word for "curse." Drought is what is meant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-4.htm">Jeremiah 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-1.htm">Jeremiah 14:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pleasant places of the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the pastures of the prairie-land</span> ("wilderness" suggests ideas very alien to the context). <span class="cmt_word">Their course</span>; literally, their <span class="accented">running</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>). The subject is "the inhabitants of the land." <span class="cmt_word">Their force is not right</span>; rather, <span class="accented">their might</span> (or, heroism) <span class="accented">is untruth</span>. They are "mighty men" only in telling untruths (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:9-22 The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelites into idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets of Jerusalem as guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the people were made bold in sin. These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.</body></html>
