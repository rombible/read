(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-12.htm" title="Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-15.htm" title="They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.">Jeremiah 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-23.htm" title="And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.">Jeremiah 11:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their way shall be unto them as slippery ways</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">slippery places</span>. The passage has a manifest affinity with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a> (in one of the Jeremiahizing psalms; see on Jeremiah 18:19, 20). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be driven on</span>; or, as Ewald, taking over the last word of the preceding clause, <span class="accented">they shall be thrust into the darkness</span>. This involves a reminiscence, probable enough, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a> b. It is against the accentual tradition, but improves the rhythmical derision of the verse. If we ask who "thrusts" them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> supplies the answer - it is not merely external circumstances, but "the Angel of Jehovah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah himself. As Bishop Hall says, "God wounds us by many instruments, but with one hand." <span class="cmt_word">I will bring evil upon them</span>, etc. Favorite expressions of Jeremiah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-23.htm">Jeremiah 11:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:9-22 The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelites into idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets of Jerusalem as guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the people were made bold in sin. These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.</body></html>
