It is noticeable that the Hebrew verb for "hath <span class= "ital">said</span>" is not the same as the received formula of the true prophets, "The Lord hath <span class= "ital">spoken." </span>The prophet seems to indicate in this way that those whom he condemns placed the Divine message on a level with a man's every-day utterance.

The Septuagint and the Syriac render the same text (the consonants are alone the text) with different vowels, thus: "Unto those who despise the word of the Lord." In favor of this it may be urged that the phrase, "The Lord hath said," is nowhere else used in this abrupt way to introduce a real or supposed revelation, and Hitzig and Graf accordingly accept it. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall have peace</span>; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">After the imagination</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the stubbornness</span> (see on Jeremiah 3:17). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:9-22 The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelites into idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets of Jerusalem as guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the people were made bold in sin. These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.</body></html>
