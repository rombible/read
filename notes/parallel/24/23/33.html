It passed, however, as the English equivalent has done, through many shades of meaning, and became, in the language of the prophets, one of the received terms for a solemn, emphatic utterance. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-22.htm" title="And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.">1Chronicles 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm" title="And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had on him an ephod of linen.">1Chronicles 15:27</a> it is applied to the chanted music of the Temple. Isaiah had brought it into use (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>), and employs it twelve times as the title of special prophecies. Jeremiah never uses it of his own messages, probably, as this verse indicates, because it had become a favourite formula with the false prophets. This seems a more rational view than that which assumes that the false prophets applied the words in mockery to his utterances as being "burdens" in the ordinary sense of the word, oppressive and intolerable.<p><span class= "bld">What burden?</span>--The false prophets had come, not without a supercilious scorn, asking, with affected grandeur, what burden, what oracle Jeremiah had from Jehovah. He repeats their question with a deeper scorn, and tells them that for them the "burden" tells of exile and shame. A different division of the words of the prophet's answer (which presents some exceptional grammatical difficulties) gives a rendering adopted by the LXX. and Vulgate, "Ye are the burden"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>it is about you and for you.<p><span class= "bld">I will even forsake you.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I will cast you off, </span>with a play upon the literal sense of the word "burden." They have made themselves too grievous to be borne. Jehovah will <span class= "ital">disburden </span>Himself of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-40.</span> - The abuse of a consecrated phrase. The prophets were accustomed to apply the term <span class="accented">massa</span> to their prophetic declarations in the sense of "oracle," or "utterance" - a sense derived from the use of the cognate verb for "to lift up the voice," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to pronounce clearly and distinctly. But the word <span class="accented">massa</span> was also in common use for "load, burden," and hence the "false prophets" applied the term derisively to Jeremiah's discourses. "Rightly does he call his word a <span class="accented">massa</span>; it is not merely a solemn utterance, but a heavy burden; as De Wette puts it, not merely a <span class="accented">Weissagung</span>, but a <span class="accented">Wehsagung</span>. The passage is important as indicating the sense in which the true prophets understood the term. It should be added that the term mused is prefixed to at least four Biblical passages which, not being of threatening import, do not admit of being entitled "burdens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>). How remarkable is the line adopted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a> He simply abandons the use Of the term <span class="accented">massa</span>, consecrated as it was by the practice of inspired men! Better to adopt a new phrase, than to run the risk of misunderstanding or, even worse, profanity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What burden</span>? etc. The Hebrew text, as usually read, is extremely difficult; the Authorized Version is entirely unjustifiable. It is just possible to explain, with Ewald, "As to this question, What is the burden? the true meaning of the word is that," etc. But how harsh and artificial! By a change in the grouping of the consonants (which alone constitute the text), we may read, <span class="accented">Ye are the burden</span>. So the Septuagint, Vulgate, Hitzig, Graf, Payne Smith. We must in this case continue, <span class="accented">and I will cast you off</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the same verb is to be rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>. Instead of carrying you with the long-suffering of a father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>), I will east you off as a troublesome load (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:33-40 Those are miserable indeed who are forsaken and forgotten of God; and men's jesting at God's judgments will not baffle them. God had taken Israel to be a people near to him, but they shall now be cast out of his presence. It is a mark of great and daring impiety for men to jest with the words of God. Every idle and profane word will add to the sinner's burden in the day of judgment, when everlasting shame will be his portion.</body></html>
