The false prophets acted as if God were far away out of their sight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm" title="He has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it.">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm" title="And they say, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm" title="Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.">Psalm 94:7</a>), not knowing or caring what men did, as if their affairs, as it has been epigrammatically said, came under a "colonial department." The true prophet feels that He is equally near, equally God, in all places alike. Familiar as the word omnipresence is to us--so familiar as almost to have lost its power--the fact, when we realise it, is as awful now as it was when it presented itself to the souls of Patriarch, Psalmist, or Prophet. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm" title="And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, You God see me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that sees me?">Genesis 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/32-6.htm" title="For this shall every one that is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near to him.">Psalm 32:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-23.htm" title="Nevertheless I am continually with you: you have held me by my right hand.">Psalm 73:23-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/139-7.htm" title="Where shall I go from your spirit? or where shall I flee from your presence?">Psalm 139:7-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/9-2.htm" title="Though they dig into hell, there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, there will I bring them down:">Amos 9:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/11-8.htm" title="It is as high as heaven; what can you do? deeper than hell; what can you know?">Job 11:8-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-32.</span> - Jehovah has observed and will punish the false pretensions of the prophets. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Am I a God at hand</span>, etc.? ("At hand" equivalent to "near.") Eliphaz may again assist us with an illustration. "And thou sayest " - he is expostulating with Job - "What doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; yea, he walketh upon the vault of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13, 14</a>). It might seem, from the preponderance of the false prophets ever the true, as if Jehovah were unaware of the mischief. Not so; Jehovah is omnipresent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:23-32 Men cannot be hidden from God's all-seeing eye. Will they never see what judgments they prepare for themselves? Let them consider what a vast difference there is between these prophecies and those delivered by the true prophets of the Lord. Let them not call their foolish dreams Divine oracles. The promises of peace these prophets make are no more to be compared to God's promises than chaff to wheat. The unhumbled heart of man is like a rock; if not melted by the word of God as a fire, it will be broken to pieces by it as a hammer. How can they be long safe, or at all easy, who have a God of almighty power against them? The word of God is no smooth, lulling, deceitful message. And by its faithfulness it may certainly be distinguished from false doctrines.</body></html>
