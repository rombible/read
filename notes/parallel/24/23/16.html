This was then, as always, the crucial test between the true prophet and the false. The one roused the conscience, caused pain and anger by his reproofs; the other soothed and quieted men with a false assurance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm" title="They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.">Jeremiah 14:13</a>). They invented a vision which did not come to them from the mouth of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-22.</span> - A warning addressed to the people against the false prophecies (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They make you vain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fill you with vain imaginations.

These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.</body></html>
