If men continued to apply it to the words of their own heart, they would find it a "burden" in another sense (the prophet plays once more on the etymology of the word) too heavy to be borne. This would be the righteous punishment of the reckless levity with which they had treated the sacred Name which Jeremiah reproduces in all the amplitude of its grandeur.

Every idle and profane word will add to the sinner's burden in the day of judgment, when everlasting shame will be his portion.</body></html>
