In the Hebrew order and punctuation of the words this is shown still more clearly--<span class= "ital">Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me</span>--the first words being the superscription and title of what follows. The four clauses describe the varied phenomena of horror and amazement, and then comes the cause of the horror--the contrast between the words of Jehovah and His holiness on the one side, and the wickedness of priests and prophets on the other. The whole section is the complement of that which denounced the wickedness of the pastors--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the civil rulers--in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-1.htm" title="Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-40.</span> - These verses form a complete prophecy, the title of which Jeremiah himself supplies in the words, "Concerning the (false) prophets" (see below); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 7, 23, 28</a>. It is true the rendering of the Authorized Version (ver. 9), <span class="cmt_word">Mine heart within me is broken</span> <span class="cmt_word">because of the prophets</span>, is not purely arbitrary; it is favored by the exegetical tradition represented by the Hebrew accents. But it is not probable that two entirely different causes should be given for the prophet's deep emotion (see the latter part of the verse). Besides, "breaking of the heart" is nowhere a sign of anger (as Authorized Version would suggest), but either of grief (see on Jeremiah 8:20, or, as the context implies here, physical disturbance at the solemn message of Jehovah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All my bones shake</span>.

These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.</body></html>
