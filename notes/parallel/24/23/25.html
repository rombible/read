Dreams took their place among the recognised channels of divine revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm" title="And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.">Genesis 40:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-16.htm" title="And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.">Genesis 41:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-1.htm" title="In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.">Daniel 7:1</a>), but their frequent misuse by the false prophets brought them into discredit, and the teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a> accordingly brought the "dreamer of dreams" no less than the prophet to the test whether what he taught was in accordance with the law of Jehovah. The iteration of "I have dreamed" represents the affected solemnity with which the false prophets proclaimed their visions. Of the disparagement of dreams, consequent on this abuse, we have a striking example in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-3.htm" title="For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>, and later still in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/34-1.htm" title="The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools.">Ecclesiasticus 34:1-7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have dreamed</span>. Jeremiah mentions it as one of the marks of a false prophet that he appealed to his dreams (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>); true prophecy contented itself with less ambiguous media of communication with the unseen world. It may be objected that Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>), at any rate, and Abimelech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) received Divine revelations in dreams; but these were not officially prophets. Nathan and the contemporaries of the author of Job had messages from God by night, but these are called, not dreams, but visions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, comp. 17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>). Deuteronomy (and this is one of its striking points of agreement with Jeremiah) expressly describes a false prophet as "a dreamer of dreams" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>). Two passages in the Old Testament seem inconsistent with this discouragement of dreams as a medium of revelation - <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, where the Lord is said to make himself known to prophets by visions and dreams, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, where the prophetic dreams of the old men are one of the features of a Messianic description; but it is noteworthy that the first of these refers to the primitive period of Israel's history, and the second to the distant Messianic age. In its classical period prophecy kept itself sedulously aloof from a field on which it had such compromising companionship (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:23-32 Men cannot be hidden from God's all-seeing eye. Will they never see what judgments they prepare for themselves? Let them consider what a vast difference there is between these prophecies and those delivered by the true prophets of the Lord. Let them not call their foolish dreams Divine oracles. The promises of peace these prophets make are no more to be compared to God's promises than chaff to wheat. The unhumbled heart of man is like a rock; if not melted by the word of God as a fire, it will be broken to pieces by it as a hammer. How can they be long safe, or at all easy, who have a God of almighty power against them? The word of God is no smooth, lulling, deceitful message. And by its faithfulness it may certainly be distinguished from false doctrines.</body></html>
