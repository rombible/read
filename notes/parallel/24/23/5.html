In both cases, however, the word means a "sprout" or "scion," springing up from the root even after the tree had been cut down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>), and not a branch growing from the trunk. It is probably in reference to this prophecy that we find the name of "the Branch" (<span class= "ital">Zemach</span>) so prominent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>. Here, it is obvious, the prophet speaks of the one great Shepherd.<p><span class= "bld">A King shall reign.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">he shall reign as King, </span>the Branch or Sprout being the subject of the sentence. As with all the Messianic prophecies of this class, the thoughts of the prophet dwell on the acts and attributes of a sovereignty exercised personally on earth. Such a sovereignty, "all power in heaven and on earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18</a>), was indeed given to the Christ, but not after the fashion that men expected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - (Comp. the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15, 16</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the days come</span>. The use of the analogous phrase, "And it shall come to pass in that day," would lead us to suppose that this verse describes a fresh stage in the progress of events, as if the faithful shepherds (ver. 4) were to precede the "righteous Branch" (ver. 5). Such a view, however, is not very plausible, for the Messtab, according to prophecy, is to appear in the darkest of times. The prophet simply means to impress upon us the greatness of the revelation which he is about to communicate. <span class="cmt_word">I will raise unto David</span>. The promised Messiah, then, is certainly to be of the family of David (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A righteous Branch</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a righteous Plant</span>: the root means "to bud, or sprout." This is the first time in which the title the Plant is unmistakably applied to the Messianic King (possibly, but <span class="accented">less</span> probably, to the Messianic kings). It indicates that this great personage stands in connection with the divinely ordained and ancient royal family, but that he is in some way unique, and far surpasses his human ancestors. He "springs forth;" therefore he is not a sort of meteoric appearance, without any natural home among men, but rather the blossom of the Jewish nation, the embodiment of its highest qualities. And yet there is something extraordinary about him, for it is needful that Jehovah himself should "raise" this Plant from the almost worn-out stock of David. Note that the word rendered here in the Authorized Version "Branch" is not the same as that in the parallel passage in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). It is, however, the word employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>, which is taken by many, especially the elder interpreters (but with very doubtful justice), to be a prophecy of the Messiah. It is also the word used by Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>), as a <span class="accented">proper name</span> of the Messiah, which is one strong reason for rejecting the view mentioned above that the word rendered "the Branch," or "the Plant," is to be taken collectively as equivalent to "branches," or rather "plants" (the article is not expressed in the Hebrew). In short, this passage and the prophecies referred to in Jeremiah are exceptions to the general Old Testament usage of the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">cemakh</span>), which is elsewhere a collective term equivalent to "plantation." It is true that in ver. 4 "shepherds," in the plural, are spoken of, but there is no reason why this title should be confined to kings - it may as fairly be <span class="accented">extended</span> to the chief rulers under a king as the term "king" itself (see on Jeremiah 17:20); and true, further, that ill <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a> a continuous succession is promised of Davidic heirs to the throne, but this is not decisive in favor of the collective meaning, any more than Isaiah's later prophecy that "the [reigning Davidic] king shall reign in righteousness" disproves the strictly Messianic reference of his earlier promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. All prophecy is conditional; there may have been moral reasons why a continuance of the Davidic dynasty was held out by Jeremiah at one time as a possible prospect. (It is, however, extremely probable that <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-26</a> is the work of some other inspired writer; see <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.) The thirty-fourth chapter of Ezekiel, which is so closely parallel to this section, appears to interpret the prophecy of a single Messianic king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And a King shall reign</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and he shall reign as king</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be the realized ideal of an Israelitish king - a second David. <span class="cmt_word">And prosper</span>; or, <span class="accented">and deal wisely</span>. There is the same doubt as to the rendering of the verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a> a. The radical idea is that of wisdom, and the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> favors the alternative rendering here. <span class="cmt_word">Shall execute judgment</span>; in contrast to the neglectful conduct of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-8 Woe be to those who are set to feed God's people, but take no concern to do them good! Here is a word of comfort to the neglected sheep. Though only a remnant of God's flock is left, he will find them out, and they shall be brought to their former habitations. Christ is spoken of as a branch from David's family. He is righteous himself, and through him all his people are made righteous. Christ shall break the usurped power of Satan. All the spiritual seed of believing Abraham and praying Jacob shall be protected, and shall be saved from the guilt and dominion of sin. In the days of Christ's government in the soul, the soul dwells at ease. He is here spoken of as the Lord our Righteousness. He is so our Righteousness as no creature could be. His obedience unto death is the justifying righteousness of believers, and their title to heavenly happiness. And their sanctification, as the source of all their personal obedience is the effect of their union with him, and of the supply of this Spirit. By this name every true believer shall call him, and call upon him. We have nothing to plead but this, Christ has died, yea, rather is risen again; and we have taken him for our Lord. This righteousness which he has wrought out to the satisfaction of law and justice, becomes ours; being a free gift given to us, through the Spirit of God, who puts it upon us, clothes us with it, enables us to lay hold upon it, and claim an interest in it. The Lord our Righteousness is a sweet name to a convinced sinner; to one that has felt the guilt of sin in his conscience; seen his need of that righteousness, and the worth of it. This great salvation is far more glorious than all former deliverances of his church. May our souls be gathered to Him, and be found in him.</body></html>
