The plural is noticeable, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm" title="And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.">Jeremiah 3:15</a>, as not limiting the prophecy to the Christ who is yet the "chief Shepherd" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1Peter 5:4</a>). In the verb for "set up" there is an allusive reference to the names of Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin, into both of which it entered. Jehovah would "raise up" shepherds, but not such as they had proved themselves to be.<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall they be lacking.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the flock would be so cared for that not one sheep should be lost. Care extending even to every individual member was the true ideal of the Shepherd's work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>), and therefore of the ruler's.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will set up shepherds</span>; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> rulers, not necessarily kings (see on next verse). <span class="cmt_word">Which shall feed them</span>. For the evil shepherds "fed themselves, and fed not my flock" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall fear no more.</span> Ezekiel again contributes an essential feature to the description. The neglect of the shepherds left the flock exposed to the ravages of wild beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they be lacking</span>. A speaking phrase. Too many of the sheep had fallen down precipices or been carried off by lions. Yet the context rather favors a slight and palaeographically natural emendation of Hitzig, "Neither shall they be terrified." The Septuagint omits the word altogether, which favors the supposition that they read as Hitzig would read, for they are apt to condense by omitting synonyms. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-8 Woe be to those who are set to feed God's people, but take no concern to do them good! Here is a word of comfort to the neglected sheep. Though only a remnant of God's flock is left, he will find them out, and they shall be brought to their former habitations. Christ is spoken of as a branch from David's family. He is righteous himself, and through him all his people are made righteous. Christ shall break the usurped power of Satan. All the spiritual seed of believing Abraham and praying Jacob shall be protected, and shall be saved from the guilt and dominion of sin. In the days of Christ's government in the soul, the soul dwells at ease. He is here spoken of as the Lord our Righteousness. He is so our Righteousness as no creature could be. His obedience unto death is the justifying righteousness of believers, and their title to heavenly happiness. And their sanctification, as the source of all their personal obedience is the effect of their union with him, and of the supply of this Spirit. By this name every true believer shall call him, and call upon him. We have nothing to plead but this, Christ has died, yea, rather is risen again; and we have taken him for our Lord. This righteousness which he has wrought out to the satisfaction of law and justice, becomes ours; being a free gift given to us, through the Spirit of God, who puts it upon us, clothes us with it, enables us to lay hold upon it, and claim an interest in it. The Lord our Righteousness is a sweet name to a convinced sinner; to one that has felt the guilt of sin in his conscience; seen his need of that righteousness, and the worth of it. This great salvation is far more glorious than all former deliverances of his church. May our souls be gathered to Him, and be found in him.</body></html>
