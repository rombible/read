The prophet's interpretation of the image. It is the judicial anger of Jehovah, personified as Divine manifestations so often are (hence "shall not return"). The form of the verse reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the latter days</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in future days</span>, as Dr. Henderson rightly renders. It seems better to restrict the term "latter days" to the Messianic period ("the coming age," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>), to which, in fact, it is often applied (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). The phrase in itself simply means "in the sequel of the days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the future; its Messianic reference, when this exists, is inferred solely from the context. In the passage before us, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30, 30</a>:29, there can be no intention of pointing to the Messianic age. Precisely the same phrase occurs in an Assyrian inscription, where its meaning is clear from the context (<span class="accented">aria akhrat yumi irib</span>, "For a sequel of days - i.e., for a future time - I deposited"). In the present case it is no distant period to which the prophet refers, for he continues, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall consider it</span>, etc., or rather, <span class="accented">ye shall understand it clearly</span>, viz. that the calamities which will have come upon you are the Divine judgment upon your sins. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:9-22 The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelites into idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets of Jerusalem as guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the people were made bold in sin. These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.</body></html>
