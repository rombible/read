He had to leave the city by the entrance known as the gate of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), on the north side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>). The officer in command, Irijah, the son of Shelemiah (probably, therefore, the brother of Jehucal, who is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.">Jeremiah 37:3</a>, and so probably acquainted with Jeremiah's last prophetic utterance), charged him with treachery. He was "falling away to the Chaldaeans." It was assumed that, though the Chaldaeans had gone, the prophet was about to make his way to their encampment to incite them to return, and so work out the fulfilment of his own prediction. The very phrase "thou fallest away" may have been an allusive reference to Jeremiah's own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>, if, with the best critics, we refer those words to an earlier date than the raising of the siege.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gate of Benjamin;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate looking northwards towards Benjamin (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>).

Jeremiah was seized as a deserter, and committed to prison. But it is no new thing for the best friends of the church to be belied, as in the interests of her worst enemies. When thus falsely accused, we may deny the charge, and commit our cause to Him who judges righteously. Jeremiah obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, and would not, to obtain mercy of man, be unfaithful to God or to his prince; he tells the king the whole truth. When Jeremiah delivered God's message, he spake with boldness; but when he made his own request, he spake submissively. A lion in God's cause must be a lamb in his own. And God gave Jeremiah favour in the eyes of the king. The Lord God can make even the cells of a prison become pastures to his people, and will raise up friends to provide for them, so that in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</body></html>
