Of the severity with which the prophet was treated there, we may judge from his entreaty not to be taken back there after his release (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-26.htm" title="Then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.">Jeremiah 38:26</a>). We have fairly adequate data for measuring the duration of the "many days" of his imprisonment. It began before the second siege of Jerusalem, which lasted for nearly two years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.">2Kings 25:1-3</a>), and when the city was taken he was still in the court of the prison. The incidents of Jeremiah 32-34 belong to this period.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes were wroth with Jeremiah</span>. As Graf has pointed out, the princes, who had evinced their respect for Jeremiah on former occasions (ch. 26, 36.) had probably shared the captivity of Jehoiachin; Zedekiah's "princes" would be of a lower origin and type, and ready (like the judges in the French "terror") to accept any charge against an unpopular person without proper examination. <span class="cmt_word">The house of Jonathan the scribe</span>. "Scribe," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of the secretaries of state. The house of Jonathan seems to have been specially adapted for a prison, as the next verse shows. Chardin, the old traveller, remarks, "The Eastern prisons are not public buildings erected for that purpose, but a part of the house in which the criminal judges dwell. As the governor and provost of a town, or the captain of the watch, imprison such as are accused in their own houses, they set apart a canton of them for that purpose when they are put into these offices, and choose for the jailor the most proper person they can find of their domestics" (Chardin). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:11-21 There are times when it is the wisdom of good men to retire, to enter into their chambers, and to shut the doors, Isa 26:20. Jeremiah was seized as a deserter, and committed to prison. But it is no new thing for the best friends of the church to be belied, as in the interests of her worst enemies. When thus falsely accused, we may deny the charge, and commit our cause to Him who judges righteously. Jeremiah obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, and would not, to obtain mercy of man, be unfaithful to God or to his prince; he tells the king the whole truth. When Jeremiah delivered God's message, he spake with boldness; but when he made his own request, he spake submissively. A lion in God's cause must be a lamb in his own. And God gave Jeremiah favour in the eyes of the king. The Lord God can make even the cells of a prison become pastures to his people, and will raise up friends to provide for them, so that in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</body></html>
