The fact that the Chaldaeans had raised the siege gave him free egress.<p><span class= "bld">To separate himself thence in the midst of the people.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">to take a share from thence in the midst of the people. </span>This gives probably the ostensible reason of his journey. As a priest belonging to Anathoth, he had property (like that which he afterwards bought of his uncle, Jeremiah 32) in the land of Benjamin, and he now went to look after it, either in the way of ploughing and sowing, or to receive his share of its produce during his sojourn in Jerusalem. If, as seems probable from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/34-8.htm" title="This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;">Jeremiah 34:8-16</a>, this was a Sabbatical year, the former, assuming the siege to have been raised when the year was over, would be the more probable alternative, and would better explain, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-2.htm" title="And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. And they sat down.">Ruth 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-9.htm" title="And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.">Ruth 4:9</a>, the addition of the clause "in the midst of the people," as showing that there was nothing clandestine in his proceedings. Other meanings that have been given to the words, "to buy bread," "to till a field," "to separate a field," <span class= "ital">"</span>to conciliate," "to divide the spoil," are less satisfactory. At such a time all the owners of land would be eager to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the departure of the Chaldaean army to transact any business connected with it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - As soon as communication with the outside world was possible, Jeremiah took the opportunity of going to his native country, to obtain something or other which he could only obtain "thence." The Authorized Version says that his object was <span class="cmt_word">to separate himself thence.</span> But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the rendering is linguistically untenable; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the assumed object is incongruous with the circumstances and Character of Jeremiah, who was neither inclined to seek safety in isolation nor had any motive at present for doing so. The only safe rendering is, <span class="accented">to claim his share thence.</span> Whether there was just then a reallotment of communal lands must be left undecided; this would, however, be the most plausible hypothesis, if we could be sure that the present was a sabbatical year. The additional words, <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the people,</span> would then acquire a special significance. The "people" would be the representatives of families who had an equal right to allotments with Jeremiah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:11-21 There are times when it is the wisdom of good men to retire, to enter into their chambers, and to shut the doors, Isa 26:20. Jeremiah was seized as a deserter, and committed to prison. But it is no new thing for the best friends of the church to be belied, as in the interests of her worst enemies. When thus falsely accused, we may deny the charge, and commit our cause to Him who judges righteously. Jeremiah obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, and would not, to obtain mercy of man, be unfaithful to God or to his prince; he tells the king the whole truth. When Jeremiah delivered God's message, he spake with boldness; but when he made his own request, he spake submissively. A lion in God's cause must be a lamb in his own. And God gave Jeremiah favour in the eyes of the king. The Lord God can make even the cells of a prison become pastures to his people, and will raise up friends to provide for them, so that in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</body></html>
