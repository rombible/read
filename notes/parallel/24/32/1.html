After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.">Nehemiah 3:25</a>). It would appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm" title="Why the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.">Jeremiah 37:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-26.htm" title="Then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.">Jeremiah 38:26</a>, both of an earlier date than this chapter, that he had previously been confined in the house of Jonathan the scribe as a private prison, and that the king had removed him thence with a view to consulting him on the probable issue of the siege. He was not allowed to leave his prison, but friends were permitted to have access to him.<p>(3. 4) <span class= "bld">Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon . . .</span>--A comparison of these verses with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/34-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus said the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:">Jeremiah 34:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-23.htm" title="So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans: and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.">Jeremiah 38:23</a>, shows that Jeremiah never for a moment varied in his tone. To see the king of Babylon face to face, to stand before him in shame and confusion--that was to be the end of the king's frantic resistance to the Divine purpose. The prophecy of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm" title="My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.">Ezekiel 12:13</a>), and the fact that Nebuchadnezzar put out the eyes of the captive king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-7.htm" title="Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:7</a>), give a special force to Jeremiah's word. The face of the great king, in all the terror of his wrath, was to be the last object Zedekiah was to behold on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-6.htm" title="So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.">2Kings 25:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-6.htm" title="Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/52-10.htm" title="And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.">Jeremiah 52:10-11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - Time and circumstances of the following revelation. It took place in the tenth year of Zedekiah, the eighteenth of Nebuchadnezzar (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>). The siege of Jerusalem had Begun in the preceding year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>), but had been temporarily raised on the approach of an Egyptian army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5, 11</a>). Jeremiah, who had declared resistance hopeless, had been accused of treason, and imprisoned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>), and in prison he remained till the close of the siege. Like St. Paul at Rome, however, he was allowed free communication with visitors, as appears from ver. 8 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>. Vers. 2-5 are parenthetical (see on ver. 6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-15 Jeremiah, being in prison for his prophecy, purchased a piece of ground. This was to signify, that though Jerusalem was besieged, and the whole country likely to be laid waste, yet the time would come, when houses, and fields, and vineyards, should be again possessed. It concerns ministers to make it appear that they believe what they preach to others. And it is good to manage even our worldly affairs in faith; to do common business with reference to the providence and promise of God.</body></html>
