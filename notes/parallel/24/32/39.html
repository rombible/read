<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>;

and they shall say, You are my God.">Hosea 2:23</a>). Here a new feature is added. The prophet, in his vision of the future, in place of the discords of the present--some serving Jehovah, and some Baal and Molech; some urging submission to Babylon, and some intriguing with Egypt--sees a unity in faith showing itself in unity of action. The hope of Jeremiah has never yet been realised, but it has appeared as with a transfigured glory in the prayer of the Christ for His people that they "all may be one," even as He and the Father are one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21-23</a>), in the prayer of the Apostle, that all might be joined together "in the unity of the faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>). And that prayer also waits for its fulfilment, and receives only partial and (to use Bacon's phrase) "germinant" accomplishments. "For ever" represents the Hebrew <span class= "ital">all the days.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One heart, and one way.</span> Unity is always given as the "note" of the ideal, Messianic period (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-9.htm">Zephaniah 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they may fear me forever</span>. This reminds us of a phrase in the exhortation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>, as the next clause does of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:26-44 God's answer discovers the purposes of his wrath against that generation of the Jews, and the purposes of his grace concerning future generations. It is sin, and nothing else, that ruins them. The restoration of Judah and Jerusalem is promised. This people were now at length brought to despair. But God gives hope of mercy which he had in store for them hereafter. Doubtless the promises are sure to all believers. God will own them for his, and he will prove himself theirs. He will give them a heart to fear him. All true Christians shall have a disposition to mutual love. Though they may have different views about lesser things, they shall all be one in the great things of God; in their views of the evil of sin, and the low estate of fallen man, the way of salvation through the Saviour, the nature of true holiness, the vanity of the world, and the importance of eternal things. Whom God loves, he loves to the end. We have no reason to distrust God's faithfulness and constancy, but only our own hearts. He will settle them again in Canaan. These promises shall surely be performed. Jeremiah's purchase was the pledge of many a purchase that should be made after the captivity; and those inheritances are but faint resemblances of the possessions in the heavenly Canaan, which are kept for all who have God's fear in their hearts, and do not depart from him. Let us then bear up under our trials, assured we shall obtain all the good he has promised us.</body></html>
