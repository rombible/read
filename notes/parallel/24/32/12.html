Nothing is known of his father or grandfather, but the fact that both are named indicates that he belonged to the nobler families of Judah; and this is confirmed, partly by the fact that his brother Seraiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm" title="The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.">Jeremiah 51:59</a>, where see Note) held a high position in the court of Zedekiah, partly by Josephus, who describes him as of "a very illustrious house," and "highly educated" (<span class= "ital">Ant. </span>x. 6, ? 12). The mention of Chelcias (the Greek form for Hilkiah) among his ancestors, in the apocryphal book that bears his name (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/baruch/1-1.htm" title="And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,">Baruch 1:1</a>), may indicate a connection with the family of the high-priest in the reign of Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/22-4.htm" title="Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:">2Kings 22:4-14</a>), and we may find in this fact an explanation of his regard tor Jeremiah. In relation to the prophet, he appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-4.htm" title="Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book.">Jeremiah 36:4</a> as acting as his secretary, as accused of instigating Jeremiah to preach submission to the Chaldaeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-3.htm" title="But Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.">Jeremiah 43:3</a>), as sharing his sufferings and dangers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-26.htm" title="But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.">Jeremiah 36:26</a>), and, according to Josephus (as above), as thrown into prison with him. He was probably an influential member of the Chaldaean party in the court of Judah, protesting against the policy which courted an alliance with Egypt and entered into intrigues and schemes of rebellion against the power of Babylon. The book that bears his name is probably pseudonymous, but it bears witness, in the very fact of its being ascribed to him, to the importance of the position which he occupied in the politics of the time. Here he is present as at least visiting the prophet in prison, even if he did not share his imprisonment, and Jeremiah hands over the deeds of conveyance to his custody.<p><span class= "bld">Before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.</span>--The incidental mention of these is interesting, as showing the freedom of access which was permitted to the prisoner. Looking to the freedom and fulness of the prayer that follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/32-17.htm" title="Ah Lord GOD! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you:">Jeremiah 32:17-25</a>), it is a legitimate inference that they formed, as it were, a congregation of disciples, on whom the prophet sought to impress, by the transaction of the purchase, his own sure and certain hope of the restoration of his people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-15 Jeremiah, being in prison for his prophecy, purchased a piece of ground. This was to signify, that though Jerusalem was besieged, and the whole country likely to be laid waste, yet the time would come, when houses, and fields, and vineyards, should be again possessed. It concerns ministers to make it appear that they believe what they preach to others. And it is good to manage even our worldly affairs in faith; to do common business with reference to the providence and promise of God.</body></html>
