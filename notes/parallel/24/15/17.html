What is meant is, that from the time of his consecration to his office the prophet's life had not been as the life of other men, but had been marked by a strange loneliness, filled with the consuming wrath of Jehovah against the evils that surrounded him. The "hand" of Jehovah is used here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, for the special overpowering consciousness of the fulness of inspiration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of the mockers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the laughers</span>. The serious thoughts arising out of his sacred office restrained him from taking part in the festive meetings to which his youth would naturally incline him (comp. on Jeremiah 16:2). <span class="cmt_word">Because of thy hand</span>. The Hand of Jehovah is a figurative expression for the self-revealing and irresistible power of Jehovah; it is, therefore, equivalent to the Arm of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), but is used in preference with regard to the divinely ordained actions and words of the prophets. Thus we are told, in the accounts of Elijah and Elisha, that "the hand of the Lord came upon" them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>). Such a phrase was probably at first descriptive of a completely passive ecstatic state, and was retained when ecstasies had become rare, with a somewhat laxer meaning. Isaiah uses a similar expression but once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>); Ezekiel, however, who appears to have been unusually rifled with the overpowering thought of the supernatural world, is constantly mentioning "the hand of Jehovah" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a>; and especially Ezekiel 3:14; 8:3). We may infer from this variation in the practice of inspired writers that, though symbolical, anthropomorphic language is not always equally necessary in speaking of Divine things, yet it cannot be entirely dispensed with, even by the most gifted and spiritual teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast filled me with indignation</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hadst filled me</span>. Jeremiah was too full of his Divine message to indulge in impracticable sentimentalities. There was no thought of self when Jeremiah received his mission, nor any bitterness towards those who up-posed him. His "indignation" was that of Jehovah, whose simple instrument he was (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>, "I am full of the fury of the Lord"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:15-21 It is matter of comfort that we have a God, to whose knowledge of all things we may appeal. Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it. Many things appear frightful, which do not at all hurt a real believer in Christ.</body></html>
