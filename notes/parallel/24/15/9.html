"Seven," as the perfect number, represented, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm" title="They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.">1Samuel 2:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-15.htm" title="And he shall be to you a restorer of your life, and a nourisher of your old age: for your daughter in law, which loves you, which is better to you than seven sons, has born him.">Ruth 4:15</a>, the typical completeness of the family.<p><span class= "bld">Her sun is gone down while it was yet day.</span>--The image of this eclipse of all joy and brightness may possibly have been suggested by the actual eclipse of the sun (total in Palestine), Sept. 30; B.C. 610, the year of the battle of Megiddo, just as the earthquake in the reign of Uzziah suggested much of the imagery of Isaiah and Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm" title="And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he rises to shake terribly the earth.">Isaiah 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/1-1.htm" title="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.">Amos 1:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm" title="I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm" title="And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.">Zechariah 14:5</a>). A like image meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:">Amos 8:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That hath borne seven</span>; a proverbial expression (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Her sun is gone down</span>, etc. The figure is that of an eclipse (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">She hath been ashamed</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">she ashamed</span>, etc. Ewald supposes the sun, which is sometimes feminine in Hebrew, to be the subject (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>); but the view of the Authorized Version is more probable. The shame of childlessness is repeatedly referred to (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1, 23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must have pleaded in vain. The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.</body></html>
