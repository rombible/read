They are "sweeter than honey and the honeycomb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm" title="More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.">Psalm 19:10</a>). They are incorporated with its life, are "the rejoicing of its heart." He is called by the Name of "the Lord God of hosts," or, more literally, that Name <span class= "ital">is called upon him. </span>As the witness of his special consecration, he becomes, like other prophets, "a man of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm" title="Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.">2Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1Timothy 6:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy words were found</span>. Jeremiah here describes his first reception of a Divine revelation. Truth is like "treasure hid in a field;" he alone who seeks it with an unprejudiced mind can "find" it. But there are some things which no "searching" of the intellect can "find" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>); yet by a special revelation they may be "found" by God's "spokesmen," or prophets. This is the train of thought which underlies Jeremiah's expression here. The "words," or revelations, of Jehovah are regarded as having an objective existence in the ideal world of which God is the light, and as "descending" from thence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>) into the consciousness of the prophet. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>, "Eat that thou findest." <span class="cmt_word">I did eat them</span>; I assimilated them, as it were (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am called by thy name</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thy name hath been</span> (or, <span class="accented">had been</span>) <span class="accented">called upon me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have (or, had) been specially dedicated to thy service. The phrase is often used of Israel (see on Jeremiah 14:9), and, as here applied, intimates that a faithful prophet was, as it were, the embodied ideal of an Israelite. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:15-21 It is matter of comfort that we have a God, to whose knowledge of all things we may appeal. Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it. Many things appear frightful, which do not at all hurt a real believer in Christ.</body></html>
