If we admit a dislocation, of which there seem many signs, we may connect them with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/15-5.htm" title="For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan you? or who shall go aside to ask how you do?">Jeremiah 15:5-6</a>, and then they are spoken to Jerusalem. The recurrence of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/17-3.htm" title="O my mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures to the spoil, and your high places for sin, throughout all your borders.">Jeremiah 17:3-4</a>, as addressed to the mountain of the plain, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Zion, makes this probable.<p><span class= "bld">Without price.</span>--As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-12.htm" title="You sell your people for nothing, and do not increase your wealth by their price.">Psalm 44:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-3.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, You have sold yourselves for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money.">Isaiah 52:3</a>, this implies the extremest abandonment. The enemies of Israel were to have an easy victory, for which they would not have to pay the usual price of blood; nor did God, on His side, demand from them any payment for the victory He bestowed. He gave away His people as men give that which they count worthless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy substance</span>, etc. These verses form an unlooked-for digression. The prophet has been in a state of profound melancholy, and the object of Jehovah is to rouse him from it. In Vers. 11, 12, the most encouraging assurances have been given him. Suddenly comes the overwhelming declaration contained in Vers. 13, 14. And when we look closely at these verses, two points strike us, which make it difficult to conceive that Jeremiah intended them to stand here. First, their contents are not at all adapted to Jeremiah, and clearly belong to the people of Judah; and next, they are repeated, with some variations, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>. It should also be observed that the Septuagint (which omits <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1-4</a>) only gives them here, which seems to indicate an early opinion that the passage only ought to occur once in the Book of Jeremiah, though the Septuagint translator failed to choose the right position for it. <span class="cmt_word">Without price;</span> literally, not for a price. In the parallel passage there is another reading, "thy high places," which forms part of the next clause. Hitzig and Graf suppose this to be the original reading, the Hebrew letters having been partly effaced and then misread, after which "not" was prefixed to make sense. However this may be, the present reading is unintelligible, if we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>, where Jehovah declares that his people were sold for nothing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were given up entirely to the enemy, without any compensating advantage to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And that for all thy sins,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">and in all thy sins and in all thy borders</span>. The text is certainly difficult. Externally a parallelism exists between the two halves of the clause, and one is therefore tempted to render literally. As this will not make sense, however, we are forced either to render as the Authorized Version, or to suppose that the text is not accurately preserved. The parallel passage has a different but not a more intelligible reading. Ewald omits "and" in both halves of the clause, which slightly diminishes the awkwardness. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make thee to pass</span>, etc. The natural rendering of the Hebrew is, "And I will make thine enemies to pass," etc., which clearly cannot be the prophet's meaning. The parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>) has, "And I will make thee to serve thine enemies," etc.; and so the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Targum, and many manuscripts here. <span class="cmt_word">For a fire is kindled in mine anger</span>; a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, suggesting that the judgment described in the Song of Moses is about to fall upon Judah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:10-14 Jeremiah met with much contempt and reproach, when they ought to have blessed him, and God for him. It is a great and sufficient support to the people of God, that however troublesome their way may be, it shall be well with them in their latter end. God turns to the people. Shall the most hardy and vigorous of their efforts be able to contend with the counsel of God, or with the army of the Chaldeans? Let them hear their doom. The enemy will treat the prophet well. But the people who had great estates would be used hardly. All parts of the country had added to the national guilt; and let each take shame to itself.</body></html>
