One who could honestly speak of himself in terms such as those of Vers. 16, 17, seemed to have a special claim on the Divine protection. But Jeremiah's hopes have been disappointed. His vexation is perpetual, and his wounded spirit finds no comfort. <span class="cmt_word">As a liar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a deceitful stream</span>. The word "stream" has to be understood as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>. Many of the water courses of Palestine are filled with a rushing torrent in the winter, but dry in summer. Hence the pathetic complaint of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>). The opposite phrase to that used by Jeremiah is "a perennial stream" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>). The force of the passage is increased if we read it in the light of Dr. Gratz's hypothesis. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:15-21 It is matter of comfort that we have a God, to whose knowledge of all things we may appeal. Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it. Many things appear frightful, which do not at all hurt a real believer in Christ.</body></html>
