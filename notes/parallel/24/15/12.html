That which most harmonises with the context (assuming this verse to carry on the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/15-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.">Jeremiah 15:1-9</a>, after the interruption, possibly the interpolation, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them does curse me.">Jeremiah 15:10-11</a>) is, that the prayer of the prophet, strong though it may be, cannot change the inflexible purpose of Jehovah to chastise His people's sins. Some have, however, taken the words as declaring (1) the powerlessness of Judah to resist the titanic strength of the Chaldaeans, or (2) the impotence of the prophet's enemies to deter him from his work, or (3) the prophet's want of power against the obdurate evil of the people, or (4) the weakness of Pharaoh-nechoh as compared with Nebuchadnezzar. Of these (3) has a show of plausibility from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm" title="For, behold, I have made you this day a defended city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm" title="And I will make you to this people a fenced brazen wall: and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 15:20</a>, but does not harmonise so well with what precedes and follows. The "northern iron" is probably that of the Chalybes of Pontus, mentioned as the "artificers in iron" by 'schylus (<span class= "ital">Prom. Bound, </span>733), as the coast of the Euxine is called by him the land which is "the mother of iron" (<span class= "ital">Ibid. </span>309), famous for being harder than all others. For "steel" we should read <span class= "ital">bronze. </span>The word is commonly translated "brass," but that compound, in its modern sense, was unknown to the metallurgy of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall iron break</span>, etc.? Again an enigmatical saying. The rendering of the Authorized Version assumes that <span class="cmt_word">by the northern iron</span> Jeremiah means the Babylonian empire. But the "breaking" of the Babylonian empire was not a subject which lay within the thoughts of the prophet. It was not the fate of Babylon, but his own troubled existence, and the possibility that his foes would ultimately succeed in crushing him, which disquieted this conscientious but timid spokesman of Jehovah. The Divine interlocutor has reminded him in the preceding verse of the mercy which has been already extended to him, and now recalls to his recollection the encouraging assurances given him in his inaugural vision (Jeremiah h 18, 19). Render, therefore, Can one <span class="accented">break iron</span>, <span class="accented">northern iron</span>, <span class="accented">and bronze?</span> The steel of the Authorized Version is evidently a slip. The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">n'khosheth</span>, which means sometimes (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-25.htm">Deuteronomy 33:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>) copper, but more commonly bronze, since "copper unalloyed seems to have been but rarely used after its alloys with tin became known" (Professor Maskelyne). "Steel" would have been more fitly introduced as the second of the three names of metals. "Northern iron" at once suggests the Chalybes, famous in antiquity for their skill in hardening iron, and, according to classical authors (e.g. Stephanus the geographer), the neighbors of the Tibareni, in the country adjoining the Euxine Sea, the Tibareni being, of course, the people of Tubal, whom Ezekiel mentions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>) as trafficking in vessels of bronze. Any Jew, familiar with the wares of the bazaar, would at once appreciate the force of such a question as this. Even if iron could be broken, yet surely not steel nor bronze. Thus the verse simply reaffirms the original promises to Jeremiah, and prepares the way for Vers. 20, 21. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:10-14 Jeremiah met with much contempt and reproach, when they ought to have blessed him, and God for him. It is a great and sufficient support to the people of God, that however troublesome their way may be, it shall be well with them in their latter end. God turns to the people. Shall the most hardy and vigorous of their efforts be able to contend with the counsel of God, or with the army of the Chaldeans? Let them hear their doom. The enemy will treat the prophet well. But the people who had great estates would be used hardly. All parts of the country had added to the national guilt; and let each take shame to itself.</body></html>
