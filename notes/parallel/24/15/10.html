Possibly, as some have thought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them does curse me.">Jeremiah 15:10-11</a> have been misplaced in transcription, and should come after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-14.htm" title="And I will make you to pass with your enemies into a land which you know not: for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.">Jeremiah 15:14</a>, where they fit in admirably with the context. The sequence of thought may, however, be that the picture of the sorrowing mother in the previous verses suggests the reflection that there may be other causes for a mother's sorrow than that of which he has spoken, and so he bursts out into the cry, "Woe is me, my mother!" The prophet feels more than ever the awfulness of his calling as a vessel of God's truth. He, too, found that he had come "not to send peace on earth, but a sword" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-34.htm" title="Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.">Matthew 10:34</a>). His days were as full of strife as the life of the usurer, whose quarrels with his debtors had become the proverbial type of endless litigation. As examples of the working of the law of debt, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm" title="And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm" title="He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-11.htm" title="Let the extortionist catch all that he has; and let the strangers spoil his labor.">Psalm 109:11</a>.<p>We note, as characteristic of the pathetic tenderness of the prophet's character, the address to his mother. We may think of her probably as still living, and the thought of her suffering embitters her son's grief. The sword was piercing through her soul also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm" title="(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.">Luke 2:35</a>). There, too, there was a <span class= "ital">Mater dolorosa.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-21.</span> - These verses come in very unexpectedly, and are certainly not to be regarded as a continuation of the preceding discourse. They describe some deeply pathetic moment of the prophet's inner life, and in all probability belong to a later period of the history of Judah. At any rate, the appreciation of the next chapter will be facilitated by reading it in close connection with Ver. 9 of the present chapter. But the section before us is too impressive to be east adrift without an attempt to find a place for it in the life of the prophet. The attempt has been made with some plausibility by a Jewish scholar, Dr. Gratz, who considers the background of these verses to be the sojourn of Jeremiah at Ramah, referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, and groups them, therefore, with another prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>), in which Ramah is mentioned by name as the temporary abode of the Jewish captives. We are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4, 5</a>, that Jeremiah had the choice given him of either going to Babylon with the exiles, or dwelling with the Jews who were allowed to remain under Gedaliah the governor. He chose, as the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a>. tells us, to stay with Gedaliah; but the narrative could not, in accordance with the reserve which characterizes the inspired writers, reveal the state of mind in which this difficult choice was made. This omission is supplied in the paragraph before us. Jeremiah, with that lyric tendency peculiar to him among the prophets, gives a vent to his emotion in these impassioned verses. He tells his friends that the resolution to go to Gedaliah may cost him a severe struggle. He longs for rest, and in Babylon he would have more chance of a quiet life than among the turbulent Jews at home. But he has looked up to God for guidance, and, however painful to the flesh, God's will must be obeyed. He gives us the substance of the revelation which he received. The Divine counselor points out that he has already interposed in the most striking manner for Jeremiah, and declares that if he will devote himself to the Jews under Gedaliah, a new and fruitful field will be open to him, in which, moreover, by Divine appointment, no harm can happen to him. Whether this is really the background of the paragraph must remain uncertain. In a case of this kind, we are obliged to call in the help of the imagination, if the words of the prophet are to be realized with any degree of vividness. There are some great difficulties in the text, and apparently one interpolation (Vers. 13, 14 being in all probability an incorrect copy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe is me, my mother</span>! This is one of those passages (comp. Introduction) which illustrate the sensitive and shrinking character of our prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"If his meek spirit erred, opprest<br />That God denied repose,<br />What sin is ours, to whom Heaven's rest<br />Is pledged to heal earth's woes?"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Cardinal Newman, in 'Lyra Apostolica,' 88.</span>). I have neither lent on usury, etc.; a speaking figure to men of the ancient world, to whom, as Dr. Payne Smith remarks, "the relations between the money-lender and the debtor were the most fruitful source of lawsuits and quarrellings." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:10-14 Jeremiah met with much contempt and reproach, when they ought to have blessed him, and God for him. It is a great and sufficient support to the people of God, that however troublesome their way may be, it shall be well with them in their latter end. God turns to the people. Shall the most hardy and vigorous of their efforts be able to contend with the counsel of God, or with the army of the Chaldeans? Let them hear their doom. The enemy will treat the prophet well. But the people who had great estates would be used hardly. All parts of the country had added to the national guilt; and let each take shame to itself.</body></html>
