The LXX. gives the true meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at my bidding. It is the dative of cause. <span class="cmt_word">Against the mother of the young men</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon</span>... <span class="accented">young</span> man. The widow has lost her husband, the mother her son, so that no human power can repel the barbarous foe. The word rendered "young man" is specially used for "young warriors," <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">Jeremiah</span> 18:21; 49:26; 51:3. Others following Rashi, take "mother" in the sense of "metropolis," or "chief city" (see Authorized Version, margin), in which case "young man" must be connected with the participle rendered "a spoiler;" but though the word has this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a>, it is there coupled with "city," so that no doubt can exist. Hero the prophet would certainly not have used the word in so unusual a sense without giving some guide to his meaning. The rendering adopted above has the support of Ewald, Hitzig, and Dr. Payne Smith. <span class="cmt_word">At noonday</span>; at the most unlooked-for moment (see on Jeremiah 6:4). <span class="cmt_word">I have caused him</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">I have caused pangs and terrors to fall upon her suddenly</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must have pleaded in vain. The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.</body></html>
