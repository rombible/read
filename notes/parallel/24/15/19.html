The prophet also needs, not less than the people, to "return" to his true mind, to repent of his murmurings and distrust. Upon that condition only can he again "stand before" the Lord in the full sense of that word, and minister to Him as a prophet-priest (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-15.htm" title="And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to day.">1Kings 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm" title="And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.">2Kings 3:14</a>). He has to distinguish between "the precious and the vile," between the gold and the dross, between a righteous zeal and the despondent bitterness which is its spurious counterfeit, not in the people only to whom he speaks but in himself. Above all he must beware of being tempted by his sense of failure, to <span class= "ital">return </span>to the people in the temper of one who tunes his voice according to the time. Rather must they "return" to him and rise to his level, both "returning" to Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou return</span>, etc. Most commentators regard these words as containing a gentle rebuke to Jeremiah for his doubts respecting God's care of him. It may be questioned, however, whether such passing doubts could be described as a turning away from Jehovah. If the word "return" is to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, we must surely conclude that the people is addressed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a>). But this does not agree with the context. Hence Gratz's view seems very plausible, that the reference is to the proposal that Jeremiah should place himself under the protection of Gedaliah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, "Go back also to Gedaliah," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Then will I bring thee again</span>; viz. into the right relation to me, so as to be my minister (Keil). But by altering one of the vowel-points (which form no part of the text), on the authority of the Septuagint, we get a more satisfactory sense, <span class="accented">I will give thee a settled place</span>. <span class="accented">The</span> verb must in any case be coupled with the following one. Jeremiah longs for a quiet home, only as supplying the conditions of prophetic activity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt stand before me</span>. The phrase is taken from the wont of slaves to stand in their masters' presence, waiting for commands. It is also applied to courtiers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>) and royal councilors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6</a>), to angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>) and to prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>). Jeremiah was by God's will to find a new and important mission to the Jews with Gedaliah. <span class="cmt_word">If thou take forth the precious from the vile</span>, etc. The metaphor is derived from metallurgy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27-30</a>). The prophet is compared to a smelter. By the fervor of his inspired exhortations, he seeks to draw away from the mass of unbelievers all those who are spiritually capable of better things. The "vine-dressers and husbandmen," whom Nebuzar-adan had left after the capture of Jerusalem, though outwardly "the poor of the laud," might yet be ennobled by the word and example of Jeremiah. [Some explain "the precious" and "the vile" differently, taking the former to be the pure Word of God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>), the latter the base, human elements which are apt to be mixed with the Divine message (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>). But was it not the very fidelity of Jeremiah which exposed him to the persecutions of which he has been complaining? Others suppose an inward purification of Jeremiah himself to be intended, "the vile" being those human infirmities of which he had just given evidence, as opposed to "the precious," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the spiritual impulses which come from above. But is not such an explanation too evangelical, too Pauline, for this context?] <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be as my mouth</span>. For devoting himself to this possible "mustard seed" of a better and holier people, the prophet should be rewarded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by close prophetic intercourse with his God, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, as the next clause states, by a moral victory over his opponents. "Mouth" for "prophet," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let them return unto thee,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">they shall return unto thee</span>, <span class="accented">but thou shalt not return unto them</span>. They shall come over to thy side, and thou shalt not need to make humiliating advances to them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:15-21 It is matter of comfort that we have a God, to whose knowledge of all things we may appeal. Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it. Many things appear frightful, which do not at all hurt a real believer in Christ.</body></html>
