The context decides in favor of the latter view. Ewald's explanation, "borders of the earth" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the most distant countries), seems less natural. <span class="cmt_word">I will bereave them</span>, etc. The proper object of the verb is <span class="cmt_word">my people</span> (personified as a mother). The population are to fall in war (comp. the same figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>). The tense is the perfect of prophetic certitude; literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have bereaved</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must have pleaded in vain. The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.</body></html>
