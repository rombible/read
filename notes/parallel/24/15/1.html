The passage reminds us of the mention of Noah, Daniel, and Job, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm" title="Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:14</a>, as "able to deliver their own souls only by their righteousness." Here Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm" title="And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?">Exodus 32:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/14-13.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)">Numbers 14:13-20</a>) and Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm" title="And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly to the LORD: and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.">1Samuel 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-23.htm" title="Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:">1Samuel 12:23</a>) are named as having been conspicuous examples of the power of the prayer of intercession.<p><span class= "bld">Cast them out of my sight.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, from my presence, from the courts of the Temple which they profane. That would be the answer of Jehovah, even if Moses and Samuel "stood before Him" (the phrase, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, has a distinctly liturgical meaning), ministering in the Courts of the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - Second rejection of Jeremiah's intercession; awfulness of the impending judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though Moses and Samuel</span>, etc. It is a mere supposition which is here made; there is no allusion to any popular view of the intercession of saints (see my note on Isaiah 63:16). If even a Moses or a Samuel would intercede in vain, the case of the Judahites must indeed be desperate. For these were the nearest of all the prophets to Jehovah, and repeatedly prayed their people out of grievous calamity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>). Jeremiah had already sought to intercede for his people (see on Jeremiah 7:16). <span class="cmt_word">Cast them out of my sight;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Dismiss them from my presence</span>. The people are represented as praying or sacrificing in the fore courts of the temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must have pleaded in vain. The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.</body></html>
