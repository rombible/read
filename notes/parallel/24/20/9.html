God had prevailed against him, compelled him to undertake a work against his will, but he could not prevail against God. Like so much of Jeremiah's language this also came from the hymns of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-3.htm" title="My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spoke I with my tongue,">Psalm 39:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I said</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">And when I say</span>, <span class="accented">I will not make mention of him</span>, etc., then <span class="accented">it becometh</span> (i.e. I am conscious of a feeling) <span class="accented">in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones</span>; <span class="accented">and I weary myself to hold it in</span>, <span class="accented">but cannot</span>. The prophet has repeatedly been tempted to withdraw from the painful duty, but his other and higher self (comp. 'Old Self and New Self' in the 'Lyra Apostolica') overpowers these lower bayings for peace and quiet. The fire of the Divine wrath against sin burns so fiercely within him that he cannot help resuming his work. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:7-13 The prophet complains of the insult and injury he experienced. But ver. 7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory. Let the people of God open their cause before Him, and he will enable them to see deliverance.</body></html>
