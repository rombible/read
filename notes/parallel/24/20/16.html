So deeply imprinted was the tradition on the Hebrew mind, that a special word was appropriated to it, which at once called up thoughts of the awful justice of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a> (?); 13:19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> [22]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-40.htm">Jeremiah 50:40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The cry... the shouting.</span> The cry of the besieged for help; the shouting of the suddenly appearing assailants (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:14-18 When grace has the victory, it is good to be ashamed of our folly, to admire the goodness of God, and be warned to guard our spirits another time. See how strong the temptation was, over which the prophet got the victory by Divine assistance! He is angry that his first breath was not his last. While we remember that these wishes are not recorded for us to utter the like, we may learn good lessons from them. See how much those who think they stand, ought to take heed lest they fall, and to pray daily, Lead us not into temptation. How frail, changeable, and sinful is man! How foolish and unnatural are the thoughts and wishes of our hearts, when we yield to discontent! Let us consider Him who endured the contradiction of sinners against himself, lest we should be at any time weary and faint in our minds under our lesser trials.</body></html>
