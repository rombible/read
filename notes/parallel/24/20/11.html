He passes through the deep waters, but struggles out of them to the rock of refuge. The word "terrible" was used with a special significance. Jehovah had promised to deliver the prophet from the "terrible" ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-21.htm" title="And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.">Jeremiah 15:21</a>).

But ver. 7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory. Let the people of God open their cause before Him, and he will enable them to see deliverance.</body></html>
