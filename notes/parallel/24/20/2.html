And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.">2Chronicles 16:10</a>), had ever before been subjected to an ignominious punishment such as this. It was so far analogous to the outrage against which St. Paul protested in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2-3</a>. The word "smote" implies a blow struck with the priest's own hands rather than the infliction of the legal punishment of forty stripes save one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm" title="Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>). The English word "stocks" expresses adequately enough the instrument of torture which, like the <span class= "ital">nervus </span>of Roman punishment, kept the body (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm" title="Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.">Acts 16:24</a>) in a crooked and painful position. The word here used occurs in the Hebrew of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-10.htm" title="Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.">2Chronicles 16:10</a>, as above, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm" title="The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, but the A. V. there renders it as "prison-house." In that humiliating position the prophet was left for the whole night in one of the most conspicuous places of the city, the temple-gate of Benjamin (the <span class= "ital">upper </span>gate) on the northern side of the inner court, probably the higher or northern gate of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm" title="Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.">Ezekiel 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.">Ezekiel 9:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Pashur, being charged with the police of the temple, smites Jeremiah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> causes stripes to be given him (a legal punishment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>), and then orders him to be put into <span class="cmt_word">the stocks</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that which distorts -</span> some instrument of punishment which held the body in a bent or crooked position (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>). The "stocks" were sometimes kept in a special house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-10.htm">2 Chronicles 16:10</a>); these mentioned here, however, apparently stood in public, at the high - or rather, upper - <span class="cmt_word">gate of Benjamin</span>, which was by - or, <span class="accented">at - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the house of the Lord</span>. The gate, then, was one of the temple gates, and is called "the upper" to distinguish it from one of the city gates which bore the same name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>). It is presumably the same which is called "the new gate of the Lord's house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>), as having been comparatively lately built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 Pashur smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks. Jeremiah was silent till God put a word into his mouth. To confirm this, Pashur has a name given him, Fear on every side. It speaks a man not only in distress, but in despair; not only in danger, but in fear on every side. The wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can make the most daring sinner a terror to himself. And those who will not hear of their faults from God's prophets, shall be made to hear them from their consciences. Miserable is the man thus made a terror to himself. His friends shall fail him. God lets him live miserably, that he may be a monument of Divine justice.</body></html>
