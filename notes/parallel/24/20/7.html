The narrative ends, and a psalm of passionate complaint begins. Its position probably indicates that the compiler of the prophecies in their present form looked on the complaints as belonging to this period of the prophet's work, representing the thoughts of that night of shame which was, as it were, the extremest point of apparent failure.

Now it is more dominant and continuous.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">thou hast laid hold on me. </span>Jehovah now appears to the prophet as a hard taskmaster who had forced him, against his will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-16.htm" title="As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow you: neither have I desired the woeful day; you know: that which came out of my lips was right before you.">Jeremiah 17:16</a>), to enter on a work from which he shrank, and who gave him scorn and derision as his only wage. He felt, in St. Paul's language, that "a necessity was laid upon" him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1Corinthians 9:16</a>); or in Isaiah's, that the "strong hand" of the Lord was on him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm" title="For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,">Isaiah 8:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Daily.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">all the day.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-13.</span> - A lyric passage, expressing the conflict in the prophet's mind owing to the mockery and the slander which his preaching has brought upon him, and at the same time his confidence of victory through the protection of Jehovah; a suitable sequel to the narrative which goes before, even if not originally written to occupy this position (see general Introduction). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast deceived me</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">thou didst entice me</span>, <span class="accented">and I let myself be enticed</span>. Jeremiah refers to the hesitation he originally felt to accepting the prophetic office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>.). The verb does not mean "to deceive," but "to entice" (so rendered in ver. 10, Authorized Version), or "allure." The same word is used in that remarkable narrative of "the spirit" who offered to "entice" (Authorized Version, to "persuade") Ahab to "go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-21.htm">1 Kings 22:21</a>). In Ezekiel, too, the same case is supposed as possible of Jehovah's "enticing" a prophet (Ezekiel 15:9). The expression implies that all events are, in some sense, caused by God, even those which are, or appear to be, injurious to the individual. Was Goethe thinking of this passage when he wrote the words, "Wen Gott betrugt, ist wohl be-trogon?" Applying the words in a Christian sense, we may say (with F. W. Robertson) that God teaches us by our illusions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou didst take hold on me</span>, <span class="accented">and didst prevail</span>. The expression is like "Jehovah spake thus to me with a grasp of the hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:7-13 The prophet complains of the insult and injury he experienced. But ver. 7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory. Let the people of God open their cause before Him, and he will enable them to see deliverance.</body></html>
