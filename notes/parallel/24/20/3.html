for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.">Jeremiah 6:25</a>. We may venture to think that the Psalm had been his comfort in those night-watches of suffering, and that he now uttered the words which described the bitterness of the Psalmist's sorrow, as at last feeling sure that they belonged to his persecutor rather than to himself. It is scarcely necessary to seek a special significance in the name of Pashur as contrasted with this new <span class= "ital">nomen et omen; </span>but Hebrew scholars, according to various, and it must be owned, conjectural etymologies, have found in it the ideas of wide-spread joy, "joy round about," or else of freedom and deliverance. The prophet repeats the combination in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-5.htm" title="Why have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 46:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm" title="Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Fear is on every side.">Jeremiah 49:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-22.htm" title="You have called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up has my enemy consumed.">Lamentations 2:22</a>, and it had evidently become a kind of "burden" in both senses of the word, weighing on the prophet's thoughts and finding frequent utterance. The word that stands for "fear" is a rare one, and outside the passages now referred to is found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-9.htm" title="And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, said the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.">Isaiah 31:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Symbolic change of name. <span class="cmt_word">Not... Pashur, but Magor-missabib</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> terror on every side. There is probably no allusion to the (by no means obvious) etymology of Pashur. Jeremiah simply means to say that Pashur would one day become an object of general horror (see on ver. 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 Pashur smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks. Jeremiah was silent till God put a word into his mouth. To confirm this, Pashur has a name given him, Fear on every side. It speaks a man not only in distress, but in despair; not only in danger, but in fear on every side. The wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can make the most daring sinner a terror to himself. And those who will not hear of their faults from God's prophets, shall be made to hear them from their consciences. Miserable is the man thus made a terror to himself. His friends shall fail him. God lets him live miserably, that he may be a monument of Divine justice.</body></html>
