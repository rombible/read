By some, indeed, it has been thought that we have here an accidental dislocation, and that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/20-14.htm" title="Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed.">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a> should stand before <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>. The prophet utters a cry of anguish yet keener than that which now precedes it, and borrows the language of that cry from the book of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm" title="Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.">Jeremiah 3:3</a>). The prophet turned in the depth of his suffering to the words in which the great representative of sufferers had <span class= "ital">"</span>cursed his day." The question whether we are to blame or to palliate such utterances, how far they harmonise with Christian feeling, is one on which we need not dwell long. It is enough to note (1) that, while we cannot make for them the half-evasive apology which sees in Jeremiah's prayers against his enemies, and in the imprecatory psalms, prophecies rather than prayers, they indicate the same temper as those psalms and prayers indicate when taken in their natural sense, and so help us to understand them; and (2) that in such cases, while we give thanks that we have the blessing of a higher law and the example of a higher life, we are not called upon to apportion praise or blame. It is enough to reverence, to sympathise, to be silent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-18.</span> - Jeremiah curses the day of his birth. The passage is a further development of the complaint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, and stands in no connection with the consolatory close of the preceding passage. There is a very striking parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-12</a>, and the question cannot be evaded, Which is the original? It is difficult to believe that Jeremiah copied from an earlier poem. Deep emotion expresses itself in language suggested by the moment; and, even after retouching his discourses, Jeremiah would leave much of the original expression. But impressions of this sort cannot be unreservedly trusted. The argument from parallel passages is only a subsidiary one in the determination of the date of books. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:14-18 When grace has the victory, it is good to be ashamed of our folly, to admire the goodness of God, and be warned to guard our spirits another time. See how strong the temptation was, over which the prophet got the victory by Divine assistance! He is angry that his first breath was not his last. While we remember that these wishes are not recorded for us to utter the like, we may learn good lessons from them. See how much those who think they stand, ought to take heed lest they fall, and to pray daily, Lead us not into temptation. How frail, changeable, and sinful is man! How foolish and unnatural are the thoughts and wishes of our hearts, when we yield to discontent! Let us consider Him who endured the contradiction of sinners against himself, lest we should be at any time weary and faint in our minds under our lesser trials.</body></html>
