They were on the look-out for some rash and hasty word spoken in prophetic zeal, and the prophet, in the bitterness of his soul, looked on their work and that of Jehovah as tending to the same result. Compare the conduct of the Scribes and Pharisees towards our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.">Matthew 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm" title="Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.">Matthew 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-13.htm" title="And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.">Mark 12:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I heard</span>, etc.; rather, For I <span class="accented">have heard the whispering of many</span>; <span class="accented">there is terror on every side</span>. <span class="accented">Inform</span> (<span class="accented">say they</span>), <span class="accented">and let us inform against him</span>. This gives us the reason for Ms momentary inclinations to silence. He was surrounded by bitter enemies, who were no longer content with malicious words, but urged each other on to lay an information against him with the authorities as a public criminal. The first clause agrees verbatim with part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a> (this is one of the psalms attributed, by a too bold conjecture, to Jeremiah). "There is terror on every side" (see above, ver. 3, and also note on Jeremiah 6:25) means "everything about me inspires me with terror." <span class="cmt_word">All my familiars is</span>, literally, <span class="accented">all the men of my peace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all those with whom I have been on terms of friendship (same phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Watched for my halting</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either laid traps for me or waited for me to commit some error for them to take advantage cf. The phrase, "my halting," is borrowed (?) from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a> (Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">He will be enticed</span>; viz. to say something on which a charge of treason can be based. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:7-13 The prophet complains of the insult and injury he experienced. But ver. 7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory. Let the people of God open their cause before Him, and he will enable them to see deliverance.</body></html>
