We may probably identify him with the father of the Gedaliah named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm" title="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 38:1</a> as among the "princes" that at a later date opposed the prophet's work, and with the section of the priesthood, the sixteenth, named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-14.htm" title="The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,">1Chronicles 24:14</a>, as headed in the time of David by Immer. The name here (like that of "the sons of Korah") may indicate simply the fact that he belonged to this section; or, possibly, the name of the patriarch (so to speak) who gave its name to it may have re-appeared from time to time in the line of his descendants. The name of Pashur appears again, after the Captivity, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/2-37.htm" title="The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.">Ezra 2:37-38</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Chief governor.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">deputy-governor. </span>The word for <span class= "ital">governor </span>is <span class= "ital">Nagid, </span>and this office was assigned to the high priest as the "ruler of the house of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;">1Chronicles 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm" title="And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.">2Chronicles 31:13</a>). In the case of Zephaniah, who appears as <span class= "ital">Nagid </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm" title="The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, it was given to him as the "second priest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2Kings 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-14.htm" title="And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.">Jeremiah 52:14</a>). Next in order to him was the <span class= "ital">Pakid, </span>the deputy, or, perhaps, better, <span class= "ital">superintendent. </span>Here Pashur is described by the combination of the two titles, possibly as implying that he was invested, though a "deputy," with the full powers of the "governor." By some commentators, however, the relation of the two words is inverted, the <span class= "ital">Nagid </span>being added to the <span class= "ital">Pakid, </span>to imply that Pashur was the chief warden or overseer. As such, on either view, the act and the words of Jeremiah came under his official notice. That such words should be spoken in the court of the Temple to the multitude assembled there was, we must believe, something new, and Pashur was resolved at any cost to prevent its repetition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 Pashur smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks. Jeremiah was silent till God put a word into his mouth. To confirm this, Pashur has a name given him, Fear on every side. It speaks a man not only in distress, but in despair; not only in danger, but in fear on every side. The wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can make the most daring sinner a terror to himself. And those who will not hear of their faults from God's prophets, shall be made to hear them from their consciences. Miserable is the man thus made a terror to himself. His friends shall fail him. God lets him live miserably, that he may be a monument of Divine justice.</body></html>
