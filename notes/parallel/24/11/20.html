As such it is not to be imitated by Christians, but neither is it to be hastily condemned. The appeal to a higher judge, the desire to leave vengeance in His hands, is in itself a victory over the impulse to take vengeance into our own hands. Through it, in most cases, the sufferer from wrong must pass before he can attain to the higher and more Christ-like temper which utters itself in the prayer, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Unto thee have I revealed my cause.</span>--i.e., laid it bare before thee. The thought and the phrase were characteristic of Jeremiah, and meet us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that try the righteous, and see the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I opened my cause.">Jeremiah 20:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - (Parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Unto thee have I revealed my cause.</span> This is the literal rendering, but a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>, suggests that the In meaning is Upon thee have I rolled my cause." This expression is certainly not only more forcible, but more appropriate than the other. Jeremiah's cause was not a secret which needed to be "revealed" <span class="accented">to</span> Jehovah, but a burden too heavy for so finely strung a nature to bear alone. Grammatically, the preferred meaning is quite justifiable, though less obvious, as there are other instances of an interchange of meanings between two classes of verbs (see on Jeremiah 33:6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:18-23 The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.</body></html>
