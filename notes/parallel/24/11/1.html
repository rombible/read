No date is given, and we are driven to infer it from the internal evidence of the message itself. This points to an early period of Jeremiah's work, probably in the reign of Josiah. The invasion of the Chaldeans is not so near, as in the preceding chapter. Jeremiah is still residing at Anathoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:">Jeremiah 11:21</a>). By some critics, however, it is referred to the reign of Jehoiachin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-10 God never promised to bestow blessings on his rational creatures, while they persist in wilful disobedience. Pardon and acceptance are promised freely to all believers; but no man can be saved who does not obey the command of God to repent, to believe in Christ, to separate from sin and the world, to choose self-denial and newness of life. In general, men will hearken to those who speak of doctrines, promises, and privileges; but when duties are mentioned, they will not bend their ear.</body></html>
