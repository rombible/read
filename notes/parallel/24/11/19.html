it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.">2Samuel 12:3</a>), brought up in the home of its master. There is no "or" in the Hebrew, and the translators seem to have mistaken the adjective (tame) for a noun. The LXX., Vulg., and Luther agree in the rendering now given. Assuming the earlier date of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>, the words would seem to have been an allusive reference to the sufferer there described.<p><span class= "bld">The tree with the fruit thereof.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the tree with its bread, </span>here taken for its "fruit." Some scholars, however, render the word "sap," or adopt a reading which gives that meaning. The phrase would seem to be proverbial for total destruction, not of the man only, but of his work. While the prophet's life had been innocent and unsuspecting, his own townsmen were conspiring to crush him, and bury his name and work in oblivion. The sufferings of the prophet present, in this matter, a parallel to those of the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-29.htm" title="And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill where on their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.">Luke 4:29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like a lamb or an ox</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a mild lamb</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> one of the old translations has it), equivalent <span class="accented">to quasi agaus mansuetus</span> (Vulgate). Jeremiah says that he was as unsuspicious as a tame lamb which has grown up with its master's family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-3.htm">2 Samuel 12:3</a>). The Arabs use the very same adjective in a slightly different form as an epithet of such tame lambs (Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 1:520-522, edit. 1663). It is impossible to help thinking of that "Servant of Jehovah," of whom Jeremiah was a type, who is said, in prophetic vision, to have been "brought as a lamb to the slaughter," and "not to have opened his mouth "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tree with the fruit thereof</span>; apparently a proverbial expression. Giving the words their ordinary meaning, the rendering would <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">the tree with its bread</span> (<span class="accented">b'lakhmo</span>). Our translators appear to have thought that the transition from "bread" to "fruit" was as justifiable in Hebrew as it is in Arabic (in which '<span class="accented">uklu</span> means properly "food" in general, but also "date fruit"). Fruit, however, was not such an important article of food with the Israelites as with the Arabs; and we must either, with Hitzig, suppose a letter to have intruded into the text, and render (from a corrected reading <span class="accented">b'lekho</span>), <span class="accented">with its sap</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, Hebrew), or else appeal to the etymology of <span class="accented">lekhem</span> (commonly "bread"), which is "firm, consistent," and render, the <span class="accented">tree with its pith</span> (Hence <span class="accented">lahmu</span> in Arabic means "flesh," and <span class="accented">luhmatu</span>, "a woof"). It is no credit to St. Jerome that he followed the absurd version of the Septuagint, "Let us put wood into his bread." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:18-23 The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.</body></html>
