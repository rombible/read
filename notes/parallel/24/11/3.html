<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-51.htm" title="For they be your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the middle of the furnace of iron:">1Kings 8:51</a>, "Hear my voice and do them" from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that the LORD your God will set you on high above all nations of the earth:">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>, "Ye shall be my people" from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-13.htm" title="That he may establish you to day for a people to himself, and that he may be to you a God, as he has said to you, and as he has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.">Deuteronomy 29:13</a>. The "iron furnace" was, of course, Egypt, the "furnace of affliction," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm" title="Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.">Isaiah 48:10</a>, in which the people had endured sufferings of which that was the only adequate symbol. The word used denoted the "furnace" of the smelter, but the actual form of bondage through which the Israelites had passed, working in the brick-kiln furnaces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm" title="And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.">Exodus 1:14</a>), had probably given a special force to the phrase.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Here begins a series of direct references to Deuteronomy, determining the date of the discourse. <span class="cmt_word">Cursed be the man</span>, etc.; alluding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a> (which has, however, not "obeyeth," but "confirmeth," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. ratifieth as his own personal rule of conduct. <span class="cmt_word">The words of this covenant</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the words of this ordinance</span>. The rendering "covenant," however, is not so much erroneous as unsuitable in this context; it is a secondary meaning of the Hebrew <span class="accented">b'rith</span>, the original sense being rather "authoritative appointment" (from <span class="accented">barah</span>, to cut, hence to decide). Nothing, perhaps, is so injurious to a correct understanding of the Scriptures as persistently rendering a Hebrew or Greek word by the same supposed equivalent. "Covenant" is no doubt appropriate in some passages (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>), because an "appointment" between men, if equals, involves "giving and taking;" but is inadequate when the parties are not equals, and most of all when the superior party is the Divine Being. In these cases we must clearly recur to the original meaning of" appointment" or "ordinance;" and we have one such case here (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-10.htm">Psalm 105:10</a>; but <span class="accented">not</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> (1, an arrangement; 2, a will or testament; 3, a covenant) is to some extent parallel (see Cremer's 'Biblico-Theological Lexicon of New Testament Greek,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-10 God never promised to bestow blessings on his rational creatures, while they persist in wilful disobedience. Pardon and acceptance are promised freely to all believers; but no man can be saved who does not obey the command of God to repent, to believe in Christ, to separate from sin and the world, to choose self-denial and newness of life. In general, men will hearken to those who speak of doctrines, promises, and privileges; but when duties are mentioned, they will not bend their ear.</body></html>
