This was what she was meant to be.<p><span class= "bld">Fair, and of goodly fruit.</span>--The words point, as before, to the ideal state of Israel. She had made no effort to attain that ideal, and therefore the thunderstorm of God's wrath fell on it. The word for "tumult" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm" title="And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:24</a> for the sound of an army on its march, and is probably used as combining the literal or figurative meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A green olive tree</span>. The olive tree is "one of the most thriving, hardy, and productive trees in the East" (it was the first tree elected king in the parable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>), and with its "foliage of a deep, perennial green," furnishes a striking symbol of healthful beauty. A psalmist, speaking in the character of the typical righteous man, compares himself to a "green olive tree in the house of God' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>). The word rendered "green "is one of those which are the despair of translators (see on Jeremiah 2:20). It gives a picture in itself. We seem to see a flourishing, sappy tree, with abundance of pliant, gracefully moving, perennially green branches. <span class="cmt_word">With the noise of a great tumult.</span> Either the tumult of the <span class="accented">melee</span> of battle is meant (the same uncommon word is used with such a reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>) or the crashing of thunder. "With a rushing mighty sound" would be a more forcible rendering. (For the concluding figure, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He hath kindled fire</span>, etc. There is no occasion to explain this as merely the perfect of prophetic certitude. It was literally true that the fire of war had already devastated the fairest portion of the Holy Land. Israel (expressly referred to in Ver. 17) had already been carried into captivity, and Judah was, to the prophetic eye, as good as destroyed. Here, no doubt, that wonderful perfect of faith does come in. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:11-17 Evil pursues sinners, and entangles them in snares, out of which they cannot free themselves. Now, in their distress, their many gods and many altars stand them in no stead. And those whose own prayers will not be heard, cannot expect benefit from the prayers of others. Their profession of religion shall prove of no use. When trouble came upon them, they made this their confidence, but God has rejected it. His altar shall yield them no satisfaction. The remembrance of God's former favours to them shall be no comfort under troubles; and his remembrance of them shall be no argument for their relief. Every sin against the Lord is a sin against ourselves, and so it will be found sooner or later.</body></html>
