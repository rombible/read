The number of places named (the three appear in the same combination in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-14.htm" title="Declare you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say you, Stand fast, and prepare you; for the sword shall devour round about you.">Jeremiah 46:14</a>) indicates the extent of the emigration. Migdol (here, as elsewhere, meaning a "tower" or "fortress") is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall you encamp by the sea.">Exodus 14:2</a> as on the route of the Israelites before they crossed the Red Sea, between Pi-hahiroth and Baal-zephon, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-10.htm" title="Behold, therefore I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even to the border of Ethiopia.">Ezekiel 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 30:6</a>. It appears in the <span class= "ital">Itinerary </span>of Antoninus, under the name <span class= "ital">Magdolo, </span>as twelve miles south of Pelusium. The latter is thought by Lepsius to be different from the former, and to answer to the <span class= "ital">Stratopeda </span>or "camp" which Herodotus mentions as having been founded by Psammetichus I. as a settlement for his Ionian or Carian mercenaries (Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible, </span>Art. <span class= "ital">Migdol</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Noph was identical with Memphis, and appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-13.htm" title="The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.">Isaiah 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm" title="Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of your head.">Jeremiah 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-16.htm" title="And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.">Ezekiel 30:16</a> : and as Moph in the Hebrew of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm" title="For, see, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.">Hosea 9:6</a>. The position of Pathros is less certain, but it may be inferred from the mention of the other cities with it that it was in Lower Egypt, and possibly, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm" title="Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelled in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,">Jeremiah 44:15</a>, that it was the name of the region in which it was situated. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>, it appears in conjunction with Mizraim (= Egypt) and Cush (= Ethiopia), both of which are names of regions and not of cities. By Brugsch (<span class= "ital">Egypt, </span>I. 242) it has been identified with Upper Egypt, the region of the Thebaid. There is no certain note of the interval between the arrival of the Jews in Egypt and the delivery of the discourse, but it would appear that there had been time for the Jews to disperse and settle in the three or four cities here named, and to adopt the worship of the Egyptians. It is, however, implied throughout that the prophet is speaking to the emigrants themselves, and not to their descendants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-21.htm" title="The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?">Jeremiah 44:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - Accusation brought against the obstinately idolatrous people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which dwell;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which dwelt.</span> It appears from this verse that the Jewish fugitives had separated in Egypt, some going to the two northern frontier cities, Migdol (on which see R.S.

It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us. The most awful miseries to which men are exposed, are occasioned by the neglect of offered salvation.</body></html>
