but you would not hear, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 29:19</a>). The term "abominable thing," or "abomination," though common in many of the books of the Old Testament, as in the Proverbs, where it is applied to moral enormities (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-32.htm" title="For the fraudulent is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.">Proverbs 3:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm" title="These six things does the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him:">Proverbs 6:16</a>), is specially characteristic, as applied to idolatry, of Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm" title="Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place.

It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us. The most awful miseries to which men are exposed, are occasioned by the neglect of offered salvation.</body></html>
