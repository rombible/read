The new sin would lead to a new punishment. A tone of irony is perceptible in the words, "Ye will surely accomplish your vows." That, at all events, was a promise they were likely to keep, however faithless they might have shown themselves in keeping their vows to the God of their fathers. But the Lord of Israel meets that vow by another. By that "great name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>) of the Lord God (<span class= "ital">Jehovah Adonai</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which they had slighted and profaned, He declares that it shall be profaned no more by the Egyptian exiles, not because they, of their own accord, would cease to use it, but because none of them should be left there. The small remnant that survived the sword and the famine should return to Judah as a witness of the judgment that had fallen on them, and of the truth of the prophet's warning. The words of Jehovah should stand, while those of men should fail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:20-30 Whatever evil comes upon us, it is because we have sinned against the Lord; we should therefore stand in awe, and sin not. Since they were determined to persist in their idolatry, God would go on to punish them. What little remains of religion were among them, would be lost. The creature-comforts and confidences from which we promise ourselves most, may fail as soon as those from which we promise ourselves least; and all are what God makes them, not what we fancy them to be. Well-grounded hopes of our having a part in the Divine mercy, are always united with repentance and obedience.</body></html>
