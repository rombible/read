Of the names themselves, the prominent idea in "prophet" is that of full-flowing utterance; in "diviners," that of casting lots, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; in "dreamers," what the English word indicates; in enchanters, that of practising "veiled" or "secret" arts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm" title="You shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall you use enchantment, nor observe times.">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>); in "sorcerers," that of muttered and whispered spells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/47-9.htm" title="But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come on you in their perfection for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great abundance of your enchantments.">Isaiah 47:9-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?">2Kings 9:22</a>). It is clear that the five nations of the confederacy were sustained in their rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar by a unanimity of prediction from men of all these classes like that which lured Ahab to his destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, With which? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You shall persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.">1Kings 22:22</a>). Every oracle was tuned, as it were, in favour of the policy of resistance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your dreamers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your dreams</span>. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a> the "dreams" of the people are expressly distinguished from the utterances of the prophets and soothsayers. In our passage the "dreamers" are appropriately mentioned between the "diviners" and the "enchanters," because the skill of the soothsayers partly lay in the interpretation of dreams (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 Jeremiah is to prepare a sign that all the neighbouring countries would be made subject to the king of Babylon. God asserts his right to dispose of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of the good things of this world, it is what God sees fit to give; we should therefore be content. The things of this world are not the best things, for the Lord often gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is not founded in grace. Those who will not serve the God who made them, shall justly be made to serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiah urges them to prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit, by quiet submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the best of what is bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, by submitting to humbling providences. It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor in spirit, the meek and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries to which the high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be our interest to obey God's will.</body></html>
