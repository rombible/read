and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.">Jeremiah 25:11</a>. The use of the phrase, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm" title="Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, to the third and to the fourth generation.">Exodus 34:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-25.htm" title="When you shall beget children, and children's children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:">Deuteronomy 4:25</a>, points rather to an undefined prolongation, subject only to the fact that there was an appointed limit. Historically we may note the fact that Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his son, Evil-merodach (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>); he by his brother-in-law, Neriglissar, and he by Nabouahid and his son Belshazzar. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Shall serve themselves of him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">shall make him to serve. </span>It lies in the nature of the case that the pronoun refers to the King of Babylon for the time being. The confederacy of nations which shall overthrow the Babylonian monarchy, Medes and others, is described more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm" title="Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27-28</a>. The words were clearly meant to point both ways. They warn the nations not to resist the Chaldaean king then. They warn the king not to think that he is founding a dynasty of long duration. The whole verse is wanting in the LXX., perhaps because they imagined that the "son's son" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm" title="And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.">Jeremiah 27:7</a> was inconsistent with the facts of history, as they read them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him, and his son, and his son's son</span>. This is intelligible only if the seventy years predicted by Jeremiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12, 29</a>:10, are a round number. Nebuchadnezzar died in <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, and was succeeded by his son Evil-Merodach, who, after two years, was put to death by Neriglissar. In <span class="date">B.C. 555</span> Laberosoarchod (?) became king, but after nine months a usurper belonging to another family, Nabonedus or Nabunita, ascended the throne, which he occupied till <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, the year of the fall of Babylon. "Seventy years," taken literally, only brings us to <span class="date">B.C. 555</span>, seventeen years short of the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus. <span class="cmt_word">Until the very time of his land come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">until the time of his own land</span> come. Nebuchadnezzar cannot ensure his realm against captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Shall serve themselves of him</span> (For the meaning of the phrase, see on Jeremiah 25:14.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 Jeremiah is to prepare a sign that all the neighbouring countries would be made subject to the king of Babylon. God asserts his right to dispose of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of the good things of this world, it is what God sees fit to give; we should therefore be content. The things of this world are not the best things, for the Lord often gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is not founded in grace. Those who will not serve the God who made them, shall justly be made to serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiah urges them to prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit, by quiet submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the best of what is bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, by submitting to humbling providences. It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor in spirit, the meek and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries to which the high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be our interest to obey God's will.</body></html>
