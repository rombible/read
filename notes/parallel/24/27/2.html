And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>). We have to realise the infinitely more vivid impression which the appearance of the prophet in this strange guise, as though he were at once a captive slave and a beast of burden, would make on the minds of men, as compared with simply warning them of a coming subjugation. The principle on which the prophet acted was that of Horace (<span class= "ital">Ep. ad Pis. </span>180):--<p>"<span class= "ital">Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures,<p>Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quae<p>Ipse sibi tradit spectator."</span><p>"Things that we hear less stir the inmost soul,<p>Than what the eye sees dramatised in act."<p>So Agabus bound himself with Paul's girdle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>). So Ezekiel dug through the wall of his house and carried out his stuff (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/12-5.htm" title="Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.">Ezekiel 12:5-7</a>). We find from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm" title="Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.">Jeremiah 28:10</a> that the prophet obeyed the command quite literally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make thee bends and yokes</span>; rather, bands <span class="accented">and poles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bands which secured the two pieces of wood placed respectively above and beneath the neck of the ox, so forming a yoke. Hence, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, we find the phrase, "the poles [Authorized Version wrongly, 'the bands'] of your yoke." It is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10</a> that this account is to be taken literally. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 Jeremiah is to prepare a sign that all the neighbouring countries would be made subject to the king of Babylon. God asserts his right to dispose of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of the good things of this world, it is what God sees fit to give; we should therefore be content. The things of this world are not the best things, for the Lord often gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is not founded in grace. Those who will not serve the God who made them, shall justly be made to serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiah urges them to prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit, by quiet submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the best of what is bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, by submitting to humbling providences. It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor in spirit, the meek and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries to which the high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be our interest to obey God's will.</body></html>
