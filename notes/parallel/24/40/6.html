for he said, The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.">Genesis 31:49</a>), was naturally not uncommon. Of the six or seven cities that were so called, that which comes before us here was Mizpah of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25-26</a>), prominent in the history of Samuel and Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/7-5.htm" title="And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:5-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1Samuel 10:17-25</a>), not far from Gibeah of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-29.htm" title="They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.">Isaiah 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm" title="And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.">Judges 19:13</a>). It has been identified by Dr. Robinson (B<span class= "ital">ibl. Res. </span>i. 460) with <span class= "ital">Neby-Samwil, </span>about six miles north of Jerusalem. Dean Stanley, Mr. Grove, and Dr. Bonar, however, find it in the ridge which forms a continuation of the Mount of Olives on the north, and which Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 2), apparently giving the Greek equivalent of the old Hebrew name, calls <span class= "ital">Skopos, </span>or "the watch-tower." Mizpah, it may be noted, is twice translated <span class= "ital">Skopia </span>in the LXX. version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-1.htm" title="Hear you this, O priests; and listen, you house of Israel; and give you ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.">Hosea 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-3.htm" title="And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.">1Samuel 22:3</a>).

Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others, who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But, sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself; but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the king of Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in this decision. But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the good of the church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances, and they will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most secure situations without it.</body></html>
