On parting with him he treats him as an honoured guest, sends him a portion of food from his own table (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-34.htm" title="And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.">Jeremiah 52:34</a>)--a welcome gift, doubtless, after the privations of the siege--and an <span class= "ital">honorarium, </span>in money as a compensation for the sufferings he had undergone as a preacher of submission to the conqueror.<p><span class= "bld">Governor over the cities of Judah.</span>--The official title is significant. Jerusalem is treated as if it had been blotted from the face of the earth, and required no superintendence. Gedaliah, the prophet's friend, had obviously acted on his counsels, and accepted the sovereignty of Nebuchadnezzar as being for the time the ordinance of God.

Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others, who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But, sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself; but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the king of Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in this decision. But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the good of the church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances, and they will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most secure situations without it.</body></html>
