It is a natural conclusion that it stands as a kind of heading to the section of the collected prophecies subsequent to the capture of the city.<p><span class= "bld">Had let him go from Ramah.</span>--The town so named was in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25</a>), about six miles from Jerusalem, and retains its old name in the form <span class= "ital">Er-Ram. </span>It was used on this occasion as a depot for the prisoners who were brought to it from Jerusalem, to await the orders of Nebuzaradan as to their ultimate disposal. The captain of the guard and the prophet had apparently not met before, and the latter had been brought in chains (literally, <span class= "ital">manacles, </span>chains fastened to the wrists, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-4.htm" title="And now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which were on your hand. If it seem good to you to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well to you: but if it seem ill to you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before you: where it seems good and convenient for you to go, thither go.">Jeremiah 40:4</a>), like the other captives.<p>(2?4) <span class= "bld">The Lord thy God . . .</span>--It is significant that the Chaldaean general speaks as if recognising Jehovah as the God of Israel, and the prophet's mission from Him. Such a recognition did not, however, imply more than the belief of the polytheist, that each nation had its own guardian deity. We find language of a like kind, though spoken with a tone of sarcasm, coming even from the lips of Rab-shakeh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-25.htm" title="Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.">2Kings 18:25</a>). As a prophet, however, Jeremiah is treated with marked respect--in part, perhaps, due to the policy he had advocated; in part, possibly, to the influence of men like Daniel and his friends at Babylon--and offered the option of going, with the promise of honourable treatment. to that city, from which, however, it is assumed, that he would not return, or remaining in Judaea, to <span class= "ital">go </span>where he will. The prophet obviously chooses the second alternative, but before he acts on it another plan occurs to Nebuzar-adan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - The liberation of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word that came to Jeremiah.</span> The formula seems to announce a prophecy; but no prophecy follows. It is not allowable to suppose, with Keil and others, that "the word" describes the entire body of prophetic utterance in ch. 40-45. (in spite of the fact that ch. 44. and 45. have special headings). The use would be unexampled; and a prologue of forty verses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>) is equally contrary to prophetic analogy. Apparently the "word," or prophecy, which originally followed the heading has been lost or removed to some other place. <span class="cmt_word">Had let him go from Ramah.</span> Here is an apparent discrepancy with the account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>. The brevity of the latter seems to account for it. No doubt the more precise statement in our passage is to be followed. After the capture of the city, a number of captives, including Jeremiah, were probably conducted to Ramah (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), where they had to wait for the royal decision as to their fate. Jeremiah, however, had already been in custody in the "court of the watch," and the writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a> simply omits the second stage of his captivity (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">In chains.</span> See ver. 4, "The chains which were upon thine hand." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-6 The captain of the guard seems to glory that he had been God's instrument to fulfil, what Jeremiah had been God's messenger to foretell. Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others, who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But, sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself; but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the king of Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in this decision. But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the good of the church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances, and they will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most secure situations without it.</body></html>
