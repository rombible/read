the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>), and its northern walls were in that of Benjamin. It was natural that the prophet of Anathoth should think and speak of it as connected with his own people.<p><span class= "bld">Blow the trumpet in Tekoa.</span>--i.e., "give the signal for the fugitives to halt, but not till they have reached the southernmost boundary of Judah." Tekoa was about twelve miles south of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm" title="He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,">2Chronicles 11:6</a>). The Hebrew presents a play upon the name Tekoa, as nearly identical with its sound is the verb "blow," and the town is probably mentioned for that reason. The play upon the name is analogous to those that meet us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.">Micah 1:10-16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Sign of fire.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">signal. </span>The word, though applied to a fire or smoke signal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm" title="Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.">Judges 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm" title="But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.">Judges 20:40</a>, does not necessarily imply it. Such signals were, however, in common use in all ancient warfare.<p><span class= "bld">Beth-haccerem.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., the house of the vineyard, </span>halfway on the road from Jerusalem to Tekoa. There, too, the signal was to be raised that the fugitives might gather round it. Jerome states (Comm. on Jeremiah 6) that it was on a mountain, and was known in his time as Bethacharma. It has been identified with the modern <span class= "ital">Jebel Fureidis, </span>or "Hill of the Franks."<p><span class= "bld">Evil appeareth out of the north.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">is bending over us, </span>as looking down on its prey.

The political rank of Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, makes it difficult to realize that Jerusalem was not locally a city of Judah at all. It belonged, strictly speaking, to the tribe of Benjamin, a tribe whose insignificance, in comparison with Judah, seems to have led to the adoption of a form of expression not literally accurate (see Psalm 128:68). The true state of the case is evident from an examination of the two parallel passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7, 8</a>, and Joshua 18:16, 17. As Mr. Fergusson points out, "The boundary between Judah and Benjamin... ran at the foot of the hill on which the city stands, so that the city itself was actually in Benjamin, while, by crossing the narrow ravine of Hinnom, you set foot on the territory of Judah" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:983). It is merely a specimen of the unnatural method of early harmonists when Jewish writers tell us that the altars and the sanctuary were in Benjamin, and the courts of the temple in Judah. The words of "<span class="accented">the</span> blessing of Moses" are clear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>): "The beloved of the Lord! he shall dwell in safety by him, sheltering him continually, and between his shoulders he dwelleth;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Benjamin is specially protected, the sanctuary being on Benjamite soil. And yet these highly favored "children of Benjamin" are divinely warned to flee from their sacred homes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gather yourselves to flee</span>; more strictly, <span class="accented">save your goods by flight</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a> the same advice was given to the inhabitants of the country districts. There, Jerusalem was represented as the only safe refuge; here, the capital being no longer tenable, the wild pasture-land to the south (the foe being expected from the north) becomes the goal of the fugitives of <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>In Tokoa</span>. Tokoa was a town in the wild hill-county to the south of Judah, the birthplace of the prophet Amos. It is partly mentioned because its name seems to connect it with the verb rendered <span class="cmt_word">blow the trumpet</span>. Such paronomasiae are favorite oratorical instruments of the prophets, and especially in connections like the present (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A sign of fire in Beth-hakkerem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a signal on Beth-hakkerem</span>. The rendering of Authorized Version was suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38, 40</a>; but there is nothing in the present context (as there is in that passage) to favor the view that a fiery beacon is intended. Beth-hakkerem lay, according to St. Jerome, on an eminence between Jerusalem and Tekoa; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably the hill known as the Frank Mountain, the Arabic name of which (<span class="accented">Djebel el-Furaidis</span>, Little Paradise Mountain) is a not unsuitable equivalent for the Hebrew (Vineyard-house). The "district of Beth-hakkerem" is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Nehemiah 3:14</a>. The choice of the locality for the signal was a perfect one. "There is no other tell," remarks Dr. Thomson, "of equal height and size in Palestine." <span class="cmt_word">Appeareth</span>; <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">bendeth forward</span>, as if it were ready to fall. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Whatever methods are used, it is vain to contend with God's judgments. The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance and reformation, they may prevent things from coming to extremity.</body></html>
