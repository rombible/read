Even Judah shall undergo a severe sifting process, which is likened to a gleaning (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>).

If the text is correct, the speaker here addresses the leader of the gleaners. Keil thinks this change of construction is to emphasize the certainty of the predicted destruction. But it is much more natural (and in perfect harmony with many other similar phenomena of the received text) to suppose, with Hitzig, that the letter represented in the Authorized Version By "thine" has arisen by a mistaken repetition of the first letter of the following word, and (the verbal form being the same for the infinitive and the imperative) to render <span class="accented">turning again the hand</span>. In this case the clause will be dependent on the preceding statement as to the "gleaning" of Judah. <span class="cmt_word">Into the baskets</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto the shoots</span>. The gleaners will do their work with a stern thoroughness, laying the hand of destruction again and again upon the vine-shoots. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-17 When the Lord arises to take vengeance, no sinners of any age or rank, or of either sex escape. They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.</body></html>
