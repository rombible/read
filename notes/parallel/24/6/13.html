What the prophet condemns is the universal desire of gain (<span class= "ital">rem<span class= "bld"> . . .</span> rem<span class= "bld"> . . .</span></span> <span class= "ital">quocunque modo rem</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>sure to lead, as in the second clause, to a gratification of it by fair means or foul.<p><span class= "bld">From the prophet even unto the priest . . .</span>--The two orders that ought to have checked the evil are noted as having been foremost in promoting it. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-31.htm" title="The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end thereof?">Jeremiah 5:31</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Dealeth falsely.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">worketh a lie, </span>in the sense of "dishonesty."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Given to covetousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">gaineth gain</span>; but the word here rendered "gain" implies that it is unrighteous gain (the root means "to tear"), Unjust gain and murder are repeatedly singled out in the Old Testament as representative sins (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-36.htm">Psalm 119:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>; and see my note on Isaiah 57:17). There is a special reason for the selection of "covetousness" here. Land was the object of a high-born Jew's ambition, and expulsion from his land was his appropriate punishment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-17 When the Lord arises to take vengeance, no sinners of any age or rank, or of either sex escape. They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.</body></html>
