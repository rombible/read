Is it not well that they should stop and ask where the old paths (literally, <span class= "ital">the eternal paths; </span>the words going, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm" title="Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;">Jeremiah 18:15</a>, beyond the mere antiquity of the nation's life) were, on which their fathers had travelled safely. Of these old paths they were to choose that which was most distinctly "the good way," the way of righteousness, and therefore of peace and health also. The call, however, was in vain. The people chose to travel still in the broad way that led them to destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-21.</span> - Without hearty repentance, there is no hope of escape.

There (as the following words state) the Jews are to make inquiry as to <span class="cmt_word">the old paths</span>. Antiquity gives a presumption of rightness; the ancients were nearer to the days when God spoke with man; they had the guidance of God's two mighty "shepherds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>); they knew, far better than we, who "are but of yesterday, and know nothing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-9.htm">Job 8:9</a>), the way of happiness. For though there are many pretended "ways," there is but "one way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a>) which has Jehovah's blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8, 9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-17 When the Lord arises to take vengeance, no sinners of any age or rank, or of either sex escape. They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.</body></html>
