The text has "pour it out." The sudden transition to the imperative is certainly harsh, and excuses the <span class="accented">conjectural emendation</span> which underlies the rendering of the Authorized Version. If we retain the imperative, we must explain it with reference to Jeremiah's inner experience. There are, we must remember, two selves in the prophet (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>), and the higher prophetic self here addresses the lower or human self, and calls upon it no longer to withhold the divinely communicated burden.

They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.</body></html>
