The clause is, however, rendered by some scholars as <span class= "ital">the fair and delicate one </span>(or, <span class= "ital">the fair pasturage</span>)<span class= "ital">, the daughter of Zion, I have destroyed.</span><span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- I have likened... a comely and delicate woman</span>. This passage is one of the most difficult in the book, and if there is corruption of the text anywhere, it is here. The most generally adopted rendering is, "The comely and delicate one will I destroy, even the daughter of Zion," giving the verb the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a> (literally it is, <span class="accented">I have brought to silence</span>, or perfect of prophetic certitude). The context, however, seems to favor the rendering "pasturage" (including the idea of a nomad settlement), instead of "comely;" but how to make this fit in with the remainder of the existing text is far from clear. The true and original reading probably only survives in fragments. Ver. 3 - <span class="cmt_word">The shepherds with their flocks</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">To her came shepherds with their flocks</span>; <span class="accented">they have pitched their tents round about her</span>; <span class="accented">they have pastured each at his side</span>. The best commentary on the last clause is furnished by <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>, "Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Whatever methods are used, it is vain to contend with God's judgments. The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance and reformation, they may prevent things from coming to extremity.</body></html>
