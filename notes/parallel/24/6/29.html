The founder in the case supposed went on with his work till the lead was melted, but he found no silver after all.<p><span class= "bld">Plucked away.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">separated </span>or <span class= "ital">purified, </span>as in keeping with the metaphor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bellows are burned</span>. The objection to this rendering is that the burning of the bellows would involve the interruption of the process of assaying. We might, indeed, translate "are scorched" (on the authority of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>), and attach the word rendered "of the fire" to the first clause; the half-verse would then run: "The bellows are scorched through the fire; the lead is consumed," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the bellows are even scorched through the heat of the furnace, and the lead has become entirely oxydized. But this requires us to alter the verb from the masculine to the feminine form of third sing. perf. (reading <span class="accented">tammah</span>). It is better, therefore, to give the verb (which will be Kal, if the <span class="accented">nun</span> be radical) the sense of "snorting," which it has in Aramaic and in Arabic, and which the corresponding noun has in Hebrew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>). The masculine form of the verb rendered "is consumed" is still a difficulty; but we have a better right to suppose that the first letter of <span class="accented">tittom</span> was dropped, owing to its identity with the second letter, than to append (as the first view would require us) an entirely different letter at the end. This being done, the whole passage becomes clear: "The bellows puff, (that) the lead may be consumed of the fire." In any case, the general meaning is obvious. The assayer has spared no trouble, all the rules of his art have been obeyed, but no silver appears as the result of the process. Lead is mentioned, because, before quicksilver was known, it was employed as a flux in the operation of smelting, <span class="cmt_word">Plucked away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">separated</span>, like the dross from the silver. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:18-30 God rejects their outward services, as worthless to atone for their sins. Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.</body></html>
