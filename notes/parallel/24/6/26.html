The ordinary sign of mourning was to sprinkle dust or ashes on the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm" title="It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.">2Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm" title="And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.">2Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-6.htm" title="And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.">Joshua 7:6</a>). This, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm" title="Howl, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, you principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and you shall fall like a pleasant vessel.">Jeremiah 25:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.">Micah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm" title="And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes.">Job 2:8</a>, indicated more utter wretchedness and prostration. The English verb belongs to the class of those which were once used reflexively, and have now come to be intransitive. "Endeavour" supplies another example.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wallow thyself in ashes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sprinkle thyself with ashes</span>, a sign of mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mourning, as for an only son.</span> The Septuagint renders <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>, where in like manner the Septuagint renders, not "thine only son," but "thy beloved son"). Possibly this was to avoid a supposition which might have occurred to some readers (it has, in fact, occurred to several modern critics) that the "only son" was Adonis, who was certainly "mourned for" by some of the Israelites under the name of Thammuz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), and whose Phoenician name is given by Philo of Byblus as <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably <span class="accented">Yakhidh</span>, only begotten, the word used by Jeremiah; comp. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;</span>, equivalent to Berith). M. Renan found a vestige of the ancient festival of Adonis at Djebeil (the Phoenician Gebal) even at the present day. There would be nothing singular in the adoption of a common popular phrase by the prophet, in spite of its reference to a heathen custom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>), and the view in question gives additional force to the passage. But the ordinary explanation is perfectly tenable and more obvious. The phrase, "mourning [or, 'lamentation'] for an only begotten one," occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. In the last-mentioned passage it is parallel with "bitter weeping for a firstborn." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:18-30 God rejects their outward services, as worthless to atone for their sins. Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.</body></html>
