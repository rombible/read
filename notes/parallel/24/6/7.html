It has been rendered, <span class= "ital">As a cistern </span>"<span class= "ital">gathers" </span>or "<span class= "ital">keeps in," </span>or "<span class= "ital">keeps its waters cool," </span>or "<span class= "ital">lets them flow." </span>The general meaning is probably given by the Authorised Version. Jerusalem was literally "overflowing" with wickedness.<p><span class= "bld">Grief.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">sickness. </span>The word and the imagery are the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm" title="Why should you be stricken any more? you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.">Isaiah 1:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a fountain casteth out</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a cistern keepeth fresh</span> (literally, cool). The wickedness of Jerusalem is so thoroughly ingrained that it seems to pass into act by a law of nature, just as a cistern cannot help always yielding a supply of cool, fresh water. <span class="cmt_word">Violence and spoil</span>; rather, <span class="accented">injustice and violence</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before me</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">before my face continually is sickness and wounding</span>. The ear is constantly dinned with the sounds of oppression, and the eye pained with the sight of the bodily sufferings of the victims. The word for" sickness" is applicable to any kind of infirmity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3, 4</a>), but the context clearly limits it here to bodily trouble. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Whatever methods are used, it is vain to contend with God's judgments. The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full.
