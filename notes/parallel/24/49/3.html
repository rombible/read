Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.">Jeremiah 48:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm" title="They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the middle of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, as connected with the fortunes of Moab, but it was strictly an Ammonite city.

The word is never used for the walls of a city, but appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-24.htm" title="But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.">Numbers 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-16.htm" title="And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:">Numbers 32:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-24.htm" title="Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.">Numbers 32:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-36.htm" title="And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.">Numbers 32:36</a> in the sense of "sheep-folds."<p><span class= "bld">Their king shall go into captivity.</span>--Better, as before, <span class= "ital">Melcom. </span>As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm" title="For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, the captivity of the national deity with his priests (the fact that they are named is decisive as to the meaning) involves the captivity of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heshbon</span>. Here mentioned as <span class="accented">de jure</span> a Gadite, but <span class="accented">de facto</span> an Ammonitish, town; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a> it appears as "the city of Sihon" the Amorite. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a> and Isaiah 16:9 it is reckoned to the Moabites. There was a continual warfare between the neigh-bouring tribes of Reuben and Gad on the one hand, and the Moabites and Ammonites on the other. Let Heshbon lament, because <span class="cmt_word">Ai is spoiled</span>. The introduction of At, which is only known to us as a Canaanitish town, near Bethel, on the wrong side of the Jordan for Moab, is startling. It is replied that we have no list of the Ammonitish cities, and that there may have been another town named At. The reply is valid; but loaves a second difficulty untouched, viz. that the mention of a third place destroys the continuity of thought. First, we are made acquainted with the fall of Rabbah; then Heshbon (probably the second place in the country) is called upon to wail because <span class="accented">x</span> has been taken by storm; then the populations of the "daughter" cities are summoned to join in the lamentation over Rabbah; - is it not reasonable to conclude that the subject of the mourning is one and the same? Now, it is well known that the received text abounds in small errors arising from the confusion of similar Hebrew letters, and that among the letters most easily confounded are <span class="accented">yod</span> and <span class="accented">resh.</span> Is it not an obvious conclusion that for Ai we should rather read Ar ("the city"), a name as suitable for the capital of Ammon as for that of Moab? It is true that we have no example elsewhere of Rabbah being called by the name of Ar; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3, 14</a> it is described as "the city," and we have to be on our guard against the argument <span class="accented">a silentio</span> - that favourite weapon of destructive criticism! Since a conjecture must be made, it is more respectful to the prophet to choose the one which is most suitable to the context. <span class="cmt_word">Daughters of Rabbah;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unwalled towns (as in ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">Run to and fro by the hedges;</span> rather, <span class="accented">by the enclosures</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wander about in the open country, seeking a lodging place in the enclosures of the sheepfolds (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-24.htm">Numbers 32:24</a>, Hebrew) or the vineyards (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>, Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">Their king</span>; or, <span class="accented">Milcom</span> (see on ver. 1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:1-6. Might often prevails against right among men, yet that might shall be controlled by the Almighty, who judges aright; and those will find themselves mistaken, who, like the Ammonites, think every thing their own on which they can lay their hands. The Lord will call men to account for every instance of dishonesty, especially to the destitute.</body></html>
