The "four winds" whirling round as in a <span class= "ital">cyclone </span>are to be the instruments of destruction.

In reading the Divine assurance of the destruction of all the enemies of the church, the believer sees that the issue of the holy war is not doubtful. It is blessed to recollect, that He who is for us, is more than all against us. And he will subdue the enemies of our souls.</body></html>
