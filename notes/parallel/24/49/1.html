They had been conquered by Sihon, the great Amorite king, and when that monarch was, in his turn, conquered by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-21.htm" title="And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,">Numbers 21:21-31</a>) their territory was assigned to the tribes of Gad and Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34-38</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/11-12.htm" title="And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?">Judges 11:12-33</a> we have the record of an unsuccessful attempt to recover their lost territory, and like attempts appear to have been made by Nahash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/11-1.htm" title="Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.">1Samuel 11:1-11</a>), and Hanun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/10-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.">2Samuel 10:6-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-26.htm" title="And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.">2Samuel 12:26-31</a>). On the deportation of the Trans-jordanic tribes by Tiglath-pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-6.htm" title="Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.">1Chronicles 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>), they made a more successful effort, and their king Baalis appears as prompting the conspiracy of Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-14.htm" title="And said to him, Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay you? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.">Jeremiah 40:14</a>). The prophecy on which we now enter was probably delivered before that time, in or about the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-21.htm" title="Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,">Jeremiah 25:21</a>). Its opening words recall the long-standing territorial controversy. "Had Israel no heir?" Was the land he had occupied so long to pass into the possession of a stranger?<p><span class= "bld">Why then doth their king inherit Gad . . .?</span>--Better, with the margin and all the older versions, <span class= "ital">Melcom. </span>The name, all but identical with the "Malcham" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and connected with Moloch, was that of the god of the Ammonites, as Chemosh was that of the Moabite deity. He, as his very name implied, was their true king; and the complaint of the prophet is that he inherits Gad, which had been in the possession of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - The violence of the Ammonites shall be severely punished. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath Israel no sons!</span> The violent seizure, perpetrated before his eyes, of parts of the sacred territory, forces the indignant question from the prophet, "How can these things be?" It was so on a former occasion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>), and it is so again, now that the Ammonites are occupying the land of the Gadites. True, the present generation has lost its property, but the next is the heir to all its rights and privileges. <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">their King</span> - their Melech or Moloch; it is the heavenly, not the earthly king who is referred to (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, however, read <span class="accented">Milcom</span>, which was the name of the Ammonite deity; this is only a different vocalizing of the consonants of the text. The actual vowel points give "malcam." This reading may, of course, be interpreted of the <span class="accented">earthly</span> king of the Ammonites. But this view ignores the obvious parallelism of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, "Chemosh shall go forth into captivity." <span class="cmt_word">Inherit</span>. The primary meaning of the word is "to take possession of, especially by force, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-6.htm">1 Kings 21:6</a>" (Gesenius, <span class="accented">ad voc</span>.), and this is the sense evidently required here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:1-6. Might often prevails against right among men, yet that might shall be controlled by the Almighty, who judges aright; and those will find themselves mistaken, who, like the Ammonites, think every thing their own on which they can lay their hands. The Lord will call men to account for every instance of dishonesty, especially to the destitute.</body></html>
