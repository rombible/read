What is noticeable here is the mention of the "neighbour cities." We may connect it with the fact that they are named as Admah and Zeboim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm" title="And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As in the overthrow,</span> etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-2.htm">Deuteronomy 29:2</a>, which explains the reference in "the neighbour cities" (Admah and Zeboim). The verse is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-40.htm">Jeremiah 50:40</a>; It does not, of course, mean that rite and brimstone should be the agents of destruction (nor is even <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9</a> to be understood literally), but that the desolate appearance of Edom should remind of that of the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:7-22 The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God. But their day is now at hand; it is foretold, not only to warn them, but for the sake of the Israel of God, whose afflictions were aggravated by them. Thus Divine judgments go round from nation to nation; the earth is full of commotion, and nothing can escape the ministers of Divine vengeance. The righteousness of God is to be observed amidst the violence of men.</body></html>
