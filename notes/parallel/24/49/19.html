The word translated "chosen one" is commonly associated with the idea of youth, the flower of a nation's strength, its chosen champions. Commentators for the most part apply it to Nebuchadnezzar as being, in the full vigour of his strength, the chosen ruler whom Jehovah would appoint over Edom. The interrogative form, however, and the implied negative answer to the questions that follow suggest a different interpretation. "Who," the prophet asks in a tone of scorn, as though Jehovah spoke by him, "is a chosen champion of Edom? and I will appoint him." The implied answer is that Edom has no such champion. Compare the taunting words uttered by Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-2.htm" title="Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor;">2Kings 10:2-3</a>)--"Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons"--and Rabshakeh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-23.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.">2Kings 18:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Who is like me? and who will appoint me the time?</span>--The questions follow rapidly one on another in the same tone. To "appoint a time" was the technical phrase, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-19.htm" title="If I speak of strength, see, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?">Job 9:19</a>, for the notice by which a prosecutor summoned the accused to trial. "Who," Jehovah asks, "will thus summon Me, and before what tribunal?" "What shepherd (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> what ruler) will stand before Me to defend his flock against My power?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - Figures descriptive of the unique physical qualities of the destined conqueror of Edom. Both figures have been used before (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall some. T</span>he subject is withheld, as in ch. 46:18 (see note); 48:40. <span class="cmt_word">The swelling of Jordan;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the pride of Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the luxuriant thickets on its banks. See on Jeremiah 12:5, where the phrase first occurs. <span class="cmt_word">Against the habitation of the strong</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to the evergreen pasture.</span> The word rendered "evergreen" is one of those which are the despair of interpreters, from their fulness of meaning. The root-meaning is simply "continuance," whether it be continuance of strength (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>, Hebrew) or of the flow of a stream (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>), or, as here, of the perennial verdure of a well watered pasturage. <span class="cmt_word">But I will suddenly make him run away from her.</span> Make whom? The lion? Such is the natural inference from the Authorized Version, but the context absolutely forbids it. It seems useless to mention the crowd of explanations which have been offered of this "obscure and much-vexed passage," as old Matthew Poole calls it, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a> we have precisely the same phrase, but with another suffix, which clears up the meaning. We may, therefore, either <span class="accented">read</span> (with the Septuagint and the Syriac Version), "For I will suddenly make them run away from it" (viz. the pasture), or keep the old reading "him" for "them," and explain "him" as meaning the Edomites. The expression used for "suddenly" is very forcible; we might render, with Ewald, "in the twinkling of an eye." <span class="cmt_word">And who is a chosen man,</span> etc.? A still more difficult clause. If the text is correct, which cannot be assumed as certain, we should probably render, with Ewald, "and will appoint over it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of Edom] him who is chosen," viz. Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Who will appoint me the time?</span> The same phrase is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>, "Who shall set me a time to plead?" (comp. the Latin phrase <span class="accented">dicur dicere</span>). To drag a defendant before the tribunal implies equality of rank. One might venture to do this with Nebuchadnezzar, if he were not the representative of One still mightier. Finally, <span class="cmt_word">Who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> The land of Edom has been likened to a pasture; it is natural that the ruler should be now described as a shepherd (comp. Jeremiah 29:34) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:7-22 The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God. But their day is now at hand; it is foretold, not only to warn them, but for the sake of the Israel of God, whose afflictions were aggravated by them. Thus Divine judgments go round from nation to nation; the earth is full of commotion, and nothing can escape the ministers of Divine vengeance. The righteousness of God is to be observed amidst the violence of men.</body></html>
