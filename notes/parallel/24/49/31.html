Resistance is impossible, for an enemy has never been dreamed cf. The tribes of Hazer are not, indeed, <span class="cmt_word">a wealthy nation,</span> for they have but little wealth to tempt either the conqueror or the merchant; they "live alone;" they are an uncommercial and unwarlike, but a profoundly "tranquil, nation, that dwelleth securely [or, 'confidently']" - a description reminding us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-7.htm">Judges 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>. In their idyllic, patriarchal state they feel no need of walls with their accompanying double gates (the gates of ancient cities were so large that they were divided) and bars.

He who conquered many strong cities, will not leave those unconquered that dwell in tents. He will do this to gratify his own covetousness and ambition; but God orders it for correcting an unthankful people, and for warning a careless world to expect trouble when they seem most safe. They shall flee, get far off, and dwell deep in the deserts; they shall be dispersed. But privacy and obscurity are not always protection and security.</body></html>
