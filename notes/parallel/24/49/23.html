The kingdom first became powerful under Rezon after David's death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23-24</a>). In the history of 1 and 2 Kings we find it engaged in constant wars against Israel and Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-1.htm" title="And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.">1Kings 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-8.htm" title="Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.">2Kings 6:8</a>) or in alliance with Israel against Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm" title="There is a league between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold; come and break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.">1Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2Kings 16:5-6</a>). The last of these alliances was the memorable confederacy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm" title="And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.">Isaiah 7:2</a>, between Rezin and Pekah. That ended, as Isaiah foretold, in the subjugation of Damascus by the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>). And so the Syrians continued subject till the downfall of the Assyrian Empire, when they naturally fell before the power of Nebuchadnezzar. The language of the prophet is vague, but probably points to his attack.<p><span class= "bld">Hamath is confounded, and Arpad.</span>--The former town was originally pointed out as the northern limit of the territory of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm" title="From mount Hor you shall point out your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:">Numbers 34:8</a>), and this was attained under Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.">2Chronicles 8:4</a>). It lies in a strong position in the valley of the Orontes, and under the name of <span class= "ital">Hamah </span>is still a flourishing city with 30,000 inhabitants, Arpad, always joined with Hamath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm" title="Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?">Isaiah 36:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-13.htm" title="Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?">Isaiah 37:13</a>), must at the time have been nearly as important. The name <span class= "ital">Arpaddu </span>has been found in cuneiform inscriptions, and its site has been placed at about fourteen miles north of Aleppo. For further details see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">There is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</span>--The mention of the sea in connexion with Damascus presents some difficulty. The most simple solution is probably the truest. The terror that prevails at Damascus is thought of as extending to the sea (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the Mediterranean), possibly with special reference to its commerce with Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>). All is restless and unquiet as the sea itself. The last clause seems like a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a>. Many MSS. give the various reading "<span class= "ital">like </span>the sea," which would make the parallelism more complete.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-27.</span> - The heading <span class="cmt_word">Concerning Damascus</span> is too limited (like that of the partly parallel prophecy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1-11</a>); for the prophecy relates, not only to Damascus, the capital of the kingdom of southeastern Aram (or Syria), but to Hamath, the capital of the northern kingdom. (The third of the Aramaean kingdoms, that of Zobah, had ceased to exist.) Damascus had already been threatened by Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3-5</a>), and by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1-11</a>). We may infer from the prophecy that Damascus had provoked the hostility of Nebuchadnezzar, but we have as yet no monumental evidence as to the facts. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span>. Still an important city under the name of Hamah, situated to the north of Hums (Emesa), on the Orontes. It formed nominally the boundary of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), was actually a part of the empire of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), and was conquered for a short time by Jeroboam II. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). Under Sargon it was fully incorporated into the Assyrian empire (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>); rebellious populations were repeatedly transplanted into the territory of Hamath. <span class="cmt_word">Arpad</span>. Always mentioned together with Hamath, whose fate it appears to have shared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>). A tell, or hill, with ruins, about three (German) miles from Aleppo, still bears the name Erfad (<span class="accented">Zeitschrift</span> of the German Oriental Society, 25:655). There is <span class="cmt_word">sorrow on the sea</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> even the sea participates in the agitation of that troublous time: somewhat as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> the sea is represented as sympathizing in the terror produced by a Divine manifestation. But by the slightest possible emendation (viz. of <span class="accented">caph</span> into <span class="accented">beth</span>) we obtain a more natural sense - "with an unrest <span class="accented">as of</span> the sea, which cannot be quiet." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a> we read, "For the ungodly are like the troubled sea, for it cannot be quiet;" and it can hardly be doubted that Jeremiah is alluding to this passage. If he altered it at all, it would be in the direction of greater smoothness rather than the reverse. Not a few manuscripts of Jeremiah actually have this corrected reading, which should probably be adopted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:23-27 How easily God can dispirit those nations that have been most celebrated for valour! Damascus waxes feeble. It was a city of joy, having all the delights of the sons of men. But those deceive themselves who place their happiness in carnal joys.</body></html>
