As yet Edom feels himself secure in his rocky home. But a Divine impulse already stirs the nation, through whom Jehovah wills to humble the proud. Edom shall become a second Sodom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have heard a rumour.</span> In Obadiah it is "<span class="accented">we</span> have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the company of prophets (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, "Who hath believed <span class="accented">our</span> report?" according to one interpretation). Jeremiah, to justify his adoption of the outward form of his prophecy, declares that he is personally responsible for its substance. "Rumour," or as the word is elsewhere rendered, "report," is a technical term for a prophetic revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>); and it is from this Old Testament usage that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span> acquires its special meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>. In fact, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span>, or bearing, is a more exact equivalent of the original. A prophet is one who has "listened in the council of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, corrected version; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), and "when the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who can but prophesy?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). Prophetic perception of Divine truth is so exceptional a thing that it can only be expressed approximately in terms of everyday life. One while it may be called a "hearing," a "report," another while a "vision" or "intuition." He who makes to hear or see is, of course, Jehovah, through the objective influence of his Spirit. It is important to study the Biblical phraseology, which has a depth of meaning too often overlooked, owing to the blunter edge which time has given to our modern speech. <span class="cmt_word">An ambassador;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a herald.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Unto the heathen;</span> rather, unto <span class="accented">the nations.</span> There is no religious idea involved; the word <span class="accented">goyim</span> literally means "nations," and there is no reason for deviating from the primary sense. In the next verse it is even more necessary to make this correction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:7-22 The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God. But their day is now at hand; it is foretold, not only to warn them, but for the sake of the Israel of God, whose afflictions were aggravated by them. Thus Divine judgments go round from nation to nation; the earth is full of commotion, and nothing can escape the ministers of Divine vengeance. The righteousness of God is to be observed amidst the violence of men.</body></html>
