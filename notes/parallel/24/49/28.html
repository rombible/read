In PP. 120:5 it appears as the representative of the fierce nomadic life of the Arabians. Hazor appears as the name of many cities in Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,">Joshua 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm" title="And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,">Joshua 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-36.htm" title="And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,">Joshua 19:36</a>), but the combination with Kedar points to quite a different region. The probable explanation is that Jeremiah uses the term (as a like word, <span class= "ital">haz?rein, </span>is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm" title="Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.">Isaiah 42:11</a> for the "villages" of Kedar) for the region in which the Kedar Arabs had ceased to be nomadic, and had made a permanent settlement. According to Niebuhr (<span class= "ital">Assur u. Bab., </span>p. 210) it answers to the modern <span class= "ital">Hadschar </span>in the angle formed by the southern course of the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf.<p><span class= "bld">Spoil the men of the east.</span>--Literally, the <span class= "ital">B'eni-Kedem. </span>or children of the East. The term appears in the Old Testament history from a very early date (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-1.htm" title="Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm" title="Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.">Judges 6:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm" title="And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.">1Kings 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm" title="His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.">Job 1:3</a>), and has, as might be expected, though obviously indicating a nomadic form of life, like that of the Midianites, a somewhat wide and undefined connotation. The picture of the attack on them presents a marked contrast to that of the attack on Damascus: not palaces and treasures, but tents and flocks, the curtains or hangings of the tent, their implements (weapons, kneading troughs, and the like), their very camels, seized by the conquerors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-33.</span> - Against the nomad and partly settled Arabs - the former described under the name <span class="cmt_word">Kedar</span> (see on Jeremiah 2:10), the latter under that of <span class="cmt_word">Hazor</span> (connected with <span class="accented">hazer</span>, an unwalled village; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-31.htm">Leviticus 25:31</a>). This use of Hazer is remarkable; elsewhere the name denotes towns in Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-33.htm">Nehemiah 11:33</a>). There are two plainly marked strophes, vers. 28-30 and 31-33, both beginning with a summons to the foe to take the field. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - Hazer (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the settled Arabs) is said to have <span class="cmt_word">kingdoms</span>. "King" is used in Hebrew in a wider sense than we are accustomed to (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>, "All the kings of Arabia"). The "kings" of Hazer would be mere sheikhs or emirs. <span class="cmt_word">Shall smite;</span> rather, <span class="accented">smote.</span> There is no justification whatever for the future. The statement is obviously a later addition, to show that the prophecy was fulfilled. On the form "Nebuchadrezzar," see on Jeremiah 21:2. <span class="cmt_word">The men of the east</span>. A general designation of the inhabitants of all the countries in the east of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:28-33 Nebuchadnezzar would make desolation among the people of Kedar, who dwelt in the deserts of Arabia. He who conquered many strong cities, will not leave those unconquered that dwell in tents. He will do this to gratify his own covetousness and ambition; but God orders it for correcting an unthankful people, and for warning a careless world to expect trouble when they seem most safe. They shall flee, get far off, and dwell deep in the deserts; they shall be dispersed. But privacy and obscurity are not always protection and security.</body></html>
