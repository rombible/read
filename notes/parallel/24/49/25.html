So he turned and went away in a rage.">2Kings 5:12</a>), had not been "left," would not be empty when it was taken. The people would perish with it. Her young warriors and her veterans should be cut off within the walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hew is the city of praise not left,</span> etc.! A difficult passage. The construction, indeed, is plain. "How is not," etc. I can only mean "How is it that the city of praise is not," etc.?(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>). The difficulty lies in the word rendered "left." The ordinary meaning of the verb, when applied to cities, is certainly "to leave without inhabitants;" <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>. This, however, does not suit the context, which shows that "the daughter of Damascus" personified is the speaker, so that ver. 25 ought rather to mean, "How is it that the city of praise <span class="accented">is</span> [not, '<span class="accented">is not'</span>] forsaken?" Either, then, we must suppose that "not" has been inserted by mistake - a too arbitrary step, seeing that there is no negative in the context to account for the insertion (the case is different, therefore, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-15.htm">Job 27:15</a>, where such an insertion is at any rate justifiable); or else we must give <span class="accented">uzzebhah</span> the sense of "let go free" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-5.htm">Exodus 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>). It is the obstinate incredulity of love which refuses to admit the possibility of the destruction of the loved object. <span class="accented">The city of praise.</span> The city which is my "praise," or boast. Few cities, in fact, have had so long and brilliant an existence as Damascus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:23-27 How easily God can dispirit those nations that have been most celebrated for valour! Damascus waxes feeble. It was a city of joy, having all the delights of the sons of men. But those deceive themselves who place their happiness in carnal joys.</body></html>
