On the journey of the Israelites to Canaan the Edomites were left unmolested (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm" title="But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.">Numbers 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm" title="And command you the people, saying, You are to pass through the coast of your brothers the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take you good heed to yourselves therefore:">Deuteronomy 2:4</a>). Conquered by Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1Samuel 14:47</a>), and yet more completely by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2Samuel 8:14</a>), they made an unsuccessful attempt to throw off the yoke in the time of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1Kings 11:14-22</a>), but finally revolted with success in that of Joram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/8-20.htm" title="In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.">2Kings 8:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-8.htm" title="In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.">2Chronicles 21:8</a>). Amaziah and Uzziah endeavoured to reassert dominion over them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm" title="He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.">2Kings 14:22</a>), but under Ahaz they invaded Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.">2Chronicles 28:17</a>), and in the reign of Zedekiah appear as an independent power seeking to ally themselves with that king against their common enemy Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a>). Soon, however, they allied themselves with the Chaldaeans, and were conspicuous for their triumphant exultation in the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm" title="Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.">Lamentations 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm" title="As you did rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you: you shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 35:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-5.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.">Ezekiel 36:5</a>). Obadiah had prophesied against them, probably shortly before Jeremiah's utterance, and what we find here stands in the same relation to his language as the prophecy against Moab in Jeremiah 48 does to Isaiah 15, 16. Possibly, however, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm" title="In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.">Obadiah 1:11</a> seems to indicate, Obadiah was the later of the two. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction </span>to Obadiah.)<p><span class= "bld">Is wisdom</span> <span class= "bld">no more in Teman . . .?</span>--The exact locality of Teman has not been determined, but it is always closely connected with Edom, and, as the word means "south," may describe that region of the Edomite country. Its fame for wisdom seems to have been proverbial. So Eliphaz the Temanite appears as the chief speaker among Job's three friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm" title="Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come on him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-1.htm" title="Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,">Job 4:1</a>). So Obadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-8.htm" title="Shall I not in that day, said the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?">Obadiah 1:8</a>) speaks of the "wise men" of Edom. So Solomon's wisdom excelled that of "the children of the East" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm" title="And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.">1Kings 4:30</a>). The form of the questions implies that all three are to be answered in the affirmative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - A startling picture of the judgment impending over Edom, the severity of which is to be inferred from the behaviour of the sufferers. Observe, no allusion is made by Jeremiah to any special bitter feeling of the Edomites towards the Israelites, such as is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35.htm">Ezekiel 35</a>, and other passages. With regard to the fulfilment of the prophecy, we may fairly quote in the first place <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-4</a>. The agents in the desolation there referred to (still fresh in Malachi's recollection) are probably the Nabathaeans (an Arab race, though writing Aramaic), who, after occupying Edom, dropped their nomad habits, devoted themselves to commerce, and founded the kingdom of Arabia Petraea. Meantime the Edomites maintained an independent existence in the midst of the Jewish colonists, till John Hyrcanus compelled them to accept circumcision about <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. In spite of this enforced religious and political union, the Edomites remained perfectly conscious of their nationality, and we find them mentioned as a distinct factor in the community in Josephus' account of the great Jewish war. They pass away from history after the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teman</span> was celebrated for its "wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for a practical moral philosophy, similar to that which we find in the less distinctly religions portions of the Book of Proverbs. It was this "wisdom" which formed the common element in the higher culture of the Semitic peoples, and of which the sacred narrator speaks when he says that "Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>). One of Job's friends, Eliphaz, was a Temanite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>). From ver. 20, however, it appears that Teman is here used for Edom in general, of which it formed a part. "Wisdom" was doubtless cultivated throughout Idumaea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>), the "land of Uz," in which Job dwelt, was probably in the east of Edom (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">Is their wisdom vanished?</span> The Hebrew, with its characteristic love for material symbols, has, "Is their wisdom poured out?" So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-7.htm">Jeremiah 19:7</a>, "I will pour out [a different word, however, is used] the counsel of Judah." The body being regarded as a vessel, it was natural to represent the principle of life, both physical (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>) and intellectual (as here), under the symbol of a liquid. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:7-22 The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God. But their day is now at hand; it is foretold, not only to warn them, but for the sake of the Israel of God, whose afflictions were aggravated by them. Thus Divine judgments go round from nation to nation; the earth is full of commotion, and nothing can escape the ministers of Divine vengeance. The righteousness of God is to be observed amidst the violence of men.</body></html>
