Idumaea was a populous and powerful country in the time of John Hyrcanus. Petra, as we have seen, was rebuilt by the Romans as a centre of trade and government, and had its baths, and theatres, and temples. But the end came at last, and there are few lands, once the seat of a thriving nation, more utterly desolate than that of Edom. From the ninth century of the Christian era it disappears from history (Robinson's <span class= "ital">Researches, ii.</span> 575).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A desolation;</span> rather, <span class="accented">an astonishment.</span> The word is from the same root as the following verb. The phrase is characteristic of Jeremiah, who has no scruple in repeating a forcible expression, and so enforcing an important truth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a>). What so "astonishing" as the reverses of once flourishing kingdoms! For the Bible knows nothing of the "necessity" of the decay and death of nations. The "covenant" which Jehovah offers contains the pledge of indestructibility. <span class="cmt_word">Everyone that goeth by it,</span> etc. Another self-reminiscence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:7-22 The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God. But their day is now at hand; it is foretold, not only to warn them, but for the sake of the Israel of God, whose afflictions were aggravated by them. Thus Divine judgments go round from nation to nation; the earth is full of commotion, and nothing can escape the ministers of Divine vengeance. The righteousness of God is to be observed amidst the violence of men.</body></html>
