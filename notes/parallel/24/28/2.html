With something, it may be, of ironical repetition, he reproduces the very formula with which the true prophet had begun his message. He, too, can speak in the name of "the Lord of Sabaoth, the God of Israel."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Hananiah opens his prophecy with the usual formula, claiming Divine inspiration in the fullest sense. His message is short and sweet: <span class="cmt_word">I have broken</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have decreed to break (the perfect of prophetic certitude) - <span class="cmt_word">the yoke of the king of Babylon</span>. Had Hananiah stopped here, he might, perhaps, have escaped Jeremiah's indignant rebuke. But with light-hearted arrogance he ventures to fix a time close at hand for the event, which, no doubt, was destined to occur, but after a long interval. Dr. Payne Smith suggests that he probably cherished the belief that the confederacy then on foot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>) would defeat Nebuchadnezzar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-9 Hananiah spoke a false prophecy. Here is not a word of good counsel urging the Jews to repent and return to God. He promises temporal mercies, in God's name, but makes no mention of the spiritual mercies which God always promised with earthly blessings. This was not the first time Jeremiah had prayed for the people, though he prophesied against them. He appeals to the event, to prove Hananiah's falsehood. The prophet who spake only of peace and prosperity, without adding that they must not by wilful sin stop God's favours, will be proved a false prophet. Those who do not declare the alarming as well as the encouraging parts of God's word, and call men to repentance, and faith, and holiness, tread in the steps of the false prophets. The gospel of Christ encourages men to do works meet for repentance, but gives no encouragement to continue in sin.</body></html>
