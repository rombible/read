And there was, therefore, an antecedent probability in favour of one who spoke in the same tone now, rather than of those who held out flattering hopes of peace and victory. The <span class= "ital">onus probandi </span>in such a conflict of claims lay with the latter, not the former. Prophecies like those of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/21-21.htm" title="Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,">1Kings 21:21-24</a>), Micaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm" title="And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.">1Kings 22:17</a>), Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm" title="Then spoke Elisha to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.">2Kings 8:1</a>), Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/1-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.">Joel 1:1-20</a>), Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-11.htm" title="I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.">Hosea 2:11-12</a>), Amos (Amos 1-4), Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>), Isaiah (Isaiah 2-6), were probably in Jeremiah's thoughts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-9 Hananiah spoke a false prophecy. Here is not a word of good counsel urging the Jews to repent and return to God. He promises temporal mercies, in God's name, but makes no mention of the spiritual mercies which God always promised with earthly blessings. This was not the first time Jeremiah had prayed for the people, though he prophesied against them. He appeals to the event, to prove Hananiah's falsehood. The prophet who spake only of peace and prosperity, without adding that they must not by wilful sin stop God's favours, will be proved a false prophet. Those who do not declare the alarming as well as the encouraging parts of God's word, and call men to repentance, and faith, and holiness, tread in the steps of the false prophets. The gospel of Christ encourages men to do works meet for repentance, but gives no encouragement to continue in sin.</body></html>
