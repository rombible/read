In part, perhaps, the threat may have tended to work out its own fulfilment through the gnawing consciousness of shame and confusion in the detection of the false prophet's assumptions. He knew that the Lord had not sent him. Seven months passed, and then the stroke fell. It is one of the instances of the prophet's work, as "rooting out" and "pulling down" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm" title="See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.">Jeremiah 1:10</a>), and has its parallels in the punishment of Ananias, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-4.htm" title="Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.">Acts 5:4-5</a>, and of Elymas, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm" title="And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.">Acts 13:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will east thee</span>; rather, I song <span class="accented">thee away</span>. Possibly, as Hitzig suggests, there is an allusion to the preceding verse, in which the same verb occurs. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast taught rebellion</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thou hast spoken turning aside</span>. To "speak turning aside (or, 'rebellion')" is a phrase of Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>), where it is used, as here, of opposition, not to Jehovah, but to revealed truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:10-17 Hananiah is sentenced to die, and Jeremiah, when he has received direction from God, boldly tells him so; but not before he received that commission. Those have much to answer for, who tell sinners that they shall have peace, though they harden their hearts in contempt of God's word. The servant of God must be gentle to all men. He must give up even his right, and leave the Lord to plead his cause. Every attempt of ungodly men to make vain the purposes of God, will add to their miseries.</body></html>
