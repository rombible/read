So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm" title="The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.">Daniel 7:4</a> the lion is the symbol of the Assyrian monarchy. The winged lions that are seen in the palaces of Mosul and Nimroud gave a special character to what was in any case a natural metaphor. The word "Gentiles" answers to the meaning, but there is no special reason why it should be used here, rather than <span class= "ital">nations.</span><p><span class= "bld">Is on</span> <span class= "bld">his way.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">has broken up his encampment, i.e., </span>has started on his march.<p><span class= "bld">Without an inhabitant.</span>--The language, like that of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-11.htm" title="Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,">Isaiah 6:11</a>), was probably in some measure hyperbolical, but the depopulation caused by the Chaldaean invasion (as seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.">Jeremiah 39:9</a>) must have been extreme.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lion</span>; the symbol of irresistible might and royalty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the Gentiles</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the nations</span>. There is no reference to the distinction between Jews and Gentiles; the Jews themselves are not allowed to escape. An ordinary lion attacks individual men; this lion destroys nations. <span class="cmt_word">Is on his way</span>; literally, <span class="accented">has broken up his encampment - a</span> phrase perhaps suggested by the nomad Scythiaus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:5-18 The fierce conqueror of the neighbouring nations was to make Judah desolate. The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulled into security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy is described. Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.</body></html>
