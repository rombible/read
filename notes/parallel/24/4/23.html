The prophet is again the speaker, but in a calmer mood. God's judgment has been pronounced, and it is not for him to rebel. He has now simply to record the vision of woe which has been granted him. He foresees the utter desolation into which not only the land of Judah, <span class="cmt_word">but the earth</span> in general, will be brought, and which reminds him of nothing so much as the "waste and wild" condition of the earth previous to the first creative word. But why is "the earth" mentioned in this connection? Because the judgment upon Judah is but one act in the great general judgment which, when completed, will issue in a fresh order of things (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>, where side by side are mentioned Jehovah's judgment of "the peoples" and of "his people," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>, where the judgment upon the enemies of Israel is interwoven with the judgment upon "the earth"). <span class="cmt_word">Without form, and void</span>; rather, waste <span class="accented">and</span> wild (to represent in some degree the characteristic assonance of the original - tohu <span class="accented">va-bohu</span>); more literally, <span class="accented">immovable and lifeless</span>. It is the phrase used in Genesis L 2 for primeval chaos. <span class="accented">Tohu</span> and <span class="accented">bohu</span> occur in parallel lines in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>, to express utter desolation; <span class="accented">tohu</span> alone five times in the Book of Isaiah, and once in Job. <span class="cmt_word">They had no light</span>. The heavens were in the same condition as on the third day, subsequently to the creation of the heavens, but prior to that of the luminaries. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.</body></html>
