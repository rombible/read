The clause, "and not wander," seems too short; the Septuagint had a choicer reading, "and put away, etc., from his [thy] mouth, and not wander from before me." It is the close of the prophecy which we have here. The prophet subjoins a promise which he has heard from Jehovah. True, it does not appeal to Israel's self-love (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13-16</a>), but to a nobler feeling of responsibility for the world's welfare. Israel has been entrusted with a mission, and on the due performance of this mission hangs the weal or woe of humanity. Hence Jehovah's longing for Israel's repentance. If Israel will but "return," and obey God's commandments, all nations will be attracted to the true religion. The form of expression used for the latter statement is borrowed probably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a> (it is less closely parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). To "bless <span class="accented">by"</span> any one is to use his name in the benediction formula. Seeing Israel so blessed through his allegiance to Jehovah, all nations shall wish themselves a similar blessing (the reverse of the process in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>). To "swear, As Jehovah liveth," means to call Jehovah to witness to the truth of a statement. This is to be done "with good faith," etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">the</span> object of the oath must be consistent with honesty and probity. Abominations; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">idols</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> often (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1,2 The first two verses should be read with the last chapter.
