Not man only, but the creatures that seemed least open to man's attack, were fled. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>.) The same thought re-appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm" title="For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.">Jeremiah 9:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.</body></html>
