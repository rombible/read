Woe to us! for we are spoiled.">Jeremiah 4:13</a>, the words may be Jeremiah's own cry of anguish, or that of the despairing people with whom he identifies himself. The latter gives more dramatic vividness, as we thus have the utterances of three of the great actors in the tragedy: here of the people, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm" title="For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are silly children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.">Jeremiah 4:22</a> of Jehovah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm" title="I beheld the earth, and, see, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.">Jeremiah 4:23</a> of the prophet. The "bowels" were with the Hebrews thought of as the seat of all the strongest emotions, whether of sorrow, fear, or sympathy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-27.htm" title="My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.">Job 30:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">At my very heart.</span>--Literally (reproducing the physical fact of palpitation), <span class= "ital">I writhe in pain; the walls of my heart! my heart moans for me. </span>The verb for "I am pained" is often used for the "travail" or agony of childbirth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm" title="Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.">Isaiah 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm" title="We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.">Isaiah 26:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast heard, O my soul . . .</span>--Silence at such a time was impossible. The prophet, as in the language of strong emotion, addresses his own soul, his very self (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm" title="O my soul, you have said to the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;">Psalm 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm" title="Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted in me? hope you in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.">Psalm 42:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-11.htm" title="Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted within me? hope you in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.">Psalm 42:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My bowels</span>. It is doubted whether the speaker in vers. 19-21 is the prophet or the whole nation. Ver. 19 reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a> and Isaiah 21:3, 4, and would be quite in harmony with the elegiac tone of our prophet elsewhere; the Targum too already regards the passage as an exclamation of the prophet. On the other hand, the phrase "my tents" (ver. 20) certainly implies that the people, or the pious section of the people, is the speaker. Both views may perhaps be united. The prophet may be the speaker in ver. 19, but simply (as is the case with so many of the psalmists) as the representative of his fellow-believers, whom in ver. 20 he brings on the stage more directly. Ver. 19 is best rendered as a series of exclamations - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"My bowels! my bowels! I must writhe in pain!<br />The walls of my heart! My heart moaneth unto me!<br />I cannot hold my peace!<br />For thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,<br />The alarm of war!"</span> Observe, the "soul" hears; the "heart" is pained. So generally the one is more active, the other more passive. The Hebrew margin gives, for "I must writhe," "I must wait" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-7.htm">Micah 7:7</a>); but this rendering does not suit the context. <span class="cmt_word">The walls of my heart</span>. A poetical way of saying, "My heart beats." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.</body></html>
