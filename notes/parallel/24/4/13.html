(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm" title="And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.">Ezekiel 38:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Swifter than eagles.</span>--A possible quotation from David's lament over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm" title="Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.">2Samuel 1:23</a>). The fact that another phrase is quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-30.htm" title="And when you are spoiled, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with crimson, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you rend your face with painting, in vain shall you make yourself fair; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.">Jeremiah 4:30</a> ("clothest thyself with crimson," where the Hebrew is the same as the "scarlet" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm" title="You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.">2Samuel 1:24</a>), makes the possibility something like a certainty. It was natural that one who himself wrote two sets of lamentations, one early (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm" title="And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.">2Chronicles 35:25</a>), the other late, in life, should have been a student of earlier elegies.

The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulled into security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy is described. Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.</body></html>
