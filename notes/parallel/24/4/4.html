He saw that the "foreskin of the heart" was the fleshly, unrenewed nature, the "flesh" as contrasted with the "spirit," the "old man" which St. Paul contrasts with the new (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm" title="Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.">Romans 8:7</a>). The verbal coincidence, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm" title="Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a> shows the influence of that book, of which we find so many traces in Jeremiah's teaching.<p><span class= "bld">Lest my fury come forth like fire . . .</span>--The words, which describe the righteousness of Jehovah as a consuming fire, have their parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-20.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.">Jeremiah 7:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-6.htm" title="Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.">Amos 5:6</a>, and form the transition to the picture of terror which opens in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Circumcise yourselves to the Lord</span>. A significant passage. All the Jews were circumcised, but not all were "circumcised to the Lord." There were but too many who were "circumcised in uncircumcision" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>), and the prophet sternly reduces ouch circumcision to the level of the heathenish rite of cutting off the hair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; comp. Herod. 3:8). Jeremiah seems to have been specially anxious to counteract a merely formal, ritualistic notion of circumcision, sharing in this, as in other points, the influence of the Book of Deuteronomy, so lately found in the temple (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>). To him the venerable rite of circumcision (older, certainly, than Abraham) is a symbol of the devotion of the heart to its rightful Lord (comp. St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:3,4 An unhumbled heart is like ground untilled. It is ground which may be improved; it is our ground let out to us; but it is fallow; it is over-grown with thorns and weeds, the natural product of the corrupt heart. Let us entreat the Lord to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us; for except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.</body></html>
