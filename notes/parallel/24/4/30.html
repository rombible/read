Woe to us! for we are spoiled.">Jeremiah 4:13</a>), an echo from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm" title="You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.">2Samuel 1:24</a>. The "rending the face" is, literally, <span class= "ital">enlarging the eyes </span>with <span class= "ital">kohl, </span>or antimony, still used for this purpose in the east, the black powder being laid on horizontally with a small <span class= "ital">stylus, </span>or pencil, drawn between the eyelashes. The daughter of Zion is represented as a woman who puts on her costliest attire, as Jezebel had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm" title="And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.">2Kings 9:30</a>), in the vain hope of fascinating her lovers. The imagery points to the foreign alliances in which the statesmen and people of Jerusalem were trusting, and they are told that they shall be in vain. The lovers, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the allies, shall become her foes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when thou art spoiled</span>, etc. It is Jerusalem who is addressed - Jerusalem, personified as a woman, who decks herself out finely to please her admirers. All these arts are in vain, for a violent repulsion has converted her lovers into her deadly enemies. And when Jerusalem is "spoiled," or taken by storm, what device will there be left to attempt? The "lovers" are the foreign powers to whom the Jews paid court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18, 36</a>, 87). <span class="cmt_word">Though thou rentest thy face</span>, etc; alluding to the custom of Eastern women, who try to make their eyes seem larger by putting powdered antimony (the Arabic <span class="accented">kohl</span>) upon their eyelids. So, for instance, did Jezebel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>:30); and one of Job's daughters received the name Keren-happuch, "box of antimony," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. one who sets off the company in which she is, as antimony does the eye. An old author, Dr. Shaw, writes thus: "None of these ladies take themselves to be completely dressed till they have tinged the hair and edges of their eyelids with the powder of lead ore. And as this operation is performed by dipping first into this powder a small wooden bodkin of the thickness of a quill, and then drawing it afterwards through the eyelids over the ball of the eye, we have a lively image of what the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) may be supposed to mean" (Shaw, 'Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 229). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.</body></html>
