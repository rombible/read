Had not Jehovah apparently sanctioned those prophets also? and, if so, had He not deceived the people? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>.) This seems, on the whole, preferable to the interpretations which see in it a dramatic irony representing the prophet as having shared in the hopes of the people and awakening to a terrible disappointment, or refer the words to the contrast between the glorious visions of the future in Isaiah and his own terrible predictions, or to the bolder course of an alteration of the text, so that the words would run "it is said," the complaint being represented as coming from the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God</span>! rather, Alas! O <span class="accented">Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> on Jeremiah 1:6). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast greatly deceived this people</span>, etc. Much difficulty has been felt in interpreting this verse, partly because it seems directly to charge Jehovah with "deceit," and partly because the prophecy, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall have peace</span>, on which this charge is founded, accords exactly with the strain of the "false prophets" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>). Hence some (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ewald) have altered the points of the verb at the beginning of the verse., so as to enable them to render. "And one shall <span class="accented">say</span>," <span class="accented">the</span> subject understood being either a "false prophet" or one of the people. This view is not in itself impossible (Keil's objection will not bear examination), but is not absolutely necessary, for the present is not the only passage in which Jeremiah, under the influence of strong emotion, charges Jehovah with "deceit" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>, a synonymous word is used; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-23.htm">1 Kings 22:23</a>), and the words, "Ye shall have peace, may be meant to summarize the cheering promises in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14-18</a>. Jeremiah may (it is not incorrect to conjecture) have supposed the fulfillment of his prophecy to be nearer than it really was (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>); hence his disappointment, and hence his strong language. So St. Jerome, "Quia supra dixerat, In illo tempore vocabunt Jerusalem solium Dei, etc.. et nunc dicit, Peribit cor regis, turbatur propheta et in se Deum putat esse meutitum; nec intelligit, illud multa post tempera repromissum, hoc autem vicino futurum tempore." To suppose, with Keil, that Jeremiah refers the prophecies of the "false prophets" to God as their ultimate Author, seems inconsistent with Jeremiah's own statements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13</a>). Moreover, we have parallels elsewhere in the prophets, as well as in the Book of Job, for the use of language with regard to Providence which a calmer judgment would condemn. A notable instance is <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>, where the Jewish Church, through its mouthpiece the prophet, throws the responsibility of its errors upon Jehovah. Depressed by melancholy, they give way for the moment to those human "thoughts" which are not as "My thoughts." They felt the "burden of the mystery." <span class="cmt_word">Unto the soul</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. unto the life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:5-18 The fierce conqueror of the neighbouring nations was to make Judah desolate. The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulled into security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy is described. Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.</body></html>
