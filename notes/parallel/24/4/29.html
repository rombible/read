On the caves of Palestine as places of refuge in time of war, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm" title="And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he rises to shake terribly the earth.">Isaiah 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm" title="When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.">1Samuel 13:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The whole city</span>. The reading of which this is a version can hardly be the right one; for "the whole city" can only be Jerusalem, and in ver. 6 the people outside are bidden to take refuge in the capital. Hence Ewald, Hitzig, and Payne Smith (after Septuagint, Targum) would slightly amend the word rendered "city," so as to translate "the whole land" (of Judah). <span class="cmt_word">Shall flee</span>; <span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">fleeth</span>. So afterwards render, "have gone.... is forsaken," "dwelleth." It is a vivid dramatic representation of the effects of the invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Bowmen</span>. It is singular that Herodotus should say nothing about the use of the bow by the Chaldeans. But the monuments give ample evidence that they were a people of archers. So of course were the Scythians, as Herodotus testifies. <span class="cmt_word">The rooks</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the limestone caverns which abound in Palestine, and which were frequently used as strongholds and hiding-places (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-11.htm">1 Samuel 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a> (especially); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.</body></html>
