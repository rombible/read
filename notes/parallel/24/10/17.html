Now the prophet returns to his main theme, the devastation of the land of Israel as the penalty of that sin. He begins with a vivid touch in the picture of utter misery. The daughter of Israel (the word "inhabitant" is feminine), sitting as in a besieged fortress, is to gather up her goods and chattels into one small <span class= "ital">bundle </span>(the English "wares" suggests the idea of trade, which is foreign to the context), and with that as the sole remnant of her possessions, to go forth into exile. Probably, indeed, the word may mean simply the <span class= "ital">travelling carpet </span>or mantle which the exile was to take with him. The whole phrase has something of a proverbial type, like our "bag and baggage" or the <span class= "ital">collige sarcinulas et exi </span>("take up your packages and begone") of Juven. <span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span> 146.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-22.</span> - This passage connects itself immediately with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9</a>, where the invasion of Judah and the dispersion of its inhabitants have been foretold. Here, after describing dramatically the departure of the latter into exile, the prophet reports a distinct revelation of the same fact, so that this can no longer be assumed to be mere imaginative rhetoric. The Jewish people is then introduced, lamenting her sad fate, but expressing resignation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gather up thy wares</span>. "Wares" should rather be <span class="accented">bundle</span>. There is no allusion to trafficking. <span class="cmt_word">O inhabitant of the fortress</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou that dwellest besieged</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:17-25 The Jews who continued in their own land, felt secure. But, sooner or later, sinners will find all things as the word of God has declared, and that its threatenings are not empty terrors. Submission will support the believer under every grief allotted to him; but what can render the load of Divine vengeance easy to be borne by those who fall under it in sullen despair? Those cannot expect to prosper, who do not, by faith and prayer, take God with them in all their ways. The report of the enemy's approach was very dreadful. Yet the designs which men lay deep, and think well formed, are dashed to pieces in a moment. Events are often overruled, so as to be quite contrary to what we intended and expected. If the Lord has directed our steps into the ways of peace and righteousness, let us entreat him to enable us to walk therein. Say not, Lord, do not correct me; but, Lord, do not correct me in anger. We may bear the smart of God's rod, but we cannot bear the weight of his wrath. Those who restrain prayer, prove that they know not God; for those who know him will seek him, and seek his favour. If even severe corrections lead sinners to be convinced of wholesome truths, they will have abundant cause for gratitude. And they will then humble themselves before the Lord.</body></html>
