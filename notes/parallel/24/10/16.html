<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-57.htm" title="You are my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep your words.">Psalm 119:57</a>, God is described as the "portion," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as the treasure and inheritance of His people. He is no powerless idol, but the former, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the creator, of all things, or more literally <span class= "ital">of the all, i.e., </span>of the universe.<p><span class= "bld">The rod of his inheritance.</span>--The phrase was familiar in the poetry of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm" title="Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old; the rod of your inheritance, which you have redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein you have dwelled.">Psalm 74:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-17.htm" title="O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.">Isaiah 63:17</a>--Heb.), but its exact meaning is not clear. The word may be "rod" in the sense of "sceptre," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm" title="Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the middle of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.">Micah 7:14</a>. Israel is that over which, or by means of which, God rules. But the other meaning in which it stands for "stem," "division," "tribe" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-13.htm" title="The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.">Isaiah 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-21.htm" title="And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.">Exodus 28:21</a>), is equally tenable.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord of hosts is his name.</span>--The time-honoured and awful name is obviously brought in as in emphatic contrast to all the names of the gods of the heathen. Among them all there was no name like "Jehovah Sabaoth," the Lord of the armies of heaven, of the stars in their courses, of the angels in their ordered ranks, and of the armies of Israel upon earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The portion of Jacob</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Jehovah. The phrase appears to have been coined at a lower level of religion, when every nation was supposed to have its own patron deity; just as the prophet says, ironically, to the fetish-worshippers of Israel, "Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>), and Moses, in Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), speaks of the host of heaven as having been "divided [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. assigned] unto all nations under the whole heaven." But, of course, the phrase is susceptible of a high, spiritual application (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>). God's people are, by their very conception, an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span>, chosen out by God, and choosing him, and not the world, for their portion. "Making the best of both worlds" is an object implicitly condemned by this consecrated phrase. <span class="cmt_word">The former of all things</span>. How much more forcible is the original phrase: "... of the whole," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the universe! "To form" is a phrase constantly used of God in the second part of Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of his</span> <span class="cmt_word">inheritance</span>. "Rod" should rather be <span class="accented">tribe</span>. The twelve tribes had an inner unity, as contrasted with other peoples; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a> ("tribes"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-16 The prophet shows the glory of Israel's God, and exposes the folly of idolaters. Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.</body></html>
