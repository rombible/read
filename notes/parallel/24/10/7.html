As time went on, the sacred writers became more and more distinct in their assertions of the truth that Jehovah, the Self-revealing God, is not Israel's King only, but also of the world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To thee doth it appertain</span>; viz. that men should fear thee.

Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.</body></html>
