The verses that follow are so closely parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/46-5.htm" title="To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?">Isaiah 46:5-7</a> (where see Notes), that the natural conclusion is that one writer had seen the work of the other. The grandeur and fulness of Isaiah's language, and the unlikeness of what we find here to Jeremiah's usual style, makes it more probable that he was the copyist, and so far adds to the argument for the authorship of the chapter ascribed to Isaiah. It is, however, possible, as some critics have thought, that these verses are an interpolation, and in that case they supply no evidence either way. The fact that they are found in the LXX. as well as in the Hebrew is, however, in favour of their genuineness. It may be noted that the substance of what follows has a parallel in the Epistle ascribed to Jeremiah in the apocryphal book of Baruch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The customs of the people</span>. "People" should, as usual, be corrected into <span class="accented">peoples</span> - the heathen nations are referred to. The Hebrew has "the statutes;" but the Authorized Version is substantially right, customs having a force as of iron in Eastern countries. It seems to be implied that the "customs" are of religious origin (setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-8.htm">2 Kings 17:8</a>, where "the statutes of the heathen" are obviously the rites and customs of polytheism. <span class="cmt_word">For one cutteth a tree</span>, etc. This is intended to prove the foregoing statement of the "vanity," or groundlessness, of idolatry. The order of the Hebrew, however, is more forcible, for <span class="accented">as wood out of the forest one cutteth it</span>, <span class="accented">viz</span>. the idol. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-16 The prophet shows the glory of Israel's God, and exposes the folly of idolaters. Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.</body></html>
