<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-36.htm" title="Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.">Exodus 25:36</a>), and is here applied (if we accept this meaning) to the twisted palm-like columns of a temple, to which the stiff, formal figure of the idol, with arms pressed close to the side, and none of the action which we find in Greek statues, is compared; (2) the other meaning adopted by many commentators is that of "a garden of gourds or cucumbers," and the word is so rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>. The comparison, in the so-called "Epistle of Jeremy" in the apocryphal book of Baruch (10:70), of an idol to "a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers" shows that the latter meaning was the accepted one when that Epistle was written. The thought, on this view, is that the idol which the men of Judah were worshipping was like one of the "pillars" (so the word for "palm tree" is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-6.htm" title="Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-30.htm" title="And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.">Joel 2:30</a>), the Hermes, or Priapus-figures which were placed by Greeks and Romans in gardens and orchards as scarecrows. Like figures appear to have been used by the Ph?nicians for the same purpose, and the practice, like the kindred worship of the <span class= "ital">Asherah, </span>would seem to have been gaining ground even in Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are upright as the palm tree</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they are like a pillar</span> (i.e. a <span class="accented">scarecrow</span>) <span class="accented">in a field of cucumbers</span>. This is the interpretation given to our passage in Ver. 70 of the apocryphal Epistle o!

Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.</body></html>
