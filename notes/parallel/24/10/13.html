The prophet finds the tokens of Almighty Power alike in the fixed order of the Cosmos and its most catastrophic perturbations. The strict construction of the Hebrew gives, <span class= "ital">At the voice of His giving the roar of waters.</span><p><span class= "bld">He maketh lightnings.</span>--The last half of the verse agrees verbally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm" title="He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightning for the rain; he brings the wind out of his treasuries.">Psalm 135:7</a> (where see Note), and one is obviously a quotation from the other, or both from some common source. We have no data, however, for saying which is the older of the two. The idea of the "treasure chambers" from which the winds are brought appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm" title="Have you entered into the treasures of the snow? or have you seen the treasures of the hail,">Job 38:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he uttereth his voice</span>, etc. The phrase is difficult, but the Authorized Version probably gives the right sense. God's "voice" is the thunder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>), which is accompanied by the gathering of heavy clouds ("His pavilion round about him," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He causeth the vapors to ascend,</span> etc.; the storm-clouds coming up more and more thickly from the horizon. From this point the verse agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> (the psalm is full of such reminiscences, and is obviously very late). <span class="cmt_word">Lightning's with rain;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for the</span> rain. The lightning's are, as it were, the heralds or attendants of the rain. <span class="cmt_word">The wind out of his treasures</span>; a noble figure, used elsewhere of the snow and hail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>), and of the waters of the sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-16 The prophet shows the glory of Israel's God, and exposes the folly of idolaters. Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.</body></html>
