Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.">Genesis 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-3.htm" title="But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.">Jonah 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12</a>), from whence Palestine, through the Phoenicians, was chiefly supplied with silver, tin, and other metals.<p><span class= "bld">Uphaz.</span>--Possibly an error of transcription, or dialectical variation, for Ophir, giving the meaning "gold-coast." The word is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>. Some interpreters, however, connect it with the name of Hyphasis, one of the tributaries of the Indus. We cannot attain to greater certainty. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm" title="And they came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.">1Kings 9:28</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Blue and purple.</span>--Both were colours obtained from the <span class= "ital">murex, </span>a Mediterranean shell-fish, and were used both for the curtains of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm" title="And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,">Exodus 25:4</a>) and for the gorgeous apparel of the idols of the heathen. "Purple," as elsewhere in the English of the Bible, must be understood of a deep crimson or scarlet. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-28.htm" title="And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.">Matthew 27:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm" title="And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,">Mark 15:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse apparently once followed Ver. 5. Like Vers. 7 and 8, it is omitted in the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">Silver spread into plates</span>, etc. The silver and gold were meant for the coating of the wooden image (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Tartessus, in south-west Spain, between the two mouths of the Baetis, or Guadal-quivir. <span class="cmt_word">Gold from Uphaz</span>. A place bearing this name, or anything like it, is not known from other sources than the Old Testament writings; and hence a corruption of the text has naturally been suspected (Ophir into Uphaz). As, however, r and z are not easily confounded, either in the earlier or the later Hebrew characters, this view must be abandoned, though it has the authority of several ancient versions of this passage (including the Peshite and the Targum). The name occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>. The Peshite, moreover, curiously enough, translates <span class="accented">zahab mufaz</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a> (Authorized Version, "the best gold") by "gold from Ophir." <span class="cmt_word">Blue and purple</span>. The Hebrew has no word, strictly speaking, for either "blue" or "purple." Both these words here used probably express coloring matter rather than colors (this is certain of the latter word, which properly designates a kind of mussel, the shell of which yielded dye). The first produced a violet purple, the second a reddish purple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-16 The prophet shows the glory of Israel's God, and exposes the folly of idolaters. Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.</body></html>
