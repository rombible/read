"The snow never leaves the summit of Lebanon; the waters which take their rise therein never dry up; but my people have forgotten the law of their being, the source of their prosperity." The rendering of the first clause is, however, grammatically dubious (there is no example of this construction of '<span class="accented">azabh</span>), and all the old versions point to (or at least favor) a reading, <span class="accented">Shaddai</span> (the Almighty) instead of <span class="accented">sadai</span> (the field). If we keep the text, we must explain "the rock of the field" on the analogy of "my mountain in the field" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>), as meaning "the rock which commands a wide prospect over the open lowland country," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Mount Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">The cold flowing waters</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the numerous "streams from Lebanon," referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-15.htm">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That come from another place;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whoso sources are foreign. But as this does not suit the connection, it is better to take the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">zarim</span>), usually rendered "foreign," in the sense of "pressing or hurrying along," with Ewald, Graf, and virtually Henderson. It thus becomes descriptive of these streams "as contracted within narrow channels while descending through the gorges and defiles of the <span class="accented">rocks</span>." Camp. "like an oppressing stream," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a> (a cognate verb). <span class="cmt_word">Be forsaken</span>. The Hebrew text has "be plucked up' (i.e. destroyed?); but as this is unsuitable, we must transpose two letters (as in not a few other cases), and render, <span class="accented">dry up</span>. <span class="accented">So</span> Gesenius, Graf, Keil, Delitzsch, and Payne Smith. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:11-17 Sinners call it liberty to live at large; whereas for a man to be a slave to his lusts, is the very worst slavery. They forsook God for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising. But what will they do in the day of judgment!</body></html>
