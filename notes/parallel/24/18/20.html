What it meant here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-6.htm" title="They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have dig a pit before me, into the middle whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.">Psalm 57:6</a>) was that the man was treated as a beast, the prophet who sought their good as the wolf or the jackal whom they entrapped and slew.<p><span class= "bld">Remember that I stood before </span>thee.--The phrase is used frequently, though not uniformly, of the act of worship, of the communion of the soul with God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-10.htm" title="And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?">Jeremiah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm" title="Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-10.htm" title="You stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm" title="And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD.

The prophet refers to his repeated though fruitless entreaties for the people in Jeremiah 14, 15. It is interesting to note the description of Jeremiah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-14.htm" title="Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.">2 Maccabees 15:14</a>, as "a lover of the brethren who prayeth much for the people and the holy city." Men had come to recognise that the spirit of intercession had been the prophet's dominant characteristic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the people devised devices against him. Thus do sinners deal with the great Intercessor, crucifying him afresh, and speaking against him on earth, while his blood is speaking for them in heaven. But the prophet had done his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicing in a day of evil.</body></html>
