The difference does not much affect the meaning. The east wind blowing from the desert was the wind of storms, tempests, and parching heat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.">Jonah 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm" title="You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm" title="In measure, when it shoots forth, you will debate with it: he stays his rough wind in the day of the east wind.">Isaiah 27:8</a>). I will shew them the back, and not the face.--The figure is boldly anthropomorphic. The light of God's countenance is the fulness of joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-25.htm" title="The LORD make his face shine on you, and be gracious to you:">Numbers 6:25</a>). To turn away that light was to leave the people to the darkness of their misery. What was thus done by Jehovah was but a righteous retribution on the people who had "turned their back" and "not their face" to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm" title="Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.">Jeremiah 2:27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As with an east wind</span>.

They forsook God for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising. But what will they do in the day of judgment!</body></html>
