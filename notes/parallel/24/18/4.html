The prophet went by the impulse which he knew to be from God to the "field" in the valley of Hinnom; he stood and gazed, and then as he watched he was led to see in the potter's work a parable of the world's history: God as the great artificer, men and nations as the vessels which He makes for honourable or dishonourable uses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm" title="But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.">2Timothy 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the vessel that he made</span>, etc.; rather, And <span class="accented">whensoever the vessel... was marred in the hand of the potter</span>, <span class="accented">he made it again another vessel</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-10 While Jeremiah looks upon the potter's work, God darts into his mind two great truths. God has authority, and power, to form and fashion kingdoms and nations as he pleases. He may dispose of us as he thinks fit; and it would be as absurd for us to dispute this, as for the clay to quarrel with the potter. But he always goes by fixed rules of justice and goodness. When God is coming against us in judgments, we may be sure it is for our sins; but sincere conversion from the evil of sin will prevent the evil of punishment, as to persons, and to families, and nations.</body></html>
