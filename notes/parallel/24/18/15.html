The words "the ancient paths," literally, <span class= "ital">the paths of the age, </span>or <span class= "ital">of eternity, </span>are in apposition with "their ways," and point to the old immemorial faith of the patriarchs, a faith not of to-day or yesterday. The second "paths" is a different word from the first, and implies rather the "by-ways," as contrasted with the "way cast up," the raised causeway, the "king's highway," on which a man could not well lose his way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because my people hath forgotten me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Surely</span>, etc.; or better still, <span class="accented">Yet surely</span>. It is not uncommon for a particle of asseveration to acquire a contrasting force from the context; see e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>; and, still more completely parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>, where Authorized Version, with substantial correctness, has "nevertheless." Israel "forgot" Jehovah (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a>); no doubt he was responsible for so doing, but still it was not "of malice preponse." <span class="cmt_word">To vanity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the unreal idol-gods. <span class="cmt_word">And they have caused them to stumble</span>; viz. the idol-gods; these are responsible (.for they have a real existence in the consciousness of their worshippers) for this interruption of Israel's spiritual progress (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In their ways from the ancient paths.</span> "From," however, is interpolated by the Authorized Version; the Hebrew places "the ancient <span class="accented">paths"</span> <span class="accented">in</span> apposition to "their ways," "Stand ye in the ways," Jeremiah cried at an earlier period, "and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>). These "old" or "ancient" paths were ideally "their ways," the ways appointed for the Jews to walk in. <span class="cmt_word">To walk in paths</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in tracks</span>, footpaths leading up and down and often ending in nothing; or, in other terms, <span class="cmt_word">in a way not cast up</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3, 4</a>, gives a graphic picture of the operation of "casting up a way"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:11-17 Sinners call it liberty to live at large; whereas for a man to be a slave to his lusts, is the very worst slavery. They forsook God for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising. But what will they do in the day of judgment!</body></html>
