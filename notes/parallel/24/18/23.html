The words might seem, at first, to refer specially to the conspiracy of the men of Anathoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:">Jeremiah 11:21</a>), but by this time, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm" title="Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.">Jeremiah 18:18</a> shows, the hatred provoked by the warnings of the prophet had spread further, and united the priests and false prophets of Jerusalem in a common hostility against him. So afterwards, in the Gospel history, the conspiracies that began at Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>) were developed in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-1.htm" title="When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:">Matthew 27:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Deal thus with them.</span>--The interpolated word "thus," intended to emphasise the prayer, really weakens it: <span class= "ital">in the. time of Thine anger deal with them, </span>as implying that the day of grace was past, that nothing now remained but retribution. The prayer was the utterance of an indignation, not unrighteous in itself, yet showing all too plainly, as has been said above, like the language of the so-called imprecatory Psalms, the contrast between the Jewish and the Christian and Christ-like way of meeting wrong and hatred. For us such prayers are among the things that have passed away, and we have learnt to admire and imitate the nobler temper of the proto-martyr, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a>). The New Testament utterances of St. Peter against Simon the sorcerer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.">Acts 8:20</a>), of St. Paul against Ananias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>), the Judaisers of Galatia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm" title="As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel to you than that you have received, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:9</a>), and Alexander the coppersmith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2Timothy 4:14</a>), present an apparent parallelism; but the words spoken in these cases have more the character of an authoritative judicial sentence.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them be overthrown before thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> count them as those who have been brought to ruin. This explanation seems required by the parallelism, the companion clause meaning "<span class="accented">do</span> not regard their sin as cancelled." The ruin may be either spiritual or temporal; the parallelism favors the former (comp. ver. 14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14.htm">Hosea 14</a>:10, where "fall" should be "stumble"). <span class="cmt_word">Deal thus with them</span>.

But the prophet had done his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicing in a day of evil.</body></html>
