deal thus with them in the time of your anger.">Jeremiah 18:23</a>). We are reminded of the oft-recurring statement in the Gospels that priests and elders "took counsel" against our Lord to "put Him to death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-14.htm" title="Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.">Matthew 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-1.htm" title="When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:">Matthew 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-11.htm" title="And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.">Luke 6:11</a>; <span class= "ital">et al</span>.)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">For the law shall not perish . . .</span>--The words meant apparently (1) that they had enough guidance in the Law, in the priests, and in the prophets who met their wishes, and (2) that they might trust in the continuance of that guidance in spite of the threatenings of destruction that the prophet had just spoken. The words are suggestive as showing the precise nature of the guidance expected from each. The priests interpret the Law, the wise give the counsel of experience, the prophet speaks what claims to be the word, or message, of the Lord. A striking parallel is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm" title="Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.">Ezekiel 7:26</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Come, and let us smite him with the tongue.</span>--We probably find the result of the conspiracy in the measures taken by Pashur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/20-1.htm" title="Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.">Jeremiah 20:1-3</a>. He had "heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things," and we may well believe that his informants were some of those who thus announced their intentions. There is no sufficient reason for the marginal reading, "for the tongue."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-23.</span> - A fresh conspiracy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-18.htm">Jeremiah 11:18</a>), called forth by the preceding discourse; Jeremiah's prayer. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The law</span> - or rather, <span class="accented">direction</span>, instruction, which was a special function of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9-11</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">shall not perish from the priest</span>. The Jews were but obeying the Deuteronomic Law (on which Jeremiah, as we have seen, laid so much stress) in alluding to the priests. Unhappily, the priests in Jeremiah's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>), as in Isaiah's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>), were forgetful of their high mission. <span class="cmt_word">Nor counsel from the wise</span>. The wise men formed an important order in Jewish society, the importance of which in the Divine education of Israel has not been sufficiently recognized. It was their custom to sit in public places, generally in the chambered recess in the city gate, and give advice on questions of moral practice to those who applied for it. But there were wise men and wise men. Some appear, to have "mocked" at the earnest preaching of the prophets (hence the solemn rebukes in the Book of Proverbs), others to have as it were prepared the way for the latter by a more or less distinct recognition of the religious foundation of morality, and of these we have ample monuments in the canonical Proverbs. There may also have been other shades and varieties of wise men, for their characteristic was not a faculty of intuition, but rather of reflectively applying fundamental moral principles. One highly esteemed branch of "wisdom" would, of course, be political, and this would be the most liable to perversion. It is of such (Proverbs 29:14). <span class="cmt_word">Nor the word from the prophet</span>. "The word" is a general term for prophesying. Of course, the speakers take no account of the advance in prophecy from the time, at any rate, of Amos. They are satisfied with the lower order of prophets ("false prophets," as the Septuagint calls them); but still they are afraid of Jeremiah, much as Balak was afraid of Balaam, when that soothsayer was blessing Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Smite him with the tongue; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by slanderous accusations</span>. The same figure as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3, 8</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the people devised devices against him. Thus do sinners deal with the great Intercessor, crucifying him afresh, and speaking against him on earth, while his blood is speaking for them in heaven. But the prophet had done his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicing in a day of evil.</body></html>
