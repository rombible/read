To what extent they were the utterances of a righteous indignation, a true zeal for God, which had not yet learnt the higher lesson of patience and forgiveness, or embodied an element of personal vindictiveness, we are not called on to inquire, and could not, in any case, decide. It is not ours to judge another man's servant. In all like cases we have to remember that the very truthfulness with which the prayer is recorded is at least a proof that the prophet felt, like Jonah, that he did well to be angry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-9.htm" title="And God said to Jonah, Do you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.">Jonah 4:9</a>), that a righteous anger is at least one step towards a righteous love, and that we, as disciples of Christ, have passed, or ought to have passed, beyond that earlier stage.<p><span class= "bld">Pour out their blood by the force of the sword.</span>--Literally, with a bolder metaphor, <span class= "ital">pour them out into the hands of the sword.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pour out their blood by the force</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">spill them into the hands</span> of, etc. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10</a>); a phrase akin to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. The sword is personified. <span class="cmt_word">Let their men he put to death</span>; another personification, for the Hebrew has "slain of Death" - pestilence is referred to, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the people devised devices against him. Thus do sinners deal with the great Intercessor, crucifying him afresh, and speaking against him on earth, while his blood is speaking for them in heaven. But the prophet had done his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicing in a day of evil.</body></html>
