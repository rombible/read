The language (in part a reproduction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm" title="But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and my eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away captive.">Jeremiah 13:17</a>) is all but identical with that which recurs again and again in the Lamentations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm" title="And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm" title="Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.">Jeremiah 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm" title="And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?">Jeremiah 2:18</a>), and may be looked upon as the germ of which those elegies of woe were the development.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-21.</span> - The prophet's grief, and second intercession. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore thou shalt say,</span> etc. There is something strange and contrary to verisimilitude in the prefixing of this formula, not to a Divine revelation, but to a mere expression of the pained human feelings of the prophet. It is possible that the editor of Jeremiah's prophecies thought the paragraph which begins here needed something to link it with the preceding passage, and selected his formula rather unsuitably. <span class="cmt_word">Let mine eyes run down</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>). Jeremiah's tender compassion shows itself in his choice of the expression, <span class="cmt_word">the virgin daughter of my people</span>, just as we feel an added bitterness in the premature death of a cherished maiden. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:17-22 Jeremiah acknowledged his own sins, and those of the people, but pleaded with the Lord to remember his covenant. In their distress none of the idols of the Gentiles could help them, nor could the heavens give rain of themselves. The Lord will always have a people to plead with him at his mercy-seat. He will heal every truly repenting sinner. Should he not see fit to hear our prayers on behalf of our guilty land, he will certainly bless with salvation all who confess their sins and seek his mercy.</body></html>
