and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end thereof?">Jeremiah 5:31</a> a glimpse of the evil influence of the great body of the prophetic order; and now the true prophet feels more bitterly than ever the misery of having to contend against it. The colleges or schools of the prophets had rapidly degenerated from their first ideal, and had become (as the Mendicant Orders did in the history of mediaeval Christendom) corrupt, ambitious, seekers after popularity. So Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/3-8.htm" title="But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.">Micah 3:8-11</a>), whose words were yet fresh in the memories of men (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm" title="Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.">Jeremiah 26:18</a>), had spoken sharp words of the growing evil. So Ezekiel through one whole chapter (Jeremiah 13) inveighs against the guilt of the prophets, male or female, who followed their own spirit, and had seen no true vision.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall not see . . .</span>--To the eye of Jeremiah the future was clear. The sins of the people must lead to shame, defeat, and exile. Out of that discipline, but only through that, they might return with a better mind to better days. The false prophets took the easier and more popular line of predicting victory and "assured peace" (literally, <span class= "ital">peace of truth, </span>i.e., <span class= "ital">true peace</span>) for the people and their city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - "Pleading with Providence, the good prophet lays the blame on ill teaching, but the stern answer (Ver. 14), admitting the plea as true, rejects it as inadequate (Ver. 14), and denounces sorrows which (Vers. 17-22) the prophet passionately deprecates" (Rowland Williams). <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God!</span> rather, <span class="accented">Alas! O Lord Jehovah</span> (see on Jeremiah 1:6). <span class="cmt_word">The prophets say unto them</span>. The greater part of the prophetic order had not kept pace with its more spiritual members (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.). They still traded on those natural gifts of divination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>) which were, no doubt, where genuine, of Divine origin, but which, even then, needed to be supplemented and controlled by a special impulse from the Spirit of holiness. Jeremiah, however, declares, on the authority of a revelation, that these prophets did not divine by any God-given faculty, but "the deceit of their own heart" (Ver. 14). The Deuteronomic <span class="accented">Torah</span>, discovered after a period of concealment at the outset of Jeremiah's ministry, energetically forbids the practice of the art of divination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:10-16 The Lord calls the Jews this people, not his people. They had forsaken his service, therefore he would punish them according to their sins. He forbade Jeremiah to plead for them. The false prophets were the most criminal. The Lord pronounces condemnation on them; but as the people loved to have it so, they were not to escape judgments. False teachers encourage men to expect peace and salvation, without repentance, faith, conversion, and holiness of life. But those who believe a lie must not plead if for an excuse. They shall feel what they say they will not fear.</body></html>
