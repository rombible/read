The time of pardon has not yet come. The prophet is told that <span class= "ital">now </span>(the adverb is emphasised) is the time for remembering iniquity and visiting sins. The latter half of the verse is a verbal quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-13.htm" title="They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepts them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.">Hosea 8:13</a>. The opening word "thus" appears to point back to the "many backslidings" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-7.htm" title="O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do you it for your name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.">Jeremiah 14:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-16.</span> - The answer of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus have they loved to wander, ... therefore the Lord doth not accept them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with such pertinacity have they been set upon "wandering" (roving lawlessly about), that the Lord hath no more pleasure in them. "Therefore," is, literally, <span class="accented">and</span>. "Thus," or "so," is used in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>, which runs literally, "... there came not so [abundantly] among timber." The particle of comparison has given much occupation to the commentators (see Payne Smith's note), but the above view is at once simple and suitable to the context; for Jeremiah has already admitted that "our backslidings are multiplied" (Ver. 7). <span class="accented">The Lord doth not</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. (to the end of the verse), is quoted <span class="accented">verbatim</span> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>. Jeremiah puts conspicuous honor on the older inspired writers; he has no craving for originality. Nearly all has been said already; what he has to do is chiefly to adapt and to apply, <span class="cmt_word">He will now remember</span>, etc. The emphasis is on "now" Nothing is more remarkable in the prophets than the stress laid on the unerring justness of the time chosen for Divine interpositions. When the iniquity is fully ripe, it as it were attracts the punishment, which till then is laid up in store (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:10-16 The Lord calls the Jews this people, not his people. They had forsaken his service, therefore he would punish them according to their sins. He forbade Jeremiah to plead for them. The false prophets were the most criminal. The Lord pronounces condemnation on them; but as the people loved to have it so, they were not to escape judgments. False teachers encourage men to expect peace and salvation, without repentance, faith, conversion, and holiness of life. But those who believe a lie must not plead if for an excuse. They shall feel what they say they will not fear.</body></html>
