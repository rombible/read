<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-4.htm" title="Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.">Judges 17:4</a>, compared with 5, 12), in the Hebrew interchangeable. The epithet indicated his birth in Moresheth-gath in Philistia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm" title="Therefore shall you give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.">Micah 1:14</a>). As Micah had prophesied under Jotham and Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.">Micah 1:1</a>), the prediction here referred to must have been delivered towards the close of his ministry. The words cited are from <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>, and immediately precede the prediction of an ultimate restoration of Judah in the last days in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-2</a>, which we find in identical terms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>. Here, then, was a case, is the implied argument of the elders, in which a threat did its work, and therefore was not fulfilled. It did good, and not evil. The phrase "mountain of the house" is not found elsewhere in Jeremiah as a description of the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Micah the Morasthite</span>, etc. The "elders" appeal for a precedent to the case of Micah (called after his native place, Moresheth-Gath, to distinguish him from other Micahs), who had been equally explicit in his declarations of woe to Jerusalem, without incurring the charge <span class="accented">of</span> blasphemy. The prediction referred to is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>, the form of which agrees verbally with our passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.</body></html>
