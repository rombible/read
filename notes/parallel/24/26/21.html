The flight into Egypt presents a parallel to that of Jeroboam <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-40.htm" title="Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.">1Kings 11:40</a>), Hadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-18.htm" title="And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.">1Kings 11:18</a>), and Joseph and Mary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/2-13.htm" title="And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be you there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.">Matthew 2:13-15</a>). Egypt was at all times the natural asylum for political refugees from Judaea. The presence of the deposed Jehoahaz and of other Jews in Egypt may possibly have been an attraction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.">2Chronicles 36:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm" title="And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus said the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:">Jeremiah 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,">Jeremiah 44:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His mighty men</span>. The "mighty men" (<span class="accented">gibborim</span>) are not mentioned again in Jeremiah, and the Septuagint omits the word. But it is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a> that the "mighty men" were recognized as an important part of the community. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a> it appears that the term indicates a position of high command in the army, which is in accordance with the notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Went into Egypt</span>. Egypt was the natural refuge for a native of Palestine (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-17.htm">1 Kings 11:17, 40</a> Matt, 2:14), just as Palestine was for a native of Egypt. The latter, however, proved to be not a safe asylum for Urijah, as Pharaoh was the liege lord of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>), and the extradition of Urijah as a criminal naturally followed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.</body></html>
