The threat of the men of Anathoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:">Jeremiah 11:21</a>) is repeated by the priests and prophets of Jerusalem. They look on Jeremiah as one who has incurred the condemnation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-20.htm" title="But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Had made an end of speaking</span>. They allowed Jeremiah to finish his discourse (of which we have here only the briefest summary), either from a lingering reverence for his person and office, or to obtain fuller materials for an accusation (comp. the trial of Stephen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the people</span>. The "people" appear to have been always under some constraint. As long as the priests and prophets were alone, they dominated the unofficial classes, but when the princes appeared (ver. 11), the new influence proved superior. In ver. 16 princes and people together go over to the side of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die</span>. Death was the legal penalty both for blasphemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>) and for presuming to prophesy without having received a prophetic revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). Jeremiah's declaration ran so entirely counter to the prejudices of his hearers that he may well have been accused of both these sins, or crimes. True, Isaiah and Amos had already predicted the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1, 2</a>); but it may have been contended that the timely repentance of Judah under Hezekiah and Josiah had effectually cancelled the threatened doom, and though <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a> evidently refers to a time later than Josiah, and represents the ruin of Jerusalem as practically certain, it would seem that the prophetic book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.) to which this belongs (to say the least) was not generally known. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:7-15 The priests and prophets charged Jeremiah as deserving death, and bore false witness against him. The elders of Israel came to inquire into this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him to prophesy thus. As long as ministers keep close to the word they have from God, they need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain of ministers for preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desire to bring them to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of their danger if they go on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, or put to death, or to show hatred to their faithful reprovers, will hasten and increase their own punishment.</body></html>
