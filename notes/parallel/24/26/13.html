The whole history reminds us of the accusation brought against One greater than Jeremiah. He had foretold a destruction of the Second Temple as complete as that of Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-44.htm" title="And shall lay you even with the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone on another; because you knew not the time of your visitation.">Luke 19:44</a>). He, too, was accused of having said that He would destroy the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>). And He, foreseeing that the people would not repent, had pronounced, though not publicly, a sentence on the Temple which succeeded that against which Jeremiah had prophesied, which was irrevocable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-2.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.">Matthew 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-2.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, See you these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.">Mark 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-44.htm" title="And shall lay you even with the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone on another; because you knew not the time of your visitation.">Luke 19:44</a>).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:7-15 The priests and prophets charged Jeremiah as deserving death, and bore false witness against him. The elders of Israel came to inquire into this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him to prophesy thus. As long as ministers keep close to the word they have from God, they need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain of ministers for preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desire to bring them to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of their danger if they go on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, or put to death, or to show hatred to their faithful reprovers, will hasten and increase their own punishment.</body></html>
