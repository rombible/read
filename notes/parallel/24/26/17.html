The elders speaking in the time of Jehoiakim (cir. B.C. 608) remembered the tradition of what had passed, a century or so before, in the reign of Hezekiah (B.C. 726-698), and could appeal to it as a precedent in favour of the prophet. The word for "assembly" (elsewhere rendered "congregation") corresponds to the <span class= "ital">Ecclesia </span>of a Greek city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The elders of the land</span> add their voice in favor of Jeremiah, not, however, without first of all consulting the people whose representatives they are. The whole verse is thoroughly technical in its phraseology. The word (<span class="accented">qahal</span>) rendered "assembly" is the traditional legal term for the "congregation of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-30.htm">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>); comp. ver. 9, where the verb is the corresponding one to <span class="accented">qahal</span>. Thus, with all the faults of the government of Judah, which Jeremiah himself reveals to us, it was very far removed from the Oriental despotisms of our day. The "elders" are still an important element in the social system, and form a link with that earlier period in which the family was the leading power in the social organization. Originally the term denoted, strictly and in the full sense, heads of families; they have their analogue in the councils of the Aryan village communities. "References to their parliamentary status (if the phrase may be used) occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>.

We find another reference to their quasi-judicial authority in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-2.htm">Deuteronomy 21:2</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.</body></html>
