Shaphan, the father, was prominent as a scribe in the reformation of Josiah (cir. A.D. 624). He superintended the restoration of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm" title="Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.">2Chronicles 34:8</a>). To him Hilkiah the priest gave the book of the Law which had been found in the house of the Lord, and Shaphan took it to the king. He took his son Ahikam with him when he was sent to consult the prophetess Huldah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,">2Kings 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-20.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,">2Chronicles 34:20</a>). Here the son meets us, true to the early lessons of his life, as the protector of the prophet, whose work rested so largely on the impression made by the Book of the Law thus discovered. A brother of Ahikam, Gemariah, appears in a like character in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>. After the conquest of the land by Nebuchadnezzar, Jeremiah finds refuge with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-6.htm" title="Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelled with him among the people that were left in the land.">Jeremiah 40:6</a>), who had been made, apparently through the prophet's influence, satrap, or governor, of the lands under the Chaldaean king; and he, after a fruitless warning, falls a victim to the conspiracy of the princes of the royal house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/41-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.">Jeremiah 41:1-2</a>). Here stress is laid on the fact of Ahikam's protection, as showing how it was that Jeremiah escaped the fate which fell on Urijah.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span> the hand of Ahi-kant, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in spite of the prepossession against prophets like Jeremiah which this incident reveals, Ahikam threw all his influence into the scale of toleration.' The same Ahikam is mentioned in circumstances which reflect credit on his religion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12-14</a>. One of his sons, Gemariah, lent Baruch his official room for the reading of the prophecies of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>); another was the well-known Gedaliah, who became governor of Judah after the fall of Jerusalem, and who was himself friendly to Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.</body></html>
