There is no special record of the repentance thus referred to, but it is quite in accord with Hezekiah's general character, as seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/29-6.htm" title="For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.">2Chronicles 29:6-10</a> (which may be the occasion referred to) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-26.htm" title="Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not on them in the days of Hezekiah.">2Chronicles 32:26</a>. The whole tone of the advice of "old experience," approximating to something like "prophetic strain," in this case, reminds us of the counsels of Gamaliel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35-39</a>. The closing words, "Thus might we procure great evil to our souls," present an exact parallel to "lest haply we be found even to fight against God." The result of the counsel thus given is left to be inferred. It obviously left the prophet free to continue his work as a preacher, though probably under a kind of police surveillance, like that implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/36-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 36:1-5</a>. The favourable result is attributed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a> to the influence of Ahikam.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus might we procure</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and we are about to commit a great evil against our souls</span> (not merely "against ourselves").

Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.</body></html>
