So, for "battlements" it is better to read <span class= "ital">branches </span>(as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm" title="For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.">Isaiah 18:5</a>), as carrying on the same imagery, and indicating the limits of the destruction, that is not to make a "full end." The rendering "walls," still adopted by some commentators, may refer to the "walls" of a vineyard, but the second word would in that case be the <span class= "ital">tendrils </span>of the vine. Both the palm-tree and the vine appear on Maccabean coins as symbols of Judah, and the latter had been treated as such in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/80-8.htm" title="You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it.">Psalm 80:8-16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-18.</span> - Provoked by the open unbelief of the men of Judah, Jehovah repeats his warning of a sore judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her walls</span>. There is a doubt about "walls," which should, as some think, rather be <span class="accented">vine-rows</span> (a change of points is involved; also of shin into sin - the slightest of all changes), or shoots, or branches (comparing the Syriac). The figure would thus gain somewhat in symmetry. However, all the ancient interpreters (whose authority, overrated by some, still counts for something) explain the word as in the Authorized Version, and, as Graf remarks, in order to destroy the vines, it' would be necessary to climb up upon the walls of the vineyard. (For the figure of the vine or the vineyard, scrap, on Jeremiah 2:21.) <span class="cmt_word">Take away... not the Lord's</span>. The Septuagint and Peshito read differently, translating "leave her foundations, for they are the <span class="accented">Lord's"</span> (supposing the figure be taken from a building). As the text stands, it is better to change <span class="cmt_word">battlements</span> into <span class="accented">tendrils</span>. Judah's degenerate members are to be removed, but the vine-stock, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>., the behooving kernel of the nation, is to be left. It is the key-note of the "remnant" which Jeremiah again strikes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:10-18 Multitudes are ruined by believing that God will not be so strict as his word says he will; by this artifice Satan undid mankind. Sinners are not willing to own any thing to be God's word, that tends to part them from, or to disquiet them in, their sins. Mocking and misusing the Lord's messengers, filled the measure of their iniquity. God can bring trouble upon us from places and causes very remote. He has mercy in store for his people, therefore will set bounds to this desolating judgment. Let us not overlook the nevertheless, ver. 18. This is the Lord's covenant with Israel. He thereby proclaims his holiness, and his utter displeasure against sin while sparing the sinner, Ps 89:30-35.</body></html>
