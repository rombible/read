and this, as heightening the enormity of the sin that follows, gives a better sense than the English version, which follows the marginal reading of the Hebrew. The latter finds its parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-6.htm" title="According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.">Hosea 13:6</a>. There is probably an implied reference to the covenant to which the people had sworn in the time of Josiah.<p><span class= "bld">Houses.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">house. </span>The singular is, perhaps, used because the prophet thinks primarily of the idol's temple as the scene of the adulteress's guilt, which here, as elsewhere, is the symbol of national apostasy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How... for this?</span> rather, Why <span class="accented">should I pardon thee? <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy children</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. (since "the daughter of Zion" is equivalent to Zion regarded as an ideal entity) the members of the Jewish people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, "the children of thy people"). <span class="cmt_word">When I had fed them to the full.</span> So Ewald, following the versions and many manuscripts (there is no marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible). This gives a good sense, and may be supported by ver. 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>. But the reading of the received Hebrew text, though somewhat more difficult, is yet perfectly capable of explanation; and, slight as the difference is in the reading adopted by Ewald (it involves a mere shade of pronunciation), it is not to be preferred to the received reading. Read, therefore, <span class="accented">though -r made them to swear</span> (<span class="accented">allegiance</span>),<span class="accented">!let they committed adultery</span>. The oath may be that of Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>.), or such au oath as had been recently taken by Josiah and the people (1 Kings 23:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-31.htm">2 Chronicles 34:31, 32</a>). The "adultery" may be taken both in a literal and in a figurative sense, and so also the "harlots' houses" in the next clause. It is also well worthy of consideration whether the prophet may not be referring to certain matrimonial customs handed down from remote antiquity and arising from the ancient system of kinship through women (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 None could be found who behaved as upright and godly men. But the Lord saw the true character of the people through all their disguises. The poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. What can be expected but works of darkness, from people that know nothing of God and religion? There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty, know the way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these were willingly ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse. The rich were insolent and haughty, and the abuse of God's favours made their sin worse.</body></html>
