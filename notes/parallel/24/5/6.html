The three forms of animal ferocity, lion, wolf, leopard--representing, perhaps, the three phases of simple fierceness, ravenousness, and cunning; possibly even three oppressors in whom those attributes were to be impersonated--are brought together to embody the cruelty of the invader. The three animals were all common in Palestine, but it seems a weak rendering of the prophet's words to take them literally as simply predicting that the land would be ravaged by the beasts of prey.<p><span class= "bld">A wolf of the evenings.</span>--Better, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">of the deserts; </span>but the term "evening," as applied to the habits of the beast of prey prowling in the darkness, is supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm" title="Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.">Zephaniah 3:3</a>. The same three animals appear in the symbolism of the first canto of Dante's <span class= "ital">Inferno, </span>and the coincidence can hardly be thought of as accidental.<p><span class= "bld">A leopard shall watch . . .</span>--There is no adequate reason for substituting "panther." The leopard finds its place in the <span class= "ital">Fauna </span>of Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-7.htm" title="Therefore I will be to them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:">Hosea 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>).

That the poet had Jeremiah in his mind cannot be doubted. The deep knowledge of the Scriptures possessed by medieval theologians (and such was Dante) may put many Protestants to shame. Curiously enough, whereas the early commentators on Dante interpret these wild beasts of vices, the moderns find historical references to nations. On the other hand, while modern expositors explain Jeremiah's wild beasts as symbols of calamities, Rashi and St. Jerome understand them of the Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks. <span class="cmt_word">A lion out of the forest.</span> The first of a series of figures for the cruel invaders of Judah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>). The frequent references (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a>) show how common the lion was in the hills and valleys of the land of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">A wolf of the evenings</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a wolf which goes out to seek for prey in the evening. So the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate (comp. "wolves of the evening," <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>). But there is no evidence that '<span class="accented">erebh</span>, evening, has for its plural '<span class="accented">arabhoth</span>, which is, in fact, the regular plural of <span class="accented">arabah</span>, <span class="accented">desert</span>. Render, therefore, <span class="accented">a wolf of the deserts</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. one which has its den in the deserts, and falls upon the cultivated parts when it is hungry. Luther, "the wolf out of the desert." A leopard; rather, <span class="accented">a panther</span>. The Chaldeans are compared to this animal, on account of its swiftness, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 None could be found who behaved as upright and godly men. But the Lord saw the true character of the people through all their disguises. The poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. What can be expected but works of darkness, from people that know nothing of God and religion? There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty, know the way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these were willingly ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse. The rich were insolent and haughty, and the abuse of God's favours made their sin worse.</body></html>
