Looking upon the masses that toil for bread, those whom the Scribes afterwards called the "people of earth," it was not strange that they who had been left untaught should have learnt so little. The thought finds a parallel in our Lord's compassion for the multitude who were as "sheep having no shepherd" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm" title="But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.">Matthew 9:36</a>), for the servant who "knew not his Lord's will" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.

In fact, it was only after the return from Babylon that any popular schools were founded in Judaea, and not till shortly before the destruction of the temple that the elementary instruction attained the regularity of a system (Edersheim, 'Sketches of Jewish Social Life in the Time of Christ,' pp. 134, 135). <span class="cmt_word">The judgment of their God</span>. A similar phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>. "Judgment (<span class="accented">mishpat</span>) here (as in some other passages) has acquired a technical sense. This may be illustrated by the corresponding word in Arabic (<span class="accented">din</span>), which means <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> obedience, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a religion, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a statute or ordinance, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a system of usages, rites, and ceremonies" (Lane's 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.). Judgment is, therefore, here equivalent to "religious law," and "law" is a preferable rendering. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 None could be found who behaved as upright and godly men. But the Lord saw the true character of the people through all their disguises. The poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. What can be expected but works of darkness, from people that know nothing of God and religion? There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty, know the way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these were willingly ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse. The rich were insolent and haughty, and the abuse of God's favours made their sin worse.</body></html>
