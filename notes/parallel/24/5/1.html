2 Chronicles 34, 35, as one of thorough reformation. It is, of course, possible that parts of the picture may have been worked up when the prophecies were rewritten under Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-32.htm" title="Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides to them many like words.">Jeremiah 36:32</a>); but, on the other hand, it is equally possible that the prophet may have seen even at the time how hollow and incomplete that reformation was. The form in which he utters his conviction reminds one of the old story of the Greek sage, Diogenes, appearing in the streets of Athens with a lantern, searching for an honest man. In the thought that the pardon of the city depended on its containing some elements of good which might make reformation possible, we find an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>; but the picture is of a state more utterly hopeless. There were not ten righteous men found in Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-32.htm" title="And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.">Genesis 18:32</a>); in Jerusalem there was not one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - Gladly would Jehovah pardon, if his people showed but a gleam of sound morality. But they are all deaf to the warning voice - the Law of God is flagrantly violated. In particular the marriage tie, as well the typical one between man and woman as the anti-typical between the people and its God, is openly disregarded (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye can find a man</span>. "A man" is explained by the following clauses. It is a man whose practice and whose aims are right, of whom Jeremiah, like Diogenes with his lantern, is in search. (It is evident that the prophet speaks rhetorically, for himself and his disciples, however few, were doubtless "men" in the prophetic sense of the word.) <span class="cmt_word">Judgment... the truth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">justice</span>... <span class="accented">good faith</span>, the primary virtues of civil society. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 None could be found who behaved as upright and godly men. But the Lord saw the true character of the people through all their disguises. The poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. What can be expected but works of darkness, from people that know nothing of God and religion? There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty, know the way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these were willingly ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse. The rich were insolent and haughty, and the abuse of God's favours made their sin worse.</body></html>
