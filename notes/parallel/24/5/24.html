The whole period from October to March has that character. The "early" rains are those that come in autumn, the latter those which close the season in spring. The former argument in what we may call the prophet's natural theology had been drawn from the presence of law in the midst of what seemed the lawless elements of nature. Now he urges that drawn from regularity of succession. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-22.htm" title="While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.">Genesis 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm" title="Fire, and hail; snow, and vapors; stormy wind fulfilling his word:">Psalm 148:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Rain, both the former and the latter.</span>--Again a Deuteronomic phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm" title="That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>). Compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">James 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm" title="In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.">Proverbs 16:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The appointed weeks of the harvest.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the weeks, the statutes, </span>or <span class= "ital">ordinances, of the harvest, </span>the seven weeks included between the beginning of the barley harvest at the Passover and the completion of the wheat harvest at Pentecost.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That giveth rain,</span> etc. The second appeal is to the regularity of the rains. Dr. Robinson remarks that there are not at the present day in Palestine "any particular periods of rain, or succession of showers, which might be regarded as distinct rainy seasons," and that...unless there has been some change m the climate of Palestine, the former and the latter rains seem to correspond to "the first showers of autumn, which revived the parched and thirsty earth and prepared it for the seed, and the later showers of spring, which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and the vernal products of the fields" ('Biblical Researches,' 3:98). <span class="cmt_word">He reserveth unto us</span>, etc.; literally, he <span class="accented">keepeth for us the weeks - the statutes of harvest</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the weeks which are the appointed conditions of harvest. The prophet means the seven weeks which elapsed from the second day of the Passover to the "Feast of Harvest," or "Feast of Weeks" (Pentecost) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9, 10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:19-31 Unhumbled hearts are ready to charge God with being unjust in their afflictions. But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.</body></html>
