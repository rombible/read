The Authorized Version certainly gives apart of the meaning. The Hebrew word rendered "mighty" ('<span class="accented">ethan</span>), rather, "perennial," is the epithet of rocks and mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>); of a pasture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>); of rivers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a>).

Does not this aptly convey the impression which a long-civilized nation (and the Jews, who have been called "rude," were only so by comparison with the Egyptians and Assyrians) must derive from the tumultuous incursions of nomad hosts?

Sinners are not willing to own any thing to be God's word, that tends to part them from, or to disquiet them in, their sins. Mocking and misusing the Lord's messengers, filled the measure of their iniquity. God can bring trouble upon us from places and causes very remote. He has mercy in store for his people, therefore will set bounds to this desolating judgment. Let us not overlook the nevertheless, ver. 18. This is the Lord's covenant with Israel. He thereby proclaims his holiness, and his utter displeasure against sin while sparing the sinner, Ps 89:30-35.</body></html>
