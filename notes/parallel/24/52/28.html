It presents some difficulties in detail. (1) The date given here, the "seventh year" of Nebuchadnezzar, does not agree with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm" title="And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.">2Kings 24:12</a>, which gives the "eighth year" as the time of the first deportation after the defeat of Jehoiachin. (2) The number of the captives then carried into exile, given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2Kings 24:14</a> at 10,000, besides the craftsmen and the smiths, is given here as 3,023. The precision of the number seems to imply reference to a register or record of some kind, and so far bears <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>evidence of accuracy. Probably the word "ten" has dropped out before "seven," and we have here the record of a second deportation in the <span class= "ital">seventeenth </span>year of Nebuchadnezzar, while the siege of Jerusalem was going on, and made up in part of prisoners taken in skirmishes, and partly of the numerous Jews who "fell away to the Chaldaeans" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the seventh year.</span> As Ewald and Keil agree, we should correct "seventh" into "seventeenth" (just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, for "eight" we should read "eighteen"). On the small number of Jews deported Ewald remarks, "Nothing so clearly shows the extent to which the best men from the upper classes had been already despatched by the Chaldeans across the Euphrates, as the fact that in all the years of the second, and, if it be insisted on, of the third revolt, put together, they found only 4600 men more whom they thought worth the trouble of transporting" ('History of Israel,' 4:265). As to the third deportation, see on Jeremiah 41:1. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>52:24-30 The leaders of the Jews caused them to err; but now they are, in particular, made monuments of Divine justice. Here is an account of two earlier captivities. This people often were wonders both of judgment and mercy.</body></html>
