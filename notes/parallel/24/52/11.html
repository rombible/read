The word for "prison" is a peculiar one, and differs from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>. Literally it means "house of visitation," and this may imply either stricter custody, or more severe punishment in addition to imprisonment. The LXX. renders it by "house of the mill," as though Zedekiah, after he had been blinded, had been made to do slave work like that of Samson. Possibly this was merely an inference from <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-13.htm" title="They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.">Lamentations 5:13</a>. Such treatment of captive kings was, however, quite in keeping with the character of Assyrian and Chaldaean rulers. Thus Assur-bani-pal boasts that he placed a king of Arabia in chains, and bound him with the dogs, and caused him to be kept in one of the great gates of Nineveh (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. p. 93). So Darius, in the <span class= "ital">Behistun </span>inscription, boasts of having taken a rebel king of Sagartia, cut off his nose and ears, and kept him chained at his door (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. p. 119).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In prison;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the house of custody.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>52:1-11 This fruit of sin we should pray against above any thing; Cast me not away from thy presence, Ps 51:11.
