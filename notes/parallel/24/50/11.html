The English version has, however, the support of the LXX. and Vulg.<p><span class= "bld">And bellow as bulls.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">thou didst neigh as strong steeds. </span>The verb is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-8.htm" title="They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbor's wife.">Jeremiah 5:8</a>, the noun the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm" title="The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.">Jeremiah 8:16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-20.</span> - Babylon's desolation and Israel's glorification. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because ye were glad,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">Truly ye may be glad</span>; <span class="accented">truly ye may rejoice, ye spoilers of mine heritage</span>; <span class="accented">truly ye may leap as a heifer at grass, and neigh as steeds</span>; <span class="accented">yet your mother</span>, etc. Your triumph shall be of short duration; disgrace follows closely upon its heels. "Your mother" is a term for the nation regarded as a whole (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>). "At grass" is the reading adopted by the Septuagint and Vulgate; the pointed text has (the vowels alone are different), "(a heifer) that thresheth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> allowed to eat its fill of corn, agreeably to the direction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>.

The cause of this destruction is the wrath of the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hath sinned against the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God's judgments. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture. All who return to God and their duty, shall find satisfaction of soul in so doing. Deliverances out of trouble are comforts indeed, when fruits of the forgiveness of sin.</body></html>
