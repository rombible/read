In the original text the form of the two words must have been identical, as the vowel-points were of later introduction. The editors of the present text were probably guided by the thought that the context in this case determined the meaning of the word as meaning "drought," and not a "sword." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-22.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.">Deuteronomy 28:22</a> the text of the Authorised version gives "sword," and the margin "drought." There is, however, a certain loss of rhetorical emphasis in the change of the word with which the three previous verses had begun. The "waters" include the canals of Babylon as well as the Euphrates.<p><span class= "bld">They are mad upon their idols.</span>--The word for "idols" means literally "terrors," or "objects of terror," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-16.htm" title="Your fierce wrath goes over me; your terrors have cut me off.">Psalm 88:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-25.htm" title="It is drawn, and comes out of the body; yes, the glittering sword comes out of his gall: terrors are on him.">Job 20:25</a>, and this is the only place in which it is used of the objects of worship. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/2-10.htm" title="The Emims dwelled therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;">Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a> it appears as the name of the Emim, probably as meaning "the terrible, <span class= "ital">or </span>gigantic ones." Here it seems used for the colossal figures--winged bulls, human-headed lions, and the like--which were the objects of Babylonian worship. (See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm" title="Your terribleness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A drought.</span> The Maasoretic critics, in their prosaic realism, were unable to see how a "sword" could be "upon the waters;" hence they altered <span class="accented">khereb</span> into <span class="accented">khoreb.</span> But the sword is merely a symbol of the Divine vengeance, and may be interpreted differently according to the exigencies of the context. Render, <span class="accented">Sword upon the waters</span>. <span class="cmt_word">They are mad upon their idols;</span> rather, <span class="accented">through Terrors they befool themselves</span>. "Terrors" is a synonym for the gods of the heathen, which inspired a feeling of awe rather than affection, unlike Jehovah as he revealed himself through the authors of the psalms and prophecies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:33-46 It is Israel's comfort in distress, that, though they are weak, their Redeemer is strong. This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</body></html>
