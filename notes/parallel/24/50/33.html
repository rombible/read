The English tense is misleading. The prophet, having described the doom that lies in the future, now returns to the present, and finds in the actual state of Israel that which made the destruction of Babylon a necessary condition of its liberation. All appeals to the mercy of their conquerors, Assyrian or Chaldaean, had been made in vain.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - At the end of ver. 32 a pause occurs in the discourse. Then the prophet takes up the theme again with renewed emphasis. Were <span class="cmt_word">oppressed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">are oppressed</span>. Because the oppression of Israel and Judah still continues, whereas Israel has by this time been amply punished ("received double," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>) for her transgressions, Jehovah will himself interpose. He is, in fact, Israel's <span class="accented">Goel</span> ("Redeemer"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> charged, like the next of kin, with the duty of recovering thy rights and avenging thy wrongs (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-14.htm">Isaiah 41:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>).

This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</body></html>
