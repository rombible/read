There may, possibly, be a special reference to the fields within the walls of the city, upon which the population largely depended, and which were now to be devastated. (Diod. Sic. ii. 9; Pliny, <span class= "ital">Hist. Nat. </span>xi. 111.)<p><span class= "bld">For fear of the oppressing sword.</span>--The versions present the same noticeable variations, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm" title="He made many to fall, yes, one fell on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.">Jeremiah 46:16</a>, the LXX. giving "from the Greek sword," possibly with reference to the belief that Cyrus had subdued the 'olians and Ionians before the conquest of Babylon, and that they were fighting in his army, or to Alexander's capture of the city, and the Vulg. "from the sword of the dove," the latter rendering being supposed to refer to the dove on the Babylonian standard, as the emblem of Semiramis. Here, however, as Babylon is the object of attack, the latter allusion is scarcely applicable, and there is no sufficient reason for altering the English version. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-38.htm" title="He has forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm" title="He made many to fall, yes, one fell on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.">Jeremiah 46:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They shall flee every one to his own land.</span>--The words are significant as showing that the Jews were not the only people for whom the fall of Babylon was the signal of a return from exile. The policy of Nebuchadnezzar, like that of Assyria, had been to people his own territory with the captive populations of other countries, and Israel (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-8.htm" title="Remove out of the middle of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.">Jeremiah 50:8</a>) was to lead the way in the return.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut off the sower,</span> etc. "Babylon" here probably means Babylonia, for it is clear from ver. 12 that the curse belongs to the country as well as the city of Babylon; indeed, "Babylon" in ver. 13 seems to be used in the wider sense. Others think of the open spaces within the walls of Babylon, in which it is said that crops were raised to provision the city in case of a siege (see Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:518); but this is less natural. <span class="cmt_word">They shall turn,</span> etc. The subject is, not the husbandmen, but the strangers in Babylonia; comp. the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>, on which this passage is based. AEsehylus ('Pers.,' 53) speaks of the <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in Babylon. Whether brought by force from their homes, like the Jews, or voluntary residents for the sake of commerce, all should hurry from the doomed city. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:8-20 The desolation that shall be brought upon Babylon is set forth in a variety of expressions. The cause of this destruction is the wrath of the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hath sinned against the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God's judgments. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture. All who return to God and their duty, shall find satisfaction of soul in so doing. Deliverances out of trouble are comforts indeed, when fruits of the forgiveness of sin.</body></html>
