Herodotus (vii. 61-69), in his account of the army of Xerxes, names twenty-two, from the Medes and Persians at the head of the list to the Arabians and Ethiopians at its close.<p><span class= "bld">From thence she shall be taken.</span>--The Hebrew adverb may be taken either of time or place. The latter, as referring to the region from which the assailants come, gives the better sense.<p><span class= "bld">As of a mighty expert man.</span>--The marginal rendering, "destroyer," follows the Vulgate and the Targum, and represents a various reading. There is no sufficient reason for rejecting the Authorised Version, which has the support of the LXX. and the Syriac versions.<p><span class= "bld">None shall return in vain.</span>--Grammatically the words may refer either to the warrior or the arrow. The use of the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-22.htm" title="From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.">2Samuel 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm" title="So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.">Isaiah 55:11</a> is perhaps in favour of the latter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will raise;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I will stir up</span> (or, <span class="accented">awaken</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">An assembly of great nations.</span> So in a parallel prophecy, "the kingdoms of nations gathered together" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>). Callias in Ebers' learned story, 'The Egyptian Princess,' speaks of "an empire so casually heaped together, and consisting of seventy populations of different tongues and customs, as that of Persia." <span class="cmt_word">From thence;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the headquarters of the array of nations. <span class="cmt_word">As of a mighty expert man</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as of an expert warrior</span> (or, <span class="accented">mighty man</span>). The marginal rendering of the Authorized Version represents a various reading of the Hebrew found in three old editions, and presupposed in the Targum and Vulgate, "one making childless," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a destroyer." The received reading, however, is self-evidently right. <span class="cmt_word">None shall return in vain.</span> It seems doubtful whether this refers to the arrow or to the mighty man. The arrow may be said to "return [or, 'turn'] in vain" when it misses its aim or strikes the mark without piercing it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>, where, however, it is the sword which is thus spoken of); the mighty man when he retires from the field defeated. This wider use of the phrase is sanctioned by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:8-20 The desolation that shall be brought upon Babylon is set forth in a variety of expressions. The cause of this destruction is the wrath of the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hath sinned against the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God's judgments. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture. All who return to God and their duty, shall find satisfaction of soul in so doing. Deliverances out of trouble are comforts indeed, when fruits of the forgiveness of sin.</body></html>
