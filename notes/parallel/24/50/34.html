that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.">Numbers 35:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm" title="Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-8.htm" title="Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for you.

It is interesting to note, in connection with the obvious allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-18.htm" title="Pride goes before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.">Proverbs 16:18</a>, that here, with the exception of the name of "the Lord of hosts is his name," we have an actual citation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-11.htm" title="For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with you.">Proverbs 23:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">That he may give rest to the land.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to the earth, </span>in its widest extent, as implying that the whole earth had groaned under the oppression of Babylon. "The land," if we retain that rendering, would be, of course, "the land of Israel." Some versions, however (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>the Vulg.), and some commentators (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Ewald), give the verbs the sense of "set in motion," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"trouble," and so make the parallelism of the two clauses one of resemblance and not of contrast.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he may give rest to the land;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to the earth.</span> Babylon was one of the great world empires; we can hardly dispense with this convenient Germanism. It was the wont of the Chaldeans, as Habakkuk puts it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>), "to walk through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that were not theirs." Observe the striking contrast - "rest" to the world which has been too long deprived of it, and "disquiet" to those who have hitherto spread it far and wide (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2, 3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:33-46 It is Israel's comfort in distress, that, though they are weak, their Redeemer is strong. This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</body></html>
