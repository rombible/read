Here, however, its use is not that of furnishing a rallying point for an army, but that of a means of rapid communication, like the succession of beacon-fires in the opening of the <span class= "ital">Agamemnon </span>of 'schylus (<span class= "ital">Agam., </span>272-307). The tidings of the fall of Babylon are to be proclaimed as quickly as may be throughout the world.<p><span class= "bld">Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces.</span>--Strictly speaking these, as found in the inscriptions, were names of the same deity (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a>). The name of Bel appears in the names of the two great walls of Babylon, Imgur-Bel and Nimetti-Bel (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 125). The latter name, sometimes in the form of Marduk, appears as lord of heaven and earth, and Nebo is subordinate to him. Nebuchadnezzar's devotion to him is indicated by <span class= "ital">the name </span>he gave his son, Evil-merodach (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), and by describing himself in his inscriptions as "worshipper of Marduk" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 113). So we have among Chaldaean names Merodach-baladan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm" title="At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.">2Kings 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a>), Kurdur-Marduk, and others. The inscriptions at Borsippa speak of him as "the great lord, the most ancient of the gods, the lord of the gates of heaven," and so on (Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Herodotus, </span>i. 627-631).<p><span class= "bld">Idols . . . images.</span>--The words had better be inverted.

Babylon (like Moab) <span class="accented">is</span> taken; her idols <span class="accented">are</span> destroyed. In his exuberant joy, he calls on the bystanders to proclaim the good news to the sympathetic nations, and to <span class="cmt_word">set up</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">lift up</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>a standard</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>), to call the attention of those who might not be within hearing of the proclamation. The idols have been convicted of false pretensions; they are <span class="accented">ashamed</span> and <span class="accented">dismayed</span> (so we should render rather than <span class="cmt_word">confounded</span> and <span class="cmt_word">broken in pieces</span>) at the terrible result to their worshippers. <span class="cmt_word">Bel</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Merodach</span> are not different deifies, but merely different names of one of the two principal gods of the later Babylonian empire. Bel, it is true, was originally distinct from Merodach, but ultimately identified with him. Merodach was the tutelary god of Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar seems to have been specially addicted to his worship, though, indeed, he mentions Nebo also with hardly less honour. This is the beginning of an inscription of this king's, preserved at the India House: - "Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, glorious prince, worshipper of Marduk, adorer of the lofty one, glorifier of Nabu, the exalted, the <span class="accented">possessor</span> of intelligence" (Mr. Rodwell's translation, 'Records of the Past,' 5:113). Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar speaks of Marduk as "the god my maker," "the chief of the gods," and of himself as "his (Marduk's) eldest son, the chosen of his heart." Her images. It is a very peculiar word (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>), specially frequent in Ezekiel, and also found in a chapter of Leviticus with which Ezekiel has affinities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>). It evidently involves a sore disparagement of idol worship. The etymological meaning is "things rolled," which may be variously interpreted as "idol blocks" (Gesenius), or "doll images" (Ewald). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:1-7 The king of Babylon was kind to Jeremiah, yet the prophet must foretell the ruin of that kingdom. If our friends are God's enemies, we dare not speak peace to them. The destruction of Babylon is spoken of as done thoroughly. Here is a word for the comfort of the Jews. They shall return to their God first, then to their own land; the promise of their conversion and reformation makes way for the other promises. Their tears flow not from the sorrow of the world, as when they went into captivity, but from godly sorrow. They shall seek after the Lord as their God, and have no more to do with idols. They shall think of returning to their own country. This represents the return of poor souls to God. In true converts there are sincere desires to attain the end, and constant cares to keep in the way. Their present case is lamented as very sad. The sins of professing Christians never will excuse those who rejoice in destroying them.</body></html>
