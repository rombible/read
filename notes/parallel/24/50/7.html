What was to him its extremest humiliation. was that it put a taunt into the mouths of the enemies of her people. They were able to say, "We are acting rightly: we are but instruments in the hands of God." The words that follow can scarcely be thought of as those of the enemies of Israel, but as added by the prophet to emphasise the guilt of his own people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We offend not;</span> rather, <span class="accented">we incur no guilt.</span> As long as Israel lived a life consecrated to Jehovah, "all that devoured him incurred guilt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm">Jeremiah 2:3</a>).

If our friends are God's enemies, we dare not speak peace to them. The destruction of Babylon is spoken of as done thoroughly. Here is a word for the comfort of the Jews. They shall return to their God first, then to their own land; the promise of their conversion and reformation makes way for the other promises. Their tears flow not from the sorrow of the world, as when they went into captivity, but from godly sorrow. They shall seek after the Lord as their God, and have no more to do with idols. They shall think of returning to their own country. This represents the return of poor souls to God. In true converts there are sincere desires to attain the end, and constant cares to keep in the way. Their present case is lamented as very sad. The sins of professing Christians never will excuse those who rejoice in destroying them.</body></html>
