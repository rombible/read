It is as though the prophet watched that northern quarter of the heavens, and saw storm after storm, torrent after torrent, bursting out upon the south. The nations are named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27-28</a>. We are almost irresistibly reminded of the language in which the historians of the fourth and fifth centuries speak of the Gothic and Teutonic tribes that poured down upon the Roman Empire.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of the north.</span> There was a peculiar mystery attaching to the north in the Hebrew mind, as, in fact, the word very for "north" in Hebrew (literally, <span class="accented">the hidden</span>) indicates. The burnt offering was to be sacrificed on the north side of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>), and the four cherubim, in the vision of Ezekiel, are described as coming from the north (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>). The horror with which Babylon was regarded was intensified, apparently, by its northern position (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>), and now the "hidden" north again pours forth its swarms of warriors against Babylon herself. <span class="cmt_word">They shall remove, they shall depart;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they are fled, they are gone</span>; almost the same clause occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>. The prediction is realized as past. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:1-7 The king of Babylon was kind to Jeremiah, yet the prophet must foretell the ruin of that kingdom. If our friends are God's enemies, we dare not speak peace to them. The destruction of Babylon is spoken of as done thoroughly. Here is a word for the comfort of the Jews. They shall return to their God first, then to their own land; the promise of their conversion and reformation makes way for the other promises. Their tears flow not from the sorrow of the world, as when they went into captivity, but from godly sorrow. They shall seek after the Lord as their God, and have no more to do with idols. They shall think of returning to their own country. This represents the return of poor souls to God. In true converts there are sincere desires to attain the end, and constant cares to keep in the way. Their present case is lamented as very sad. The sins of professing Christians never will excuse those who rejoice in destroying them.</body></html>
