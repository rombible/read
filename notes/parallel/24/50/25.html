Here the figure is that of a mighty king going to his arsenal and equipping himself with the weapons which will insure his victory.

The latter phrase, occurs again in the parallel prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>), where it is evidently applied to the army of Medo-Persian invaders. <span class="cmt_word">For this is the work,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:21-32 The forces are mustered and empowered to destroy Babylon.
