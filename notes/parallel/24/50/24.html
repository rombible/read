Cyrus turned aside the waters of the Euphrates into another channel, and entered by the river-bed, so that the city was taken before those who lived in the middle of the city knew that it was attacked (Herod. i. 191). In the latter case the gates were opened to Darius by the treachery of the Babylonian general Zopyrus (Herod. iii. 158). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm" title="In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.">Daniel 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>.)

But the cylinder inscription, translated by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1880, shows that Babylon opened its gates of its own accord, on hearing the defeat and capture of Nabonidus. There is no occasion to look for any further fulfilment of the prophecy than the surprise which must ever come upon the bystander when he sees a mighty empire suddenly pass into the hands of its enemies. The tenses in this verse are not very happily rendered. It would be better to translate, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">laid a snare for thee, and thou wast taken, O Babylon, unawares</span>; <span class="accented">thou wast found, etc., because thou hadst striven against the Lord.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:21-32 The forces are mustered and empowered to destroy Babylon.

Babylon's pride must be her ruin; she has been proud against the Holy One of Israel; who can keep those up whom God will throw down?</body></html>
