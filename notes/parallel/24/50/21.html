The most probable explanation of its use is that the prophet coined it as a descriptive word (= land of two rebellions), and then substituted it, after his manner (as with Sheshach, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-6.htm" title="And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.">Jeremiah 25:6</a>; Magor-missabib, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, The LORD has not called your name Pashur, but Magormissabib.">Jeremiah 20:3</a>), for the name Aram-Naharaim (= land of the two rivers = Mesopotamia), which was, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm" title="Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>, the recognised name of the country between the Tigris and Euphrates. It was, he seems to say, the country, not of rivers, but of rebellions, choosing the dual form, partly for the sake of assonance, partly to express the fact that Babylon having rebelled against Assyria, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Merodach-baladan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a>) and Nabopolassar had done, had also rebelled against Jehovah. Possibly, however, the dual may simply express intensity. Such changes of names were quite after the manner of Old Testament usage. So Beth-aven was substituted for Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm" title="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.">Hosea 10:5</a>), Mephibosheth for Meribbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.">2Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-34.htm" title="And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal; and Meribbaal begat Micah.">1Chronicles 8:34</a>). Micah 1 is full of such paronomasiae.<p><span class= "bld">Against the inhabitants of Pekod.</span>--Here we have a name which is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm" title="The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding on horses.">Ezekiel 23:23</a> and in inscriptions as that of a Babylonian town, as in a list of rebels, and in the form <span class= "ital">Bukudu, </span>as in the Cylinder of Sennacherib (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 26), and is the name of a city, <span class= "ital">Nahar-Pekod, </span>mentioned in the Talmud (Frst, <span class= "ital">Lex. s.v., </span>and Neubauer, <span class= "ital">Geog. du Talm., </span>p. 363). We can scarcely doubt, however, that the prophet chose this name for the sake of its meaning, "visitation." It was necessary to find a word to be at once <span class= "ital">nomen et omen </span>for the guilt of Babylon. There was one ready at hand applicable to its punishment.<p><span class= "bld">Waste and utterly destroy.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">slay and devote to destruction. </span>The latter verb is connected with the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Cherem, </span>which expressed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-26.htm" title="Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-13.htm" title="Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus said the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the middle of you, O Israel: you can not stand before your enemies, until you take away the accursed thing from among you.">Joshua 7:13</a>, the idea of a solemn anathema.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-28.</span> - The punishment of Babylon, corresponding to her crimes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land of Merathaim;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of double rebellion. Probably enough an actual geographical name may lie at the root of this singular expression; but we are not able at present to say what it was. The prophet has, at any rate, modified it in such a way as to convey a definite meaning, symbolic of the character of Babylon (comp. on ver. 31). What was this meaning? According to Gesenius, there is an allusion to the two great blows inflicted on Israel and Judah by Assyria and Babylon respectively; but as these two powers were but the instruments of a higher Hand, this explanation would seem to be inconsistent with the prophetic teaching. Dahler, De Wette, and Keil take the two rebellions to be the spiritual ones of idolatry and pride; and there is no obvious objection to this. But the dual may be simply intended to express intensity; comp. ch. 17:18, "Destroy them with double destruction" (see note). <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Pekod</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. of punishment. But here too a geographical name very probably lies underneath. The Taylor cylinder inscription of Sennacherib mentions a Pukudu ( = Pekod), together with Havrann (Hauran) and Nabatu (Nabathaeans); but this was the name of a tribe. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a> we read, "The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa," etc.; and in 'Records of the Past,' 11:92, we find a town Pikudu mentioned, lying to the south of Babylon, which may, perhaps, have given its name to a district, and to this district the prophet not improbably alludes. M. Halevy conjectures that the event which corresponds to the prophecy is the decisive battle which virtually terminated the Babylonian empire. According to the newly discovered Cyrus inscription, this battle was fought near a place called Rutu, which appears to have been situated in the neighbourhood of Pukudu ('Records,' <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). About the symbolic meaning there can be no doubt: Pekod is a worthy pendant to Merathaim. Sin and punishment are so closely connected in the prophetic mind that one word sometimes covers both notions. It is doubtful, for instance, whether the better rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a> is "draw sin as with a cart rope" or "draw punishment." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:21-32 The forces are mustered and empowered to destroy Babylon. Let them do what God demands, and they shall bring to pass what he threatens. The pride of men's hearts sets God against them, and ripens them apace for ruin. Babylon's pride must be her ruin; she has been proud against the Holy One of Israel; who can keep those up whom God will throw down?</body></html>
