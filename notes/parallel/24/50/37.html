Here it is used of the auxiliaries of Babylon, which were probably as numerous, and to a large extent the same, as those of Persia. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-9.htm" title="For, see, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.">Jeremiah 50:9</a>.) The "treasures" point to the wealth in which Babylon exulted, and which gave to her the epithet of the "Golden City" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm" title="That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!">Isaiah 14:4</a>). Even under the Persian monarchy 'schylus uses "gold-abounding" as a normal epithet for it.

Even if in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a> the Hebrew '<span class="accented">erebh</span> is an ethnographical term reminding us of the Assyrian <span class="accented">Urbi</span> used of Bedouin tribes, it is clear that no such explanation will suit here (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:33-46 It is Israel's comfort in distress, that, though they are weak, their Redeemer is strong. This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</body></html>
