we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.">Isaiah 53:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm" title="And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.">Ezekiel 34:5</a>. The "shepherds" are, as ever, the kings and civil rulers of the people. In the "mountains" and "hills" we see partly the natural surroundings of the imagery, partly a special reference to the idolatrous worship of the high places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-2.htm" title="Lift up your eyes to the high places, and see where you have not been lien with. In the ways have you sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your prostitutions and with your wickedness.">Jeremiah 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm" title="The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.">Jeremiah 3:6</a>). The Hebrew text as it stands gives, <span class= "ital">they have led them on seducing mountains, i.e., </span>the "high places" which had so strange a fascination for them. The Authorised version follows the marginal reading of the Hebrew. The "forgotten resting place," or, perhaps, the <span class= "ital">fold, </span>is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-7.htm" title="All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.">Jeremiah 50:7</a>, the "habitation of justice," the <span class= "ital">true pasturage, </span>the righteousness which is found in fellowship with Jehovah Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lost sheep.</span> Not merely with reference to the scattering of the Captivity (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>, where the Authorized Version has "ready to perish"), but to the transgressions of the Law of God, of which the Jews had been constantly guilty (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their shepherds... mountains.</span> This is the marginal correction in the Hebrew Bible; the text has, "Their shepherds have caused them to go astray upon the seducing mountains" - a strange expression, which is, however, defended by Naegelsbach on the ground of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Their resting place;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their couching place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their pasture, Jehovah, at once their Pasture (ver. 7) and their true Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:1-7 The king of Babylon was kind to Jeremiah, yet the prophet must foretell the ruin of that kingdom. If our friends are God's enemies, we dare not speak peace to them. The destruction of Babylon is spoken of as done thoroughly. Here is a word for the comfort of the Jews. They shall return to their God first, then to their own land; the promise of their conversion and reformation makes way for the other promises. Their tears flow not from the sorrow of the world, as when they went into captivity, but from godly sorrow. They shall seek after the Lord as their God, and have no more to do with idols. They shall think of returning to their own country. This represents the return of poor souls to God. In true converts there are sincere desires to attain the end, and constant cares to keep in the way. Their present case is lamented as very sad. The sins of professing Christians never will excuse those who rejoice in destroying them.</body></html>
