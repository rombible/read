In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm" title="And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?">Nehemiah 4:2</a>, however, it is used of heaps of rubbish. The stored-up provisions of the captured city are to be piled up in its open places, as men pile the sheaves of corn after harvest, and burnt (for "destroy" read <span class= "ital">devote to destruction</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as had been done, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the capture of Jericho and other cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-24.htm" title="And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.">Joshua 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/11-12.htm" title="And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.">Joshua 11:12-13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Let nothing of her be left.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">let there be no remnant, </span>as in marked contrast with the "remnant" of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-20.htm" title="In those days, and in that time, said the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.">Jeremiah 50:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come against her;</span> rather, Come to her. Dr. Payne Smith infers that Babylon has already fallen, and that the persons addressed are not warriors only, but plunderers of every kind. This is almost too subtle. The prepositions "to" and "against' (literally, upon) are so frequently interchanged (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the utmost border;</span> rather, <span class="accented">all</span> to<span class="accented">gether</span>; it is an idiom expressing universality. Those who are spoken of are regarded as a totality, "from the utmost end" of which its members come. <span class="cmt_word">Cast her up as heaps;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Cast it up as sheaves</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ransack the repositories of Babylon's wealth, and heap it up like corn; last of all, <span class="cmt_word">destroy her</span> (rather, <span class="accented">it</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>utterly</span>. The verb is a very emphatic one. Its primary meaning is "to cut off, or shut off." Hence <span class="accented">kherem</span>, a devoted thing, is applied in the Law to that which is "tabooed," as it were, cut off from any but sacred uses. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a> it is used of a field wholly appropriated to the sanctuary, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a> to living beings doomed to destruction.
