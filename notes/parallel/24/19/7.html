Such a play upon the sound and sense of words is quite in accordance with the genius of Hebrew prophecy, but it is obviously in most cases impossible to reproduce it in another language. The primary meaning is "to pour out, to spill," and so "to waste, <span class= "ital">or </span>bring to nought." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm" title="And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the middle thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.">Isaiah 19:3</a>.) Some interpreters have supposed that the words were accompanied by corresponding acts, and that the earthen bottle, which the prophet had brought filled with water, was now emptied in the sight of the people, with a symbolism like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm" title="And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.">1Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm" title="For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.">2Samuel 14:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will make void</span>; literally, I <span class="accented">will pour out</span>, alluding to the etymology of the word rendered "bottle" in ver. 1. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-9 The prophet must give notice of ruin coming upon Judah and Jerusalem. Both rulers and ruled must attend to it. That place which holiness made the joy of the whole earth, sin made the reproach and shame of the whole earth. There is no fleeing from God's justice, but by fleeing to his mercy.</body></html>
