"In the days of old," patriarchal and unmilitary, the fertile valley of the Nile offered a peaceful and a happy home to its teeming inhabitants; those times shall yet come again. To understand this, we must assume that during its period of depression Egypt has been but sparsely peopled, owing to the large numbers of its inhabitants carried away captive. Another explanation, "afterwards Egypt shall stay at home [i.e, 'be quiet']," though equally justifiable item the point of view of the lexicon (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-7.htm">Psalm 55:7</a>), seems less natural. Possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13-16</a> is a development of our passage; it contains a promise of future remission of punishment, though a promise qualified in such a way as to be akin to a threat. The words, "And it shall no more be the confidence of the house of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-16.htm">Ezekiel 29:16</a>), seem like a comment on Jeremiah's threat to "Pharaoh, and them that trust in him," in the preceding verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:13-28 Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on. Egypt is now like a very fair heifer, not accustomed to the yoke of subjection; but destruction comes out of the north: the Chaldeans shall come. Comfort and peace are spoken to the Israel of God, designed to encourage them when the judgments of God were abroad among the nations. He will be with them, and only correct them in measure; and will not punish them with everlasting destruction from his presence.</body></html>
