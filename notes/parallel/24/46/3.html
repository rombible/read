Light-armed skirmishers were known in Italian as "brigands" (<span class= "ital">briganti--</span>literally, "quarrellers"); the light coat of mail worn by them was accordingly known as a "brigandine." When the Italian word became synonymous with robbers by land or sea, the ship used by them was called a <span class= "ital">brigantino, </span>and from this is derived our English "brig" (W. A. Wright: <span class= "ital">Bible Word Book</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The word "brigandine" is accordingly used by writers of the sixteenth century in both senses: by Spenser, for a ship--<p>"Like as a warlike brigandine applied<p>To fight;"<p>and by Milton--<p>"Then put on all thy gorgeous arms, thy helmet<p>And brigandine or brass"<p>(<span class= "ital">Sams.

The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines. Power and prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changing world.</body></html>
