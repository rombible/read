The prophet goes back, as an English poet might have done after the destruction of the Spanish Armada, to the time when all the strength of Egypt had been poured forth in the exultation of anticipated victory, as the great river of Egypt poured its waters. The word for "rivers," though more general, has a like allusive reference, being used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.">Exodus 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-5.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-14.htm" title="Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 32:14</a> for the arms or canals of the Nile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this,</span> etc.? "Once more surprise at the [same] phenomenon recurs, and in a stronger form; a monstrous, devastating river appears to roll itself wildly along, overwhelming all countries: who is it?

The naturalness of the figure in this context needs no exhibiting. It reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7, 8</a>, where the Assyrian army is compared to the Euphrates. <span class="cmt_word">Are moved as the rivers;</span> rather, <span class="accented">toss themselves as the rivers.</span> By the "rivers" the prophet means the branches of the Nile, which are described by the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-8.htm">Isaiah 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-12 The whole word of God is against those who obey not the gospel of Christ; but it is for those, even of the Gentiles, who turn to Him. The prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselves with all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain. The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines. Power and prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changing world.</body></html>
