The "chariots and horses" had long been proverbial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/10-28.htm" title="And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.">1Kings 10:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-16.htm" title="And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.">2Chronicles 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-19.htm" title="For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the middle of the sea.">Exodus 15:19</a>). The Cushites were the Ethiopians of the Upper Valley of the Nile, sometimes, as under Zerah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9</a>) and Tirhakah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2Kings 19:9</a>), asserting their independence, but at this time subject to Necho. The name Phut meets us, with Cush and Mizraim, in the list of the sons of Ham in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a>; and presumably, therefore, belongs to an African people. Wherever it is mentioned by the prophets it is as an ally or tributary of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm" title="Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.">Nahum 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm" title="They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm" title="Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm" title="Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). The LXX. version renders it by Libyan, and is followed by the Vulgate and the English. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm" title="Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.">Nahum 3:9</a>, however, Phut is distinguished from the Libyans (= Lubim); and the LXX. has but one word for both. The word PET is found on Egyptian inscriptions, both as meaning a "bow"and as the name of a people, and this may correspond to the <span class= "ital">Put </span>of the Hebrew text. The Lydians, or <span class= "ital">Ludim, </span>are named in the list of Hamite nations as descended from Mizraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm" title="And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,">Genesis 10:13</a>); the name is joined with Phut in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm" title="They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.">Ezekiel 27:10</a>, with Cush and Phut in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/30-4.htm" title="And the sword shall come on Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.">Ezekiel 30:4-5</a>. This would seem to point to an African rather than an Asiatic people like the Lydians. On the other hand, we learn from Herodotus (ii. 153) that, some thirty or forty years before the time of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Psammetichus I. had settled a large colony of Ionian and Carian emigrants on both banks of the Nile, between Bubastis and the Pelusiac mouth of that river, and that Amasis afterwards formed them into a bodyguard at Memphis. It is obvious that the fame of the monarchy which had its capital at Sardis might easily lead to these Greeks being classed as Lydians, and that thus the name (without entering into its earlier ethnological significance) would acquire a new prominence at the time when the prophets wrote in connexion with Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - A call to the army, particularizing its two grand divisions, viz. the warriors in chariots, and the light and heavy armed infantry. M. Piorret, of the Egyptian Museum at the Louvre, writes thus: "The army was composed <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of infantry equipped with a cuirass, a buckler, a pike or an axe, and a sword; they manoeuvred to the sound of the drum and the trumpet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of light troops (archers, slingers, and other soldiers carrying the axe or the tomahawk); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> warriors in chariots. Cavalry, properly so called, was not employed ... The Egyptians also enlisted auxiliaries, such as Mashawash, a tribe of Libyans, who, after the defeat of a confederation of northern peoples hostile to Menephtah, into which they had entered, refused to leave Egypt, and entered the Egyptian army; the Kahakas, another Libyan tribe; the Shardanas (Sardinians); the Madjaiu, who, after having been in war with the Egyptians under the twelfth dynasty, enrolled themselves under the standard of their conquerors, and constituted a sort of gendarmerie," etc. ('Dictionnaire d'Archdologie Egyptienne,' pp. 64, 65). Among the mercenaries mentioned by Jeremiah, the Ludim deserve special mention. They are generally supposed to be a North African people (and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). Professor Sayce, however, thinks they may be the Lydian soldiers by whose help Psammetichus made Egypt independent of Assyria, and his successors maintained their power (Cheyne's 'Prophecies of Isaiah,' 2:287). <span class="cmt_word">Come up, ye horses;</span> rather, <span class="accented">bound</span> (or, prance), <span class="accented">ye horses.</span> The verb is literally go up, and seems to be used in the same sense, only in the Hiphil or causative conjugation, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-3.htm">Nahum 3:3</a> (which should begin, "Horsemen making (their horses) to rear"). Ewald and others render, "Mount the horses," the phrase being substantially the same as in ver. 4 (see above). But the parallelism here is opposed to this; and the prophet has evidently been a reader of the prophecy of Nahum, as the very next clause shows. <span class="cmt_word">Rage, ye chariots;</span> rather, <span class="accented">rush madly, ye chariots</span> (alluding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-5.htm">Nahum 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Ethioplans;</span> Hebrew, Cush; often mentioned in connection with Egypt. The whole Nile valley, as far as Abyssinia, had been reduced to an Egyptian province. At last Cush had its turn of revenge, and an Ethiopian dynasty reigned in the palaces of Thebes (<span class="accented">s.c.</span> 725-665). <span class="cmt_word">The Libyans;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Put</span> (which occurs in combination with Lud, as here with Ludim, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). This appears to be the Egyptian Put (nasalized into Punt), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Somali country on the east coast of Africa, opposite to Arabia (Brugsch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-12 The whole word of God is against those who obey not the gospel of Christ; but it is for those, even of the Gentiles, who turn to Him. The prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselves with all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain. The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines. Power and prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changing world.</body></html>
