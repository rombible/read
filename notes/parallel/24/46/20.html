The nation is like its god. The figure is continued in the words that follow. There comes from the north (from the land of the Chaldees, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:">Jeremiah 1:1</a>), not "destruction," but a <span class= "ital">gadfly </span>that shall sting the heifer into the madness of agony. So, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:18</a>, the "fly" of Egypt and the "bee" of Assyria are invited to work evil on Judah. The words find a striking parallel in the Greek legend of Io (probably to be identified with the Egyptian Isis) transformed into a heifer, and her gadfly tormentor, this also connected with the Apis or Mnevis deities of Egypt ('schyl. <span class= "ital">Prom. </span>v. 569). The word for "destruction" is not found elsewhere, but the etymology suggests the idea of "pinching" or "stinging," and the meaning "gadfly" is accepted by many recent scholars.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-26.</span> - A figurative description of the dark future of Egypt. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Like <span class="cmt_word">a very fair heifer.</span> (The insertion of "like" weakens the passage.) The well nourished heifer reminds of the prosperity of the fruitful Nile valley. But destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north; rather, <span class="accented">a gadfly from the north hath come upon her</span> (not, "hath come, hath come," as the received text has - a very slight change in one letter is required, supported by the versions). The figure is precisely analogous to that of the "bee in the land of Assyria" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). St. Chrysostom renders "a gadfly" (see Field, 'Origen's Hexapla,' 2:708); and so virtually Aquila and Symmachus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:13-28 Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on. Egypt is now like a very fair heifer, not accustomed to the yoke of subjection; but destruction comes out of the north: the Chaldeans shall come. Comfort and peace are spoken to the Israel of God, designed to encourage them when the judgments of God were abroad among the nations. He will be with them, and only correct them in measure; and will not punish them with everlasting destruction from his presence.</body></html>
