The meaning of the English version is that the exiles returning to their own land would say that Pharaoh with all his haughty boasts was but an empty noise, that he had passed the limit of God's long-suffering, and that the day of retribution had come. A slight change in the Hebrew words, however, gives, <span class= "ital">They have called the name of Pharaoh king of Egypt, A Noise; he hath passed </span>(<span class= "ital">or lost</span>)<span class= "ital"> the appointed season</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the time allowed by the long-suffering of God. This is supported by some of the ancient versions, and may be accepted as the best rendering. The LXX. and Vulg. agree in taking the opening words as an imperative, "Call ye the name of Pharaoh<span class= "bld"> . . . </span>;" but the former, as if despairing of the meaning, simply reproduces the Hebrew words that follow in Greek letters, while the latter translates, <span class= "ital">Tumultum adduxit tempus </span>("Time, the appointed time, has brought the noise"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of war and destruction), as if it were, like <span class= "ital">Magor-missabib, </span>a new <span class= "ital">nomen et omen </span>given to the Egyptian king. Luther, giving another meaning to the words translated "appointed time," renders "Pharaoh king of Egypt lies prostrate, he has left his tent." Ewald, following the line of the Vulgate, renders the name by which Pharaoh is spoken of as "tumult, which a sign or 'moment' disperses," the "tumult" being his boastful clamour, the "sign" the token of Jehovah's will. Hitzig agrees more closely with the English version in the latter clause, and it may be accepted as having on the whole most in its favour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They did cry there,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">they cry there</span>, viz. the following words. But why should attention be called to the place where the cry is made? and why should the mercenaries (the subject of the preceding verb, and therefore presumably of this verb) have their exclamation recorded? Alter the vowel points (which merely represent an early but not infallible exegetical tradition), and all becomes clear. We then get a renewal of the summons in ver. 14 to make a proclamation respecting the war. The persons addressed are, not foreigners, but the children of the soil, and the summons runs thus: "Call ye the name of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, Desolation." No longer "Pharaoh," honoured by titles indicating that he, like Apis, is a Divine incarnation (<span class="accented">neb</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lord, and <span class="accented">nuter, i.e.</span> god), but <span class="accented">Shaon</span>, the Hebrew for Desolation, is the fittest name for the fallen monarch. The custom of changing names with a symbolic meaning is no strange one to readers of the prophecies. We have met with it in this very book (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>); and Isaiah contains a parallel as exact as could be desired, in the famous passage in which the prophetic name (itself symbolic) of Egypt (<span class="cmt_word">Rahab</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> boisterousness, arrogance) is changed into "Rahabhem-shebheth" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Rahab! they are utter indolence"). In behalf of this view we may claim the authority of a tradition still older than that preserved in the vowel points, for the Septuagint (followed substantially by the Peshito and the Vulgate) has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He hath passed the time appointed.</span> A difficult clause, and variously interpreted. One thing is clear, that "passed" cannot be correct, as the verb is in the Hifil or causative conjugation. We must, at any rate, render, "He hath let the time appointed pass by." This is, in fact, the simplest and most natural explanation. There was a time within which repentance might have averted the judgment of God; but this "accepted time" has been foolishly let slip. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:13-28 Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on. Egypt is now like a very fair heifer, not accustomed to the yoke of subjection; but destruction comes out of the north: the Chaldeans shall come. Comfort and peace are spoken to the Israel of God, designed to encourage them when the judgments of God were abroad among the nations. He will be with them, and only correct them in measure; and will not punish them with everlasting destruction from his presence.</body></html>
