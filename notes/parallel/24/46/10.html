In doing so he falls back upon the language of earlier prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm" title="For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.">Isaiah 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7</a>), in part also upon that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm" title="I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy.">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>. There is to be a "great sacrifice," and the army of Egypt is the destined victim; and the banks of the Euphrates (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Carchemish) are to be as the altar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The contrast.</span> <span class="accented">And yet that day is</span> (<span class="accented">the day</span>) <span class="accented">of the Lord, Jehovah Sabdoth</span> (the rendering of the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">For this is the day,</span> etc., is clearly a mistake). The "day of Jehovah" is an expression so familiar to us that we are in danger of losing a part of its sublime meaning. It is, in brief, "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient .... This great crisis is called a day, in antithesis to the ages of the Divine long suffering: it is <span class="accented">Jehovah's</span> day, because, without a special Divine interposition, there would be no issue out of the perplexities and miseries of human life." We may say, with equal truth, that there are many "days of the Lord," and that there is only one. Every great revolution is a fresh stage in the great judgment day; "<span class="accented">die Weltgesehichte ist das Weltgericht"</span> (Schiller). The <span class="accented">loci classici</span> for the expression in the prophets are <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a> (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, the phraseology closely resembles that of our passage - "for there is a day unto Jehovah Sabaoth;" Jehovah, that is, hath it in readiness in the supersensible world, where there is no time, and where all God's purposes have an ideal, but no less real existence. We might, in fact, render our passage, "but that day (is the day that belongeth) unto the Lord," etc.). The Lord here, as generally elsewhere, is that expressive form which intimates the universal lordship of the God who has revealed himself to Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The sword.</span> A comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> suggests that it is "the sword of the Lord" which is meant - a symbolic phrase for the Divine vengeance, which meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>. If Jehovah can be spoken of as having an Arm, a Hand, and a Bow, why not also as having a sword? Both expressions represent the self-revealing side of the Divine nature, and are not merely poetical ornaments, but correspond to awful objective realities. Divine vengeance exists, and must exercise itself on all who oppose the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Hath a sacrifice.</span> The same figurative expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, and, developed at considerable length, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-20</a>, where the slaughtered foes are described as fatted beasts, rams, lambs, he-goats, bullocks - animals employed in the Jewish sacrifices. This, then, is the purpose for which this immense host "rolls up from Africa" - it is that it may fall by the Euphrates, at once as a proof of God's justice, and as a warning to transgressors. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-12 The whole word of God is against those who obey not the gospel of Christ; but it is for those, even of the Gentiles, who turn to Him. The prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselves with all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain. The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines. Power and prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changing world.</body></html>
