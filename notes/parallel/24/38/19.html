It was not enough to know that his life would be safe. Would he also be saved from the insults of his own subjects, who had already deserted to the enemy? These were, in the nature of the case, friends and followers of the prophet, and had acted on his advice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>). The king, who had shrunk from Jeremiah's taunts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-19.htm" title="Where are now your prophets which prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?">Jeremiah 37:19</a>), could not, for very shame, expose himself to the derision of others. Perhaps even he feared more than mere derision--outrage, death, mutilation, such as Saul feared at the hands of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1Samuel 31:4</a>).<p>(20?22) <span class= "bld">Obey, I beseech thee. . . .</span>--The king's misgiving is met in part by an earnest entreaty to obey the voice of the Lord, in part by the assurance that thus it "shall be well with him" (literally, <span class= "ital">there shall be peace to thee</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> in part also by bringing before him the mockery which is certain to await him if he persists in his defiance. The women of the harem, the surviving wives and concubines of former kings, as well as his own, should become the spoil of the Chaldaean princes, and should take up their taunting proverbs against him. "Thy friends" (literally, <span class= "ital">the men of thy peace, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm" title="For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.">Jeremiah 20:10</a>; the men who promised peace and safety), "they set thee on, and having dragged thee into the mire of shame, have left thee there." The imagery of the taunt seems drawn from the prophet's recent experience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm" title="Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). The king was plunging into a worse "slough of despond" than that into which Jeremiah had sunk in the dungeon of Malchiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:14-28 Jeremiah was not forward to repeat the warnings, which seemed only to endanger his own life, and to add to the king's guilt, but asked whether he feared to do the will of God. The less men fear God, the more they fear men; often they dare not act according to their own judgments and consciences.</body></html>
