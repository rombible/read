The same phrase is so translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-26.htm" title="And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;">1Kings 22:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-7.htm" title="And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.">2Chronicles 28:7</a>, and would seem to have been an official or court title, applied to one of the royal house, as distinguished from. others. (See Note on Jerahmeel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-26.htm" title="But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.">Jeremiah 36:26</a>.) We have no data for judging whether this Malchiah is identical with the lather of Pashur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm" title="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 38:1</a>; but it is not unlikely. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/lamentations/3-53.htm" title="They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone on me.">Lamentations 3:53-55</a> we have probably a reminiscence of these days of horrible suffering. The cistern had been partly dried up (possibly through the supply of water having been cut off during the protracted siege), but there remained a thick deposit, three or four feet deep, of black foetid mud,, and there, it is obvious from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-9.htm" title="My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.">Jeremiah 38:9</a> of this chapter, his enemies meant to leave him to die of hunger. They probably shrank from the odium of a public execution, or thought, with the strange superstition of the Eastern mind, that in this way they could escape the guilt of shedding the prophet's blood. The death by starva-tion might easily be represented, even to themselves, as a death by disease.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dungeon;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">the cistern.</span> "Every house in Jerusalem was supplied with a subterranean cistern, so well constructed that we never read of the city suffering in a siege from want of water" (Dr. Payne Smith). A grotto bearing the name of Jeremiah has been shown at Jerusalem since the fifteenth century. Under its floor are vast cisterns, the deepest of which professes to be the prison into which the prophet was thrown. The objection is that the sacred narrative proves that the prison was in the city, whereas "the present grotto was not included within the walls until the time of Herod Agrippa" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1881, p. 555). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Hammelech;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a royal prince</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-26.htm">Jeremiah 36:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-13 Jeremiah went on in his plain preaching. The princes went on in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to their master?</body></html>
