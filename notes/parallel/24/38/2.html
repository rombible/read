It is obvious that to all who did not recognise the divine mission of the prophet, words like those which he had then spoken would seem to come from the lips of a traitor. Desertion to the enemy was represented as the only way of safety, and this was the counsel given to those who were defending the city of their fathers against an alien invader. What made it appear worse was that the prophet himself had been caught in an act which, though he denied the charge, might not unnaturally seem like an act of treacherous desertion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that remaineth,</span> etc. Jeremiah repeats what he had said to Zedekiah's embassy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9, 10</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-13 Jeremiah went on in his plain preaching. The princes went on in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to their master?</body></html>
