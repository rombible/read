Probably, the last clause should be read with a different punctuation of the Hebrew, "This city shall be burnt with fire." As the text now stands, the marginal rendering, <span class= "ital">Thou shalt burn, </span>gives the true force of the word. The king himself would have that destruction to answer for. It would be his own act and deed.<p>(24?26) <span class= "bld">Let no man know . . .</span>--The weak king vacillated to the last moment. He feared the prophet, he feared the princes yet more. To hush up all that had passed in the interview, to urge the prophet to baffle the eager suspicions of the princes by a prevaricating statement, as if it had been he who had sought the meeting, and had petitioned the king, as before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm" title="Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray you, be accepted before you; that you cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.">Jeremiah 37:20</a>), to protect him from the cruelties which he had suffered in the house of Jonathan: this was the only course he could bring himself to follow. The plan so far succeeded that the prophet returned and gave the evasive answer which the king suggested. The nature of the interview was concealed, and events took their course; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison till the city was taken. The king's suggestion as to the house of Jonathan implies either that he believed that the princes would urge that Jeremiah should be sent there after his rescue from the dungeon of Malchiah, or else a wish to slur over that transaction altogether.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and they</span>, etc. The women spoken of are different from those in ver. 22. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt cause this city to be burned.</span> The literal rendering (see margin) is, <span class="accented">Thou shalt burn this city</span>; but the Septuagint, Peshito, and Targum have "As for this city it shall be burned," which suits the parallelism better. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:14-28 Jeremiah was not forward to repeat the warnings, which seemed only to endanger his own life, and to add to the king's guilt, but asked whether he feared to do the will of God. The less men fear God, the more they fear men; often they dare not act according to their own judgments and consciences.</body></html>
