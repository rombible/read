His father Shaphan was energetic in the work of re-building the Temple under Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2Kings 22:3</a>), in conjunction with the high priest Hilkiah, and had taken an active part in publishing the contents of the newly-discovered book of the Law of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>). As a scribe, he must have taken part in the king's edicts for the restoration of the true worship, and probably also in ordering copies of the new-found treasure--the whole Law, or, more probably, the book of Deuteronomy--to be made by the scribes who worked under him. We have seen one of his sons, Ahikam, protecting the prophet Jeremiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a>. Here Gemariah places his chamber in the Temple court at the service of the prophet's delegate. The "new gate" may well have been a prominent part of the wor!r effected by Shaphan and Hilkiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/22-5.htm" title="And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,">2Kings 22:5-6</a>), and this may have led to a chamber over it being assigned to his son. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm" title="And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:">Jeremiah 35:4</a>.) The people addressed may have been either in the outer court of the Temple, or gathered outside the gate. A chamber over the gateway would naturally have an opening on either side. The general use of the word for "entry" is in favour of the latter hypothesis.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chamber</span> (see on Jeremiah 35:4) <span class="cmt_word">of Genesisariah...the scribe.</span> Genesisariah was favourably disposed to Jeremiah (ver. 25); he was probably the brother of Jeremiah's friend, Ahikam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>). He was one of the royal secretaries, and reckoned among the "princes" (see ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">In the higher court.</span> "Higher" equivalent to "inner." <span class="cmt_word">The new gate</span> (see on Jeremiah 20:2). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:9-19 Shows of piety and devotion may be found even among those, who, though they keep up forms of godliness, are strangers and enemies to the power of it. The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.</body></html>
