It was in November or December, and, as glass windows were unknown, a charcoal fire, placed after the Eastern fashion in a brazier, or earthen pot, in the middle of the room, was a necessity. So we find a fire in the court of the high priest's palace in the raw early morning of a Passover in March or April (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-18.htm" title="And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.">John 18:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the winter house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that part of the royal palace (<span class="accented">beth</span>, house, may also be rendered <span class="accented">apartment</span>) which was arranged for a winter habitation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). According to Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 309), the more airy part of a house is called "summerhouse," and the more sheltered room "winter house." The ninth month, in which the events now being related took place, corresponded approximately to our December. It was, therefore, the cold and rainy season; December is a stormy month in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">A fire on the hearth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the chafing dish</span> (or, <span class="accented">brazier</span>).
