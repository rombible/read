The princes were anxious to ascertain how far each of the parties concerned was responsible. Had Baruch exercised any discretion in writing so that the words were his, though the substance was Jeremiah's? or had he, on his own responsibility, and without the prophet's will, published what had been written privately? or had every syllable as it was read come from the prophet's lips? The scribe's answer showed that the last hypothesis answered to the facts of the case. On hearing this they, obviously with a friendly regard, advise him and the prophet to hide themselves till they should see what effect the report would have on the king's mind. It would appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-19.htm" title="Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you be.">Jeremiah 36:19</a> that Jeremiah, though "shut up" and unable to go into the house of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-5.htm" title="And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:">Jeremiah 36:5</a>), was not actually so imprisoned as to hinder him from concealing himself. Either, therefore, we must assume that he was in a "<span class= "ital">libera custodia,</span>" that gave him facilities for an escape, which the princes connived at, or that by "shut up" he meant only hindered by some cause or other. The latter seems the more probable hypothesis. In the concealment of the prophet we find a parallel to that of Elijah and the other prophets under Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm" title="Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.">1Kings 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm" title="For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)">1Kings 18:4</a>), of Polycarp (<span class= "ital">Mart.

Baruch's answer is good for both. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:9-19 Shows of piety and devotion may be found even among those, who, though they keep up forms of godliness, are strangers and enemies to the power of it. The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.</body></html>
