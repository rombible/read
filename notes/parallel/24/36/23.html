The act, in its childish impatience, betrayed the anger of the king. He could not bear to hear of the seventy years of exile which were in store for his people, and which, if we assume the roll to have included the substance of Jeremiah 25, would have come into one of the earlier columns. The word for "pen-knife" is used generally for any sharp instrument of iron--for a razor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-1.htm" title="And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.">Ezekiel 5:1</a>), and for a sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>). Here it is the knife which was used to shape the reed, or <span class= "ital">calamus, </span>used in writing. It should, perhaps, be noted that the Hebrew, like the English, leaves it uncertain whether the king himself cut and burnt the roll, or Jehudi with his approval. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a> is in favour of the former view. We are reminded, as we read the words, of like orders given by Antiochus Epiphanes for the destruction of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-56.htm" title="And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which they found, they burnt them with fire.">1 Maccabees 1:56</a>), by Diocletian for that of the sacred books of the Christians, perhaps also of those of the Court of Rome for the destruction of the writings of Wyclif and Luther.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three or four leaves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">columns</span> or <span class="accented">compartments</span>. "Leaves" would imply that it was a book out of which Jehudi read, Whereas it was a roll (<span class="accented">m'gillah</span> never has any other meaning). But "books" were not yet known, nor would a knife have been necessary to separate the pages. <span class="cmt_word">He cut it.</span> The subject may be either the king or Jehudi (at the bidding of the king). The term implies that the action of cutting was repeated several times; but we are not to suppose that each successive portion was cut off as it was read. The indignation of the hearer translated itself into the repeated mutilation of the roll, until all the roll was (east into the fire and) consumed. <span class="cmt_word">With the penknife</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with the scribe's knife. <span class="cmt_word"></span>On the hearth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the chafing dish</span> (or, <span class="accented">brazier</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:20-32 Those who despise the word of God, will soon show, as this king did, that they hate it; and, like him, they would wish it destroyed. See what enmity there is against God in the carnal mind, and wonder at his patience. The princes showed some concern, till they saw how light the king made of it. Beware of making light of God's word!</body></html>
