The term would not imply more than that he belonged to the "royal house." Jehoiakim was only twenty-five when he came to the throne, and could not have had a son old enough to execute the orders given to Jerahmeel. Of Seraiah nothing more is known. He is clearly not identical with the "quiet prince," the son of Neriah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm" title="The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.">Jeremiah 51:59</a>. The name of Shelemiah appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.">Jeremiah 37:3</a>, as the father of Jehucal, who is first sent by Zedekiah to consult the prophet, and who afterwards arrested him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm" title="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 38:1</a>). It is probable in the nature of the case that they belonged to the party of the prophet's enemies. The counsel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-19.htm" title="Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you be.">Jeremiah 36:19</a> had fortunately been given in time, and the attempt to seize the prophet and his scribe was, as we say, providentially frustrated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The son of Hammelech;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a royal prince</span> (we should render similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>). We have seen already that the number of such royal princes was very large (see on Jeremiah 17:9); any one, in fact, who had a king among his ancestors was a "royal prince." <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hid them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> saved them from discovery. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:20-32 Those who despise the word of God, will soon show, as this king did, that they hate it; and, like him, they would wish it destroyed. See what enmity there is against God in the carnal mind, and wonder at his patience. The princes showed some concern, till they saw how light the king made of it. Beware of making light of God's word!</body></html>
