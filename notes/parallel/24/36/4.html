The prophet was, as the next verse shows, in some way hindered, though apparently not by imprisonment, as he and Baruch could hide themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-19.htm" title="Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you be.">Jeremiah 36:19</a>): Baruch therefore had to act not only as the prophet's amanuensis, but as the preacher of his sermon.

The Divine wisdom directed to this as a proper means; if it failed, the house of Judah would be the more without excuse. The Lord declares to sinners the evil he purposes to do against them, that they may hear, and fear, and return from their evil ways; and whenever any one makes this use of God's warnings, in dependence on his promised mercy, he will find the Lord ready to forgive his sins. All others will be left without excuse; and the consideration that great is the anger God has pronounced against us for sin, should quicken both our prayers and our endeavours.</body></html>
