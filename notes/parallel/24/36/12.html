Delaiah (the name signifies "the Lord delivers," and is found as that of a priest in the time of David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-18.htm" title="The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.">1Chronicles 24:18</a>) joins Elnathan and Gemariah in pleading against the king's destruction of the prophetic roll.

On Elnathan, the son of Achbor, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm" title="And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.">Jeremiah 26:22</a>.

The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.</body></html>
