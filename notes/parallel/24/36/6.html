<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.">2Chronicles 20:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm" title="And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.">1Kings 21:10</a>), and it was accordingly a time when the courts of the Temple would be more than usually thronged, and when, it might be hoped, the people gathered in them would be more than usually disposed to listen to warnings and exhortations to repentance. Probably, however, the king had proclaimed the fast by the advice of the priests and false prophets, to rouse the people to the "holy war" of an enthusiastic religious resistance to the Chaldeans, and this may account for the eagerness of Jeremiah to counteract the scheme by the unlooked-for sermon. The addition, "and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah," implies that Baruch was, if opportunity offered, to read the words of the prophecy on other occasions and to other gatherings of the people. The ordinary fast of the Day of Atonement was, it will be remembered, in the seventh month--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>October; this accordingly was in November or December. This agrees, it may be noted, with the charcoal fire which was burning in the king's chamber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-22.htm" title="Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.">Jeremiah 36:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the fasting day</span>. The mention of the fast day suggests that ver. 9 is out of its place, which again confirms the view that the narrative before us has received its present form from an editor. <span class="cmt_word">In the ears of all Judah</span> (see ver. 9). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-8 The writing of the Scriptures was by Divine appointment. The Divine wisdom directed to this as a proper means; if it failed, the house of Judah would be the more without excuse. The Lord declares to sinners the evil he purposes to do against them, that they may hear, and fear, and return from their evil ways; and whenever any one makes this use of God's warnings, in dependence on his promised mercy, he will find the Lord ready to forgive his sins. All others will be left without excuse; and the consideration that great is the anger God has pronounced against us for sin, should quicken both our prayers and our endeavours.</body></html>
