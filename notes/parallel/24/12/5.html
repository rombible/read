What are the petty troubles that fall on him compared with what others suffer, with what might come on himself? The thought is not unlike that with which St. Paul comforts the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>), or what we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-4.htm" title="You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.">Hebrews 12:4</a>. The meaning of the first clause is plain enough. The man who was wearied in a foot-race should not venture (as Elijah, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>had done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.">1Kings 18:46</a>) to measure his speed against that of horses. The latter ("the swelling of Jordan") suggests the thoughts of the turbid stream of the river overflowing its banks in the time of harvest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-15.htm" title="And as they that bore the ark were come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overflows all his banks all the time of harvest,)">Joshua 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-15.htm" title="These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.">1Chronicles 12:15</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm" title="There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.">Zechariah 11:3</a>, however, the same phrase (there translated "the pride of Jordan") is used apparently in connection with the lions and other beasts of prey that haunted the jungle on its banks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?">Jeremiah 50:44</a>), and that may be the thought here. Commentators differ, and there are no <span class= "ital">data </span>for deciding. In any case, there is no need for the interpolated words of the English Version. The sentence should run, "<span class= "ital">In a land of peace thou art secure </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>it is easy to be tranquil when danger is not pressing). <span class= "ital">What wilt thou in the swelling </span>(or, <span class= "ital">amid the pride</span>)<span class= "ital"> of Jordan?</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Jeremiah's impatience corrected. The expressions are evidently proverbial. The opposition to the prophet will reach a still higher pitch; and if he is so soon discouraged, how will he bear his impending trials? <span class="cmt_word">And if in the land of peace</span>, etc.? a second figure, the translation of which needs amending. <span class="accented">If</span> (<span class="accented">only</span>) <span class="accented">in a land of peace thou art confident</span>, <span class="accented">how wilt thou do in the pride of Jordan?</span> The "pride of Jordan" means the thickets on its banks, which were notorious as the haunts of lions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm">Zechariah 11:3</a>). " Lions' bones have been found by Dr. Roth in the gravel of the Jordan. Lions are seldom or never found now west of the Euphrates, although they occasionally cross the river" (Revelation W. Houghton, 'Bible Educator,' 1:22). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 When we are most in the dark concerning God's dispensations, we must keep up right thoughts of God, believing that he never did the least wrong to any of his creatures. When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.</body></html>
