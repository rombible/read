Here the image (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-3.htm" title="The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.">Jeremiah 6:3</a>) is that of the <span class= "ital">shepherds </span>of a wild, nomadic tribe (who represent the Chaldean and other invaders), breaking down the fence of the vineyard, and taking in their flocks to browse upon the tender shoots of the vine. The thought is the same as that of the "boar out of the wood" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-13.htm" title="The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.">Psalm 80:13</a>, but the "shepherds" are introduced to bring in the thought of the organisation and systematic plan of destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Another simpler and more natural image, expressing the same idea, as these in Ver. 9. The favorite way of representing Jehovah's relation to his people is that of a vine-proprietor to his vineyard (see on Jeremiah 2:21). How would a vineyard be ruined if a band of shepherds were to drive their flocks among the tender vine-shoots! <span class="cmt_word">The many pastors</span> (or, <span class="accented">shepherds</span>) are clearly Nebuchadnezzar and his generals (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My pleasant portion</span>. Jehovah is the "portion" of his people; his people and its land are the "portion" of Jehovah (see on Jeremiah 10:16). The epithet "pleasant" expresses the emotion of the surprised speaker. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-13 God's people had been the dearly-beloved of his soul, precious in his sight, but they acted so, that he gave them up to their enemies. Many professing churches become like speckled birds, presenting a mixture of religion and the world, with its vain fashions, pursuits, and pollutions. God's people are as men wondered at, as a speckled bird; but this people had by their own folly made themselves so; and the beasts and birds are called to prey upon them. The whole land would be made desolate. But until the judgments were actually inflicted, none of the people would lay the warning to heart. When God's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, they shall be made to feel. Silver and gold shall not profit in the day of the Lord's anger. And the efforts of sinners to escape misery, without repentance and works answerable thereto, will end in confusion.</body></html>
