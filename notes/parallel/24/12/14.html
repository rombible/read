In the midst of his burning indignation against the sins of his own people the prophet is still a patriot, and is yet more indignant at those who attack her.

In the case of Judah, however, to be "plucked out" is a mercy as well as a judgment, considering who they are "out of" whose "midst" the Jews are "plucked." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:14-17 The Lord would plead the cause of his people against their evil neighbours.
