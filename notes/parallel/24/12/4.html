For the wickedness of them that dwell therein, cattle and birds perish, for, say they, he </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the prophet) <span class= "ital">will not see our latter end </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>we shall outlive him, though he prophesies our destruction). A slightly different reading, however, adopted by the LXX. and by some modern scholars, would give for the last clause, "He (God) seeth not our <span class= "ital">ways," i.e., </span>will leave us unpunished. The opening words point to a time of distress, probably of drought and famine. But out of this wretchedness, the men who were Jeremiah's enemies--the forestallers, and monopolists, and usurers of the time--continued to enrich themselves, and scornfully defied all his warnings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long</span>, etc.? The verse is decided rather differently by the Hebrew accents. The question should end at <span class="cmt_word">wither</span>, and the following words run on. <span class="cmt_word">Every field</span> should be <span class="accented">the whole field</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> open country). The connection has caused some difficulty. But drought is constantly described as a judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>), and it is a prophetic doctrine that the lower animals suffer for the fault of man. <span class="cmt_word">Because they said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because they say</span>. The speakers are the ungodly. The subject of the following verb is uncertain. Some think it is God; but when God is said to "see" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> take notice of) anything, it is always something actually existing. The subject must, therefore, be the prophet, of whom the ungodly scoffingly declare, <span class="cmt_word">He shall not see our last end,</span> because his predictions are mere delusions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 When we are most in the dark concerning God's dispensations, we must keep up right thoughts of God, believing that he never did the least wrong to any of his creatures. When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.</body></html>
