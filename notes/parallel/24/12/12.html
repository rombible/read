The sword of the Chaldean invader was, after all, His sword. The thought was more or less the common inheritance of Israel, but it had recently received a special prominence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm" title="If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>.<p><span class= "bld">No flesh</span> <span class= "bld">shall have peace.</span>--The context limits the prediction to the offenders of the cities of Judah. As peace was for the Israelite the sum and substance of all blessedness, so its absence was the extremest of all maledictions. "Flesh" is used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>, for man's nature as evil and corrupt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon an high places thresh the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon all bare heights in the wilderness</span> (see on Jeremiah 3:2). Hardly with a reference to their pollution by idolatry; the mention of "the wilderness" (or pasture-country) suggests that it is merely a feature in the impoverishment of the country (a contrast to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-9.htm">Isaiah 49:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sword of the Lord shall devour</span>; rather, the Lord hath a <span class="accented">sword which devoureth</span>. It is the heavenly sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>), the symbol of Divine vengeance (see below on Jeremiah 46:5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-13 God's people had been the dearly-beloved of his soul, precious in his sight, but they acted so, that he gave them up to their enemies. Many professing churches become like speckled birds, presenting a mixture of religion and the world, with its vain fashions, pursuits, and pollutions. God's people are as men wondered at, as a speckled bird; but this people had by their own folly made themselves so; and the beasts and birds are called to prey upon them. The whole land would be made desolate. But until the judgments were actually inflicted, none of the people would lay the warning to heart. When God's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, they shall be made to feel. Silver and gold shall not profit in the day of the Lord's anger. And the efforts of sinners to escape misery, without repentance and works answerable thereto, will end in confusion.</body></html>
