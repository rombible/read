In words in which the natural impatience of suffering shows itself as clearly as in the complaints of Psalms 69, 109, he asks that the judgment may be immediate, open, terrible. As if recalling the very phrase which he had himself but lately used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-19.htm" title="But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.">Jeremiah 11:19</a>), he prays that they too may be as "sheep for the slaughter," <span class= "ital">dragged </span>or <span class= "ital">torn away </span>from their security to the righteous penalty of their wrong.<p><span class= "bld">Prepare.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">devote. </span>The Hebrew word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm" title="Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.

But the verb need mean no more than "separate" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Jeremiah 6:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prepare them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">consecrate them</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> victims for the sacrifice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 When we are most in the dark concerning God's dispensations, we must keep up right thoughts of God, believing that he never did the least wrong to any of his creatures. When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.</body></html>
