To be led by her example of faith and holiness, instead of leading her to acknowledge Baal by like forms of speech as they had done, was the ideal state of the nations round about her. In this hope the prophet was echoing that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm" title="And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Micah 4:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Israel has been converted and restored, and if the other nations follow his example and <span class="cmt_word">swear by my name</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> adopt the religion of Jehovah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>), they shall be rewarded by being suffered to dwell safely in Israel's midst.
