The rendering, indeed, must be modified. <span class="cmt_word">Let me talk with thee of thy judgments</span> should rather be, <span class="accented">yet will I debate questions of right with thee</span>. The questions remind us of those of Job in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21.htm">Job 21, 24</a>. Thus to have been the recipient of special Divine revelations, and to be in close communion with God, gives no security against the occasional ingress of doubting thoughts and spiritual distress. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore are all they happy</span>, etc.? rather, secure. The statement must be qualified by what follows. In the general calamity the wicked still fare the best. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 When we are most in the dark concerning God's dispensations, we must keep up right thoughts of God, believing that he never did the least wrong to any of his creatures. When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.</body></html>
