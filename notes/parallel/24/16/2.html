With them marriage, and the hopes which it involved, was not only a happiness but a duty, and to be cut off from it was to renounce both, because the evil that was coming on the nation was such as to turn both into a curse. We may compare cur Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-19.htm" title="And woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!">Matthew 24:19</a> and those spoken to the daughters of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-29.htm" title="For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never gave suck.">Luke 23:29</a>), and what, in part at least, entered into St. Paul's motives for a like abstinence on account of "the present distress" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.">1Corinthians 7:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not take thee a wife</span>. So St. Paul, "I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>, Revised Version); and Hosea has already drawn an awful picture of "Ephraim bringing forth his children to the murderer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a>). In ordinary times it was a kind of unwritten law among the Israelites to marry and beget children. Most of the prophets (e.g. Isaiah) appear to have been married. <span class="cmt_word">In this place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the land of Judah. A Jeremianic phrase (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to see his country ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.</body></html>
