he shall restore double.">Exodus 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm" title="If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.">Exodus 22:7</a>). The words threaten accordingly a full punishment according to the utmost rigour. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm" title="Speak you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.">Isaiah 40:2</a> the same thought is presented in its brighter aspect. Israel has received "double for all her sins," and therefore, having paid, as it were, "the uttermost farthing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-26.htm" title="Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out there, till you have paid the uttermost farthing.">Matthew 5:26</a>), she may now hope for mercy.<p><span class= "bld">The carcases . . .</span>--The word may be used in scorn of the lifeless form of the dumb idols which the people worshipped, to touch which was to be polluted, as by contact with a corpse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11</a>); but it more probably points to the dead bodies of the victims that had been sacrificed to them. The phrase occurs also in a like context in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm" title="And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.">Leviticus 26:30</a>.

But none of the sins of sinners can be hidden from God, or shall be overlooked by him. He will find out and raise up instruments of his wrath, that shall destroy the Jews, by fraud like fishers, by force like hunters. The prophet, rejoicing at the hope of mercy to come, addressed the Lord as his strength and refuge. The deliverance out of captivity shall be a figure of the great salvation to be wrought by the Messiah. The nations have often known the power of Jehovah in his wrath; but they shall know him as the strength of his people, and their refuge in time of trouble.</body></html>
