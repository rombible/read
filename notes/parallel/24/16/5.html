So the Vulg. gives here <span class= "ital">domus convivii, </span>and the LXX. the Greek word for a "drinking party." The word literally means a "shout," and is so far applicable to either joy or sorrow. The context seems decisive in favour of the latter meaning, but the idea of the "feast" or "social gathering" should be, at least, recognised. Not to go into the house of mirth would be a light matter as compared with abstaining even from visits of sympathy and condolence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-4.htm" title="The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.">Ecclesiastes 7:4</a> the Hebrew gives a different word.<p><span class= "bld">My peace.</span>--The word is used in its highest power, as including all other blessings.

Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>).

It is, no doubt, the wail of mourning relatives which is meant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to see his country ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.</body></html>
