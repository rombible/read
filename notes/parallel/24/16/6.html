<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm" title="They shall not make baldness on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.">Leviticus 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>), probably in order to draw a line of demarcation between Israel and the nations round, among whom such practices prevailed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm" title="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.">1Kings 18:28</a>). Both, however, seem to have been common, and probably had gained in frequency under Ahaz and Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm" title="Cut off your hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.">Jeremiah 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm" title="That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 41:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-18.htm" title="They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.">Ezekiel 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm" title="And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm" title="Make you bald, and poll you for your delicate children; enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you.">Micah 1:16</a>). The "baldness" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>shaving the crown of the head) seems to have been the more common of the two.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald</span>. Both practices are forbidden in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>), but the prohibition was at any rate unknown to the masses (see, for the former, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; and for the latter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>, "The Lord Jehovah called... to baldness;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-18.htm">Ezekiel 7:18</a>). St. Jerome remarks, and incidentally gives a valuable evidence of the tenacity of primitive customs, "Mos hic fuit apud veteres, et usque hodie in quibusdam permanet Judaerum, ut in luctibus incidant lacertos," etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to see his country ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.</body></html>
