The prophet speaks with the sense that the words are not his own, and yet what he utters is, at first, the expression of his own horror and astonishment at the vision of woe that is opening before his eyes. He sees, as it were, the famine-stricken people, their faces gathering blackness, the strong men giving way to a woman's anguish, wailing with their hands on their loins. In horror rather than in scorn, he asks the question, What means all this? Are these men in the pangs of childbirth? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-31.htm" title="For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that mourns herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.">Jeremiah 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm" title="We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm" title="What will you say when he shall punish you? for you have taught them to be captains, and as chief over you: shall not sorrows take you, as a woman in travail?">Jeremiah 13:21</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/lamentations/2-19.htm" title="Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out your heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.">Lamentations 2:19-22</a> we have a fuller picture of a like scene. By some commentators the three verses (5-7) are referred to the alarm caused in Babylon by the advance of Cyrus, and "that day" is the day of his capture of the city, but there seems no sufficient reason for such an interpretation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> - The great judgment of Israel's deliverance. It is nothing less than the "day of Jehovah" which the prophet sees in spirit - a day which is "great" (ver. 7; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>) and terrible (vers. 5, 6; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>) for Israel, a day of "trouble" (ver. 7), but for his enemies of destruction. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A voice of trembling;</span> rather, a <span class="accented">sound of trembling</span>, a sound causing men to tremble; doubtless it is "the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of fear, and not of peace;</span> rather, there is <span class="accented">fear, and no peace.</span> "Peace," as usual, means the harmony of a well ordered, secure, and peaceful community. Literally, it is <span class="accented">wholeness</span>; its opposite is "breaking," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> outward ruin and inward anguish. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-11 Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.</body></html>
