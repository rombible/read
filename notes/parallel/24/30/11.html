yet will I not make a full end.">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm" title="Go you up on her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.">Jeremiah 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm" title="Nevertheless in those days, said the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.">Jeremiah 5:18</a>. It is eminently characteristic of the prophets of Jeremiah's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?">Ezekiel 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-17.htm" title="Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.">Ezekiel 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nahum/1-8.htm" title="But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.">Nahum 1:8-9</a>). Here the thought, implied elsewhere, and reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-28.htm" title="Fear you not, O Jacob my servant, said the LORD: for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you: but I will not make a full end of you, but correct you in measure; yet will I not leave you wholly unpunished.">Jeremiah 46:28</a>, is expressed more fully than before, that while the destruction of the national life of the heathen nations on whom judgment was to fall should be complete and irreversible, so that Moab, Ammon, Edom, should no more have a place in the history of the world, the punishment of Israel should be remedial as well as retributive, working out, in due time, a complete restitution. In "correcting in measure" we trace an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-1.htm" title="O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.">Psalm 6:1</a> (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm" title="O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.">Jeremiah 10:24</a>). That thought sustains the prophet in his contemplation of the captivity and apparent ruin of his people. To be left "altogether unpunished" would be, as in the "let him alone "of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-17.htm" title="Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.">Hosea 4:17</a>, the most terrible of all punishments.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In measure;</span> rather, <span class="accented">according to what is just</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not capriciously, to satisfy a feeling of revenge such as the untaught mind is apt to ascribe to God (see on Jeremiah 10:24). <span class="cmt_word">And will not,</span> etc.; rather, for <span class="accented">I cannot.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-11 Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.</body></html>
