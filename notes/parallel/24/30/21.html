The word is the same as the "excellent" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm" title="O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth! who have set your glory above the heavens.">Psalm 8:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me?</span>--The question points to the ruler of the house of David whom the prophet sees in visions--in other words, to the far-off Messiah. So in Isaiah we have a like introduction of the figure of the conqueror, "Who is this that cometh from Edom?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1</a>). As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, the dominant thought is that of one who will not be treacherous or faithless, like the degenerate heirs of the house of David whom Jeremiah had known, but one who would "engage" (literally, <span class= "ital">pledge, </span>or <span class= "ital">give as security</span>) his heart and soul to the service of Jehovah. In the advent of such a king the true relation between God and His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm" title="And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return to me with their whole heart.">Jeremiah 24:7</a>) should yet be re-established. In the words "to approach unto me" we have the germ of the thought that the true King will also be a priest, and will enter, as others could not enter, into the Holy Place (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm" title="And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.">Numbers 16:5</a>); a priest, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a> had spoken of, after the order of Melchizedek.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The future rulers of Israel shall be of the native stock, not foreign tyrants. <span class="cmt_word">Their nobles;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his noble one</span>, a synonym for "his ruler," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the (earthly) king of Israel. It is remarkable that no reference is made here to the Messiah, who, in fact, is not as conspicuous a figure in the prophecies of Jeremiah as in those of Isaiah. And yet even in Isaiah there is one striking prophecy in which the inspired seer uses language not (in the hands of a literalist) reconcilable with the prospect of the personal Messiah. The Messiah appears, as it were, in a lightning flash, and then disappears for a time. The prophecy of Isaiah referred to is <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1, 2</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>), in which the prospect of a truly God-fearing king, with princes of the same high character, entirely occupies the mind of the writer. "Nothing indicates that the Messiah is intended; king and princes are placed quite on a level, in accordance with the actual state of things under the so called monarchy." <span class="cmt_word">And I will cause him to draw near.</span> It is doubtful whether Israel or Israel's ruler is referred to. A priestly relation (such as "drawing near" implies, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>) might be predicated of either, at any rate in the regenerate form of the Israelitish commonwealth; but it is more natural to suppose the ruler to be here indicated, for it is scarcely descriptive enough to say that he shall belong to the chosen people. <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that engaged his heart;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that pledgeth his heart</span> (or, <span class="accented">courage</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that ventureth. The rejection of thee old line of Davidic kings might well raise the thought that the intimate relation between Jehovah and his earthly representative for Israel, promised of old to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), could no longer be hoped for. But with this renewed promise the kings of the new Davidic line may venture to "draw near;" otherwise - who is he <span class="accented">that ventureth?</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:18-24 We have here further intimations of the favour of God for them after the days of their calamity have expired. The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as the High Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance with his Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. I will be your God: it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God will comfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must have their hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith. How will they escape who neglect so great salvation?</body></html>
