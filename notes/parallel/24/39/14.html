It seems likely that, at first, he was sent back to the prison where he had been found, till he could be placed under the protection of Gedaliah.<p><span class= "bld">Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan.</span>--The reason of the choice lies almost on the surface. Gedaliah was the representative of a house which for three generations had been true to the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Shaphan had been the king's scribe in the early years of Josiah, and had taken an active part in the restoration of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2Kings 22:3-7</a>). He was the first to read the newly-found lost copy of the Law, which we identify with the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.">2Kings 22:8-14</a>), and his son Ahikam acted with him. The latter protected Jeremiah in the reign of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a>). His brother Gemariah gave the prophet the use of his chamber in the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>), and tried to turn aside the king's wrath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>). And now the son of Ahikam appears as the prophet's friend and protector.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Gedaliah, whose father had already befriended the prophet on a serious occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), and who, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, had been appointed (though himself a Jew) Babylonian "governor over the cities of Judah," is directed to <span class="cmt_word">carry him</span> (Jeremiah) <span class="cmt_word">home</span>, or rather, <span class="accented">into the house</span>; obviously some house close by is meant - either Gedaliah's temporary dwelling or the royal palace. This statement conflicts (see introduction) with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1-5</a>, but only as to the time when Jeremiah was liberated. The latter narrative being more explicit, deserves the preference. Thus Jeremiah <span class="cmt_word">dwelt among the people;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> could go in and out at his pleasure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:11-14 The servants of God alone are prepared for all events; and they are delivered and comforted, while the wicked suffer. They often meet with more kindness from the profane, than from hypocritical professors of godliness. The Lord will raise them up friends, do them good, and perform all his promises.</body></html>
