It was a well-known city at the time of the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm" title="So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm" title="From mount Hor you shall point out your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:">Numbers 34:8</a>), and in that of David was the capital of a kingdom, which became tributary to him and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-10.htm" title="Then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.

Riblah (still retaining its name, <span class= "ital">Ribleh</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>also on the Orontes, and near its source, was a centre from which the great lines of traffic led by the Euphrates to Nineveh, by Palmyra <span class= "ital">to </span>Babylon, by Lebanon and the coast to Palestine and Egypt, and through the Jordan valley to the Holy Land. It was, therefore, a natural post of observation for the Chaldaean king while his generals were carrying on the sieges of Tyre and Jerusalem. So when Pharaoh-necho was for a time, before the battle of Carchemish, master of the Assyrian territory, it was to Riblah that he summoned Jehoahaz, and there imprisoned him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.">2Kings 23:33</a>). In this instance Zedekiah was brought before Nebuchadnezzar as a vassal prince who, having received his authority from the Chaldaean king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a>), had rebelled, and met with scant mercy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-10 Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed the enemy could never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw his protection, and then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had his eyes put out; so he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyes against the clear light of God's word. Those who will not believe God's words, will be convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes of Providence, how uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the just dealings of Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich, nothing will profit them while they cleave to their sins.</body></html>
