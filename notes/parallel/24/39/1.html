A fuller narrative of the siege and capture is given in Jeremiah 52. The two verses which open the chapter seem to have been inserted here by the editor of the prophecies in their present form, as explaining the fact with which Jeremiah 38 had closed. The siege had lasted eighteen months, beginning in B.C. 590 and ending B.C. 588. It came to an end, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm" title="And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.">Jeremiah 52:6</a>, through the pressure of the famine, of which we have seen traces in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.">Jeremiah 37:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-10 Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed the enemy could never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw his protection, and then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had his eyes put out; so he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyes against the clear light of God's word. Those who will not believe God's words, will be convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes of Providence, how uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the just dealings of Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich, nothing will profit them while they cleave to their sins.</body></html>
