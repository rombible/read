Here an open space, originally used as a <span class= "ital">forum, </span>or place of judgment, now gave the Chaldaean generals a central encampment, from which they could command both quarters of the city, and by taking their place in the heart of its life, formally assert their mastery. Each of the names that follow has a meaning and history of its own.<p><span class= "bld">Nergal-sharezer.</span>--The first half of the name appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-30.htm" title="And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,">2Kings 17:30</a> as that of a Cuthite, or Assyrian deity, and means the "great hero." It occurs frequently in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser and Assur-banipal (<span class= "ital">e.g., Records of the Past, </span>i. 77, 103). The whole name appears in Assyrian monuments as Nergal-shar-uzur. Two of the generals mentioned here bore the same name, and each apparently was distinguished by a special title.<p><span class= "bld">Samgar?nebo.</span>--Here the second half is the name of a Babylonian deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm" title="Against Moab thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.">Jeremiah 48:1</a>), possibly connected with the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Nabi </span>(= prophet), and so answering to the Egyptian Thoth and the Greek Hermes. The great temple at Borsippa, known as <span class= "ital">Birs Nimroud, </span>was dedicated to him (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 77). The first half has been explained by some scholars as meaning "warrior," by others as "cupbearer," and so equivalent to Rabshakeh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm" title="And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.">Isaiah 36:2</a>), and as such is attached to the foregoing name of Nergal-sharezer. As a rule, the name of Nebo appears always in the beginning of compound words, as in Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzar-adan, &c.; and probably we should connect it here with the name that follows.<p><span class= "bld">Sarsechim, Rab-saris.</span>--Probably, as indicated in the previous Note, the name should stand as Nebo-sarsechim. The two names go together, the first as a proper name, the second as a title, meaning "the chief eunuch." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13</a>, Nebushasban appears as bearing the same title. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm" title="And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.">2Kings 18:17</a> it appears simply as a title, as in Rabshakeh we have "the chief cupbearer."<p><span class= "bld">Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag.</span>--Here also the second name is the title of office, meaning probably "chief of the Magi," or "chief of the priests." The man thus named, who appears on the Assyrian monuments as <span class= "ital">Nergal-shar-uzur Rubu-emga, </span>played a prominent part afterwards as murdering Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, whose sister he had married. He reigned for three or four years, and appears in Berosus (Joseph. <span class= "ital">100 Apion, </span>i. 20) under the name of Neriglissar. The older name is found on the bricks of a palace at Babylon, on the right bank of the Euphrates (Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. of Bible. </span>Art. <span class= "ital">Nergal-sharezer</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the princes,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">That all the princes</span>, etc. (see on Jeremiah 38:28). The fact mentioned in this verse is not recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>; ch. 52; and its preciseness is a considerable pledge of its accuracy. The princes are four in number, and two of them have official titles attached. <span class="cmt_word">Nergal-sharezer</span> is the Hebraized form of Nirgal-sarra-ucur, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Nirgal (or Nergal), protect (or perhaps, has created) the king" - the name, as often, is a prayer. <span class="cmt_word">Samgar-nebo</span> is probably a modification of Sumgir-nabu, "Be gracious, Nebo;" but it has not yet been found in the inscriptions. <span class="cmt_word">Sarsechim</span> has the appearance of being corrupt; the first part, however, may, perhaps, be the Babylonian for "king" ("prince" in Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">Rab-saris</span> has a meaning in Hebrew - "chief of the eunuchs;" but the analogies of "Rab-mag" and "Rab-shakeh" suggest that it is merely the Hebraized form of some Assyrian title. In any case, it would be better to render "the Rab-saris," and to attach it closely to the preceding name, Sarsechim being himself the official called Rab-saris (see, however, ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Rab-mag.</span> This was "one of the highest titles in the state" (G. Smith). The etymology of the latter half of the phrase is uncertain; for the connection of "mag" with "Magi" is a mistake which has been exposed by Dr. Schrader, in his work, 'Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament' (of which a translation is announced). The native form of the name may be <span class="accented">rubu emga</span> (Schrader) or <span class="accented">rubu makhe</span> (Friedr. Delitzsch), and the whole title will mean "high priest" or "chief of the sorcerers" (comp. Delitzsch, "The Hebrew Language viewed in the Light of Assyrian Research," Lond., 1883, p. 14). "The Rab-mag" would be more accurate, and the title ought to be attached to the preceding name, Nergal-sharezer. As a matter of fact, a Nirgal-sarra-ucur, who held the office of <span class="accented">rubu emga, is</span> mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions, and we may plausibly conjecture that he is the person here mentioned among the "princes." He was afterwards raised to the throne by the conspirators who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar (he is better known as Neriglissar). It is singular that two Nergal-sharezers should be here mentioned; possibly the first mention is due to a mistake. The names are hardly recognizable in the Septuagint. The "princes" took up their station <span class="cmt_word">in the middle gate.</span> The "breach" spoken of in ver. 2 enabled the Babylonians to occupy the whole of the lower city to the northeast of Zion. The "middle gate" probably separated these two parts of Jerusalem, and those who were posted there commanded the temple and the citadel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-10 Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed the enemy could never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw his protection, and then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had his eyes put out; so he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyes against the clear light of God's word. Those who will not believe God's words, will be convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes of Providence, how uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the just dealings of Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich, nothing will profit them while they cleave to their sins.</body></html>
