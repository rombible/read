(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm" title="I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.">Psalm 31:12</a>.) The question implies an affirmative answer. The prophet speaks as identifying himself with those who gazed with wonder and pity at the doom which fell on one so young, and yet not the less does he pronounce that doom to be inevitable.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is this man Coniah</span>, etc.? The prophet's human feelings are stirred; he cannot withhold his sympathy from the sad fate of his king. What! he exclaims; is it possible that this Coniah is treated as a piece of ill-wrought pottery ware (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm">Jeremiah 18:4</a>), and "hurled" into a strange land? <span class="cmt_word">He and his seed</span>. These words have caused some difficulty, owing to the youth, of Jehoiachin. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a> he was only eighteen when he was carried captive, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> makes him still younger, only eight (Josiah's age on his accession). Hitzig thinks the latter number is to be preferred; his chief reasons are the prominence given to the queen-mother, and the fact that the length of Jehoiachin's reign is given with more precise accuracy in 2 Chronicles than in 2 Kings. It is true that the king's wives are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. But that he had wives may, according to Hitzig, have been inferred by the late compiler of Kings from the passage before us; or the "wives" may have been those of Jehoiachin's predecessor (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). Graf's conjecture is, perhaps, the safest view of the case, whether we accept the number eighteen or the number eight; it is that the "seed" spoken of as born to Jehoiachin in his captivity, and is reckoned to him by anticipation. It should be mentioned, however, that the Septuagint omits "he and his seed" altogether. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:20-30 The Jewish state is described under a threefold character. Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in! But those who hear the voice of Christ, and follow him, have eternal life, and shall never perish, neither shall any enemy pluck them out of his almighty hands.</body></html>
