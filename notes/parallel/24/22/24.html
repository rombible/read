The name of this prince appears in three forms :--(1) The abbreviated Coniah, as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm" title="And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.">Jeremiah 37:1</a> : this was probably the name by which he was known before he was proclaimed as king. (2) Jeconiah, with slight variations, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-20.htm" title="Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 27:20</a>, and elsewhere. (3) Jehoiachin, also with varied spelling--probably the regal title assumed on his accession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>). The meaning of the name "Jehovah establishes" is constant in all the forms. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm" title="Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.">2Kings 24:8</a> he is said to have been eighteen years old when he began to reign. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm" title="Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.">2Chronicles 36:9</a> the age is given as eight. The latter is obviously an error of transcription. His reign lasted for three months only. There is probably a touch of scorn, as in the case of Shallum, in the prophet's use of the earlier name instead of that which he had assumed as king.<p><span class= "bld">The signet upon my right hand.</span>--The seal-ring was, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-23.htm" title="In that day, said the LORD of hosts, will I take you, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, said the LORD, and will make you as a signet: for I have chosen you, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:23</a>, the symbol of kingly power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm" title="And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-10.htm" title="And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.">Esther 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-2.htm" title="And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.">Esther 8:2</a>), authenticating every edict, and was therefore the type of all that was most precious. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-6.htm" title="Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame.">Song of Solomon 8:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Coniah</span>. A shorter form of Jeconiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>), found again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>. Perhaps this was the name this king bore prior to his accession, after which it was certainly Jehoiachin; Jeremiah has already spoken of one king by his earlier name in ver. 11. The Divine speaker solemnly announces that though, as the representative of Israel's invisible King, Coniah <span class="cmt_word">were</span> - or rather, be - <span class="cmt_word">the signet upon</span> <span class="cmt_word">his right hand</span> (a most valued jewel), yet would - or rather, <span class="accented">will</span> - he pluck him thence; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> depose him from his high dignity. The same figure is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>, "I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, and make thee as a signet;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>, where there is a well-attested reading, "Thou (O King of Type) art a deftly made signet-ring." (For the fulfillment of the prediction in this verse, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:20-30 The Jewish state is described under a threefold character. Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in! But those who hear the voice of Christ, and follow him, have eternal life, and shall never perish, neither shall any enemy pluck them out of his almighty hands.</body></html>
