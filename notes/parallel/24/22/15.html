A various reading, followed by the LXX., gives, "thou viest with Ahaz," or "Ahab," probably, in this latter case, with reference to the ivory palace built by that king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">1Kings 22:39</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Did not thy father eat and drink . . .?</span>--The words are obviously those of praise, and paint a healthy, blameless enjoyment like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm" title="There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; like those, we may add, which the Son of Man used to describe the outward portion of His own life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>). Josiah was not an ascetic, devotee king, but lived his life happily, and did his work--the true kingly work of judgment and justice--well. There was a truer greatness in that than in the stateliness of Jehoiakim's palaces. "Then it was well with him" s repeated with the emphasis of iteration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou reign</span> - rather, dost <span class="accented">thou reign</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dost thou prove thy royal qualities) - <span class="cmt_word">because thou closest thyself in cedar</span>? The second part of the clause must at any rate be. altered. Some render, "because thou viest (with thy forefathers) in cedar" (i.e. in building cedar palaces). Hitzig would strike out "in cedar," as having intruded from the preceding line (such a phenomenon meets us occasionally in the received Hebrew text), but this does not help us to a 'connected translation of the passage. Graf's rendering is grammatical, and not against usage; it is, "Dost thou reign because thou art eager about cedar-wood?" and yet the impression left on the mind is that there is some error in the text. The Septuagint finds a reference to one of Jehoiakim's predecessors, "because thou viest with Ahaz" (so the Vatican Codex), or, "... with Ahab" (so the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic or Friderico-Augustan). The latter king is celebrated in the Old Testament on account of his buildings, especially his ivory palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>:39). The former was at any rate addicted to the imitation of foreign ways (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did not thy father eat and drink?</span> There was no call upon Jehoiakim to live the life of a Nazarite. "Eating and drinking," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enjoying the good things within his reach, was perfectly admissible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>); indeed, the Old Testament view of life is remarkable for its healthy naturalness. There was, however, one peremptory condition, itself as much in accordance with nature as with the Law of God, that the rights of other men should be studiously regarded. Josiah "ate and drank," but he also "did judgment and justice," and so "it was well with him." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:10-19 Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wicked sons of a very pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.</body></html>
