The body of the king was "to be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost." We have no direct record of its fulfilment, but its reproduction shows that the prophet's word had not failed. The king was dragged in chains with the other captives, who were being carried off to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-6.htm" title="Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.">2Chronicles 36:6</a>), and probably died on the journey, his corpse left behind unburied as the army marched.

So Ahab, who died in battle, "slept with his fathers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-40.htm" title="So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.">1Kings 22:40</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Jehoiakim's miserable death, without even the honor of burial. The prediction is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>, where the statement is made in plain language. At first sight it appears to conflict with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>, "So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead;" but it is only appearance, and when we remember that the complete formula for describing the natural death of a king of Judah is, "slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-24.htm">1 Kings 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-50.htm">1 Kings 22:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-24.htm">2 Kings 8:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-7.htm">2 Kings 15:7, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-20.htm">2 Kings 16:20</a>), and that the phrase, "slept with his fathers," is used of Ahab, who fell on the field of battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-40.htm">1 Kings 22:40</a>), we are naturally led to the conjecture that Jehoiakim did not die a natural death, but fell in battle in some sally made by the besieged. <span class="cmt_word">Buried with the burial of an ass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cast out unburied. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond the gates;</span> rather, <span class="accented">far from the gates</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:10-19 Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wicked sons of a very pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.</body></html>
