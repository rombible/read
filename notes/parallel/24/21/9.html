and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>. They were, however, acted on by not a few (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.">Jeremiah 52:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">His life shall be unto him for a prey.</span>--The phrase is characteristic of Jeremiah, and forcibly illustrates the misery of the time. Life itself was not a secure possession, but as the spoil which a man seizes on the field of battle, and with which he hastens away, lest another should deprive him of it. It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-18.htm" title="For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey to you: because you have put your trust in me, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 39:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm" title="And seek you great things for yourself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, said the LORD: but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.">Jeremiah 45:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that abideth in this city</span>, etc. No doubt Jeremiah often gave this counsel to his fellow-citizens (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1, 17</a>), and it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>, that many of the Jews acted in accordance with it. <span class="cmt_word">Falleth</span>; more distinctly, <span class="accented">falleth away</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-14.htm">Jeremiah 37:14</a>, Authorized Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> goeth over to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 When the siege had begun, Zedekiah sent to ask of Jeremiah respecting the event. In times of distress and danger, men often seek those to counsel and pray for them, whom, at other times, they despise and oppose; but they only seek deliverance from punishment. When professors continue in disobedience, presuming upon outward privileges, let them be told that the Lord will prosper his open enemies against them. As the king and his princes would not surrender, the people are exhorted to do so. No sinner on earth is left without a Refuge, who really desires one; but the way of life is humbling, it requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties.</body></html>
