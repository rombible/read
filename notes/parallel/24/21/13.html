and, as in "the daughter of Zion" for Zion itself, describes the lower city of Jerusalem, Isaiah's "valley of vision" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm" title="The burden of the valley of vision. What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?">Isaiah 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm" title="For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.">Isaiah 22:5</a>), the Tyrop?on of Josephus. The "rock of the plain" (comp.

The king and his people trusted, as the Jebusites had done of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm" title="And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.">2Samuel 5:8</a>), in what seemed to them the impregnable strength of their natural position. There seems no adequate reason for taking the words as symbolising the kingly house of Judah, but it is probable enough that local associations, palaces on the hill or in the valley, may have given the words a specially pointed application.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Jehovah, standing, as it were, on the Mount of Olives, addresses the proud city beneath him. <span class="cmt_word">O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">O inhabitress</span>; Jerusalem is personified as a virgin. The poetical description of the capital as a "valley" (the word, however, signifies a valley as wide as a plain) reminds us of "the valley [or rather, 'ravine'] of vision" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1, 5</a>); While "the rock of the plain" recalls "my mountain in the field" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>). So, as Graf points out, Babylon is called "a mountain" in metaphorical language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>). It is, however, singular that the prophet should call Jerusalem a "valley" and a "rock" in the same passage. In the former, perhaps, Jeremiah is thinking specially of the lower city, and in the latter of Mount Zion. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall come down against us</span>? viz. from the "hills round about Jerusalem." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:11-14 The wickedness of the king and his family was the worse because of their relation to David. They were urged to act with justice, at once, lest the Lord's anger should be unquenchable. If God be for us, who can be against us? But if he be against us, who can do any thing for us?</body></html>
