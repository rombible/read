Thus far we have had his ministry under Jehoiakim, the roll which was read before that king, and formed the first part of his work. Now we pass to the later stage, which forms what has been called the roll of Zedekiah. The judgment predicted in the previous roll had come nearer. The armies of Nebuchadnezzar were gathering round the city. The prophet was now honoured and consulted, and the king sent his chief minister, Pashur (<span class= "ital">not </span>the priest who had been the prophet's persecutor, as in the preceding chapter, but the head of the family or course of Melchiah), and Zephaniah, the "second priest," or deputy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">Jeremiah 52:24</a>, to ask his intercession. We learn from their later history that they were in their hearts inclined to the policy of resistance, and ready to accuse Jeremiah of being a traitor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/38-1.htm" title="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 38:1-4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pashur</span>. A different Pashur from the one mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>. This one reappears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>; he belonged to the fifteenth of the sacerdotal families, named after Melchiah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Zephaniah</span>, mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>. He was of the priestly family or class of Maaseiah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-18.htm">1 Chronicles 24:18</a>), and was next in rank to the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 When the siege had begun, Zedekiah sent to ask of Jeremiah respecting the event. In times of distress and danger, men often seek those to counsel and pray for them, whom, at other times, they despise and oppose; but they only seek deliverance from punishment. When professors continue in disobedience, presuming upon outward privileges, let them be told that the Lord will prosper his open enemies against them. As the king and his princes would not surrender, the people are exhorted to do so. No sinner on earth is left without a Refuge, who really desires one; but the way of life is humbling, it requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties.</body></html>
