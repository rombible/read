To rise at dawn of day, to sit in the gate and listen to the complaints of those who had been wronged, was the surest way to gain the affection of his people. It was David's neglect of this that gave an opening for the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm" title="And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.">2Samuel 15:2</a>). Solomon's early fame for wisdom rested on his discharge of this duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-28.htm" title="And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.">1Kings 3:28</a>). If the king remained slothfully in his palace in those golden hours of morning, the noon-tide heat made it impossible for him to retrieve the lost opportunity. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-5.htm" title="And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.">2Samuel 4:5</a>.) Still worse was it when, as with luxurious and sensual kings, the morning hours were given to revelry and feasting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm" title="Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!">Ecclesiastes 10:16-17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O house of David</span>. The "house of David" here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-13.htm">Isaiah 7:13</a>, means the various branches of the royal family, the same, in fact, which are called by courtesy "kings of Judah" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-20.htm">Jeremiah 17:20</a> (see note). They appear from the present passage to have monopolized the judicial function. <span class="cmt_word">Deliver him that is spoiled</span>, etc. The poor man would have no advocate to plead for him; in this case the judge was to see that he suffered no injustice in consequence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:11-14 The wickedness of the king and his family was the worse because of their relation to David. They were urged to act with justice, at once, lest the Lord's anger should be unquenchable. If God be for us, who can be against us? But if he be against us, who can do any thing for us?</body></html>
