The order of scribes, which became so dominant during the exile, was already rising into notice. Shaphan, to whom Hilkiah gave the re-found Book of the Law, belonged to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-15.htm" title="And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.">2Chronicles 34:15</a>), and the discovery of that book would naturally give a fresh impetus to their work. They were boasting of their position as the recognised instructors of the people.<p><span class= "bld">Lo, certainly . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Verily, lo! the lying pen of the scribes hath made it </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., the Law</span>)<span class= "ital"> as a lie. </span>The <span class= "ital">pen </span>was the iron <span class= "ital">stylus </span>made for engraving on stone or metal. The meaning of the clause is clear. The sophistry of men was turning the truth of God into a lie, and emptying it of its noblest meaning. Already, as in other things, so here, in his protest against the teaching of the scribes, with their traditional and misleading casuistry, Jeremiah appears as foreshadowing the prophet of Nazareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20-48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-2.htm" title="Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:">Matthew 23:2-26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How do ye say, We are wise</span>? Jeremiah is evidently addressing the priests and the prophets, whom he so constantly described as among the chief causes of Judah's ruin (comp. Ver. 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-9.htm">Jeremiah 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>), and who, in Isaiah's day, regarded it as an unwarrantable assumption on the part of that prophet to pretend to instruct them in their duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The law of the Lord is with us</span>. "With us;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in our hands and mouths. (comp. Psalm 1:16). The word <span class="accented">torah</span>, commonly rendered" Law," is ambiguous, and a difference of opinion as to the meaning of this verse is inevitable. Some think these self-styled "wise" men reject Jeremiah's counsels on the ground that they already have the divinely given Law in a written form (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>), and that the Divine revelation is complete. Others that <span class="accented">torah</span> here, as often elsewhere in the prophets (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>), simply means "instruction," or "direction," and describes the authoritative counsel given orally by the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>) and prophets to those who consulted them on points of ritual and practice respectively. The usage of Jeremiah himself favors the latter view (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; and especially Jeremiah 26:4, 5, where "to walk in my <span class="accented">Torah"</span> is parallel to "to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets." The context equally points in this direction. The most natural interpretation, then, is this: The opponents of Jeremiah bade him keep his exhortations to himself, seeing that they themselves were wise and the divinely appointed teachers of the people. To this Jeremiah replies, not (as the Authorized Version renders) <span class="cmt_word">Lo, certainly in vain made he it</span>, etc.; but, <span class="accented">Yea</span>, <span class="accented">behold I for a lie hath it wrought - the lying pen of the scribes</span> (so Authorized Version, margin). <span class="accented">Soferim</span> (scribes) is the term proper to all those who practiced the art of writing (<span class="accented">sefer</span>); it included, therefore, presumably at least, most, if not all, of the priests and prophets of whom Jeremiah speaks. There are indications enough that the Hebrew literature was not entirely confined to those whom we look up to as the inspired writers, and it is perfectly credible that the formalist priests and false prophets should have availed themselves of the pen as a means of giving greater currency to their teaching. Jeremiah warns his hearers to distrust a literature which is in the set-vice of false religious principles - a warning which prophets in the wider sense of the term ('The Liberty of Prophesyings') still have but too much occasion to repeat, tit is right, however, to mention another grammatically possible rendering, which is adopted by those who suppose <span class="accented">torah</span> in the preceding clause to mean the Mosaic Law: "Yea, behold, the lying pen of the scribes hath made (it) into a lie;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the professional interpreters of the Scriptures called scribes have, by their groundless comments and inferences, made the Scriptures (especially the noblest part, the Law) into a lie, so that it has ceased to represent the Divine will and teaching. The objections to this are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the necessity of supplying an object to the verb - the object would hardly have been omitted where its emission renders the meaning of the clause so doubtful; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that this view attributes to the word <span class="accented">soferim</span> a meaning which only became prevalent in the time of Ezra (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 11</a>).] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-13 What brought this ruin? 1. The people would not attend to reason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, ver. 7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well. Selfish teachers may promise peace when there is no peace; and thus men encourage each other in committing evil; but in the day of visitation they will have no refuge to flee unto.</body></html>
