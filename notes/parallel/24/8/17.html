and much people of Israel died.">Numbers 21:6</a>, or, possibly, from the connection of Dan with the "serpent" and "adder" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm" title="Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.">Genesis 49:17</a>. It is not easy to identify the genus and species of the serpents of the Bible. Here the two words are in apposition. "Cockatrice," however, cannot be right, that name belonging, as an English word, to legendary zoology. The Vulg. gives "basilisk." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-32.htm" title="At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.">Proverbs 23:32</a> it is translated by "adder." In any case it implies a hissing venomous snake (probably the <span class= "ital">cerastes </span>or <span class= "ital">serpens regulus</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the symbolism which identified it with the Assyrian or Chaldaean power had already appeared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm" title="Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.">Isaiah 14:29</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Which will not be charmed.</span>--The figure is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/58-4.htm" title="Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stops her ear;">Psalm 58:4-5</a>. The "deaf adder" that "refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer" represents an implacable enemy waging a pitiless war. Serpent-charming, as in the case of the Egyptian sorcerers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>), seems to have been from a very early time, as it is now, both in Egypt and India, one of the most prominent features of the natural magic of the East.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - A new image to intensify the impression of dreadfulness. <span class="cmt_word">Serpents, cockatrices</span>; rather, <span class="accented">serpents</span> (<span class="accented">even</span>) <span class="accented">basilisks</span>. The second noun is in apposition to the more general "serpents." "Basilisks" (<span class="accented">Serpentes regulos</span>) are the renderings of Aquila and the Vulgate. Some species of highly venomous serpent is clearly intended; more than this we cannot say. The root probably means "to hiss." Canon Tristram thinks of "a very beautifully marked yellow serpent, and the largest of the vipers found in the Holy Land," called the <span class="accented">Daboia xantheina</span>. He adds that it is one of the most dangerous ('Nat. Hist. of Palestine,' p. 275). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.</body></html>
