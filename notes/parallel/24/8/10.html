(Comp. Notes there.) It is as though that emphatic condemnation of the sins of the false teachers were burnt into his soul, and could not but find utterance whenever he addressed the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - These verses are almost the same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12-15</a>; the differences are in Ver. 10. They are omitted in the Septuagint, and Hitzig regards them as an interpolation, at any rate from the point where the present passage coincides verbally with its parallel. His grounds are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ver. 13 follows more naturally on Ver. 10 ("... them that shall inherit them") than on Ver. 12; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Ver. 10 is deficient in symmetry; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the deviations from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a> sometimes loosen the connection of the clauses, sometimes sink into the colloquial style. The arguments seem to be inconclusive. Jeremiah is apt to repeat himself (Graf refers to Ver. 14 = <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; Ver. 15 - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a> = 5:29, 9:8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a> = 11:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-41.htm">Jeremiah 50:41-43</a> = 6:22-24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:44 - 46 = 49:19-21); and the element which is common to this paragraph and to oh: 6:12-15 seems equally appropriate in both connections. It should be added, however, that the cautious and reverent block has come to the same conclusion as Hitzig.

The people would not attend to reason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, ver. 7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well. Selfish teachers may promise peace when there is no peace; and thus men encourage each other in committing evil; but in the day of visitation they will have no refuge to flee unto.</body></html>
