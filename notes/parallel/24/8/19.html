Is not her king in her?" That question is asked half in despair, and half in murmuring complaint. But Jehovah himself returns the answer, and it comes in the form of another question, "Why have they provoked me to anger . . .?" They had forsaken Him before. He forsook them now and left them, for a time, to their own ways.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because of them that dwell in</span>, etc. The Hebrew simply has "from them," etc. The prophet is transported in imam-nation to the time of the fulfillment of his prophecies. He hears the lamentation of his countrymen, who are languishing in captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the Lord in Zion</span>, etc.? is the burden of their sad complaints; "king" is a familiar synonym for "God" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>; but not <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>, which is certainly mistranslated in Authorized Version). But why" in Zion?" "Zion" was properly the name of the eastward hill at Jerusalem, where lay the oldest part of the city (called "the city of David"), and the highest portion of which was crowned by the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Why have they provoked me to anger</span>, etc.? is the reply of Jehovah, pointing out that their sufferings were but an exact retribution for their infidelity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-19.htm">Jeremiah 5:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.</body></html>
