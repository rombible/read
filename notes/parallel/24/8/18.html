Ewald and Graf suppose an ellipsis, and render, "(Oh for) my enlivening [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. an enlivening for me] in trouble!"

Do Dieu (1648) wavers between this and the view that it is an address to his wife, "Quae marito solatio est."

And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.</body></html>
