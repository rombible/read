The Hebrew name, <span class= "ital">chasideh </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">the pious bird</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>indicating its care for its young, is suggestive, as also is the phrase "in the heavens," as applied to its characteristic mode of flight. The turtle-dove appears at the approach of spring (Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-12.htm" title="The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;">Song of Solomon 2:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The crane and the swallow.</span>--In the judgment of Tristram and other modern naturalists, the words should change places, and perhaps "swift" take the place of swallow. The word for "swallow" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm" title="Yes, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.">Psalm 84:3</a> is different. The same combination meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm" title="Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.">Isaiah 38:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Judgment.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">ordinance, </span>the appointed rule of life which brute creatures obey and man transgresses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The appeal to the regularity of animal instincts reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>. Yea, the stork, etc. The minatory birds obey their instinct with the most unfailing regularity. Those referred to are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the stork, whose "regular and sudden return is one of the most interesting natural sights of Palestine. The expression 'stork in the heavens' refers to the immense height at which they fly during migration" (Tristram); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the turtle, or turtle-dove, whose return is the sure sign of spring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3 and 4)</span> the crane and the swallow, or rather, "the swift and the crane." These birds are again mentioned together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> (the psalm of Hezekiah), where special reference is made to the penetrating quality of their note. "The whooping or trumpeting of the crane rings through the night air in spring, and the vast flocks which we noticed passing north near Beersheba were a wonderful sight." The introduction of the swallow in the Authorized Version is misleading, as that bird is not a regular migrant in Palestine. The note of the swift is a shrill scream. "No bird is more conspicuous by the suddenness of its return than the swift," is the remark of Canon Tristram, who saw large flocks passing northwards over Jerusalem, on the 12th of February ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 208). It is an interesting fact that the swift bears the same name (<span class="accented">sus</span>) in the vernacular Arabic as in the Hebrew of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">The judgment</span>; better, <span class="accented">the law</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-13 What brought this ruin? 1. The people would not attend to reason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, ver. 7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well. Selfish teachers may promise peace when there is no peace; and thus men encourage each other in committing evil; but in the day of visitation they will have no refuge to flee unto.</body></html>
