Josephus mentions this balsam several times, but states that it only grew at Jericho ('Antiq.,' 15:4,2), Tristram searched for balsam in its ancient haunts, but in vain; he thinks Jeremiah means the <span class="accented">Balsamodendron gileadense</span> or <span class="accented">opobalsamum</span>, which in Arabia is used as a medicine both internally and externally. But if Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 24:22) may be followed in his wide use of the term "balsam" so as to include the exudations of the "lentisens" or mastick tree, then "balm of Gilead" is still to be found; for the mastick tree "grows commonly all over the country, excepting in the plains and the Jordan valley" ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 336). <span class="cmt_word">Is there no physician there?</span> We hear but little of physicians in the Old Testament. They are only mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> (but with reference to Egypt, where medicine was much cultivated), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>. From the two latter passages we may, perhaps, infer that physicians were rarely successful; and this is certainly the impression produced by Ecclus. 38:15, "He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician." The remedies employed in the Talmudic period quite bear out this strong saying (see Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraical,' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-26.htm">Mark 5:26</a>). The physicians of Gilead, however, probably confined themselves to their one famous simple, the balsam. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the health... recovered</span>? Gesenius renders, less probably, "hath no bandage been applied to the daughter of my people?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.</body></html>
