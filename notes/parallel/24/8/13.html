<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm" title="And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the middle of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.">Isaiah 5:2</a>. Israel is a degenerate vine, a barren fig-tree. Here, again, we find an echo of the teaching of Jeremiah in that of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-19.htm" title="And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/13-6.htm" title="He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.">Luke 13:6-9</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-1.htm" title="Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the first ripe fruit.">Micah 7:1</a> we have another example of the same figurative language.<p><span class= "bld">The things that I have given them . . .</span>--The words have been differently rendered, (1) <span class= "ital">I gave them that which they transgress</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the divine law of righteousness; and (2) <span class= "ital">therefore I will appoint those that shall pass over them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the invaders who shall overrun their country. The former seems on the whole best suited to the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>. - Further description of the judgment; grief of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be no grapes</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">there are no grapes</span>... <span class="accented">and the leaf is faded</span>. It is the actual condition of things which the prophet describes. Elsewhere Judah is compared to a vine with bad grapes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>); here the vine does not even pretend to bear fruit. Another figure is that of a barren fig tree (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the things that I have given them</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and I gave them that which they transgress</span> (viz. <span class="accented">laws</span>). The construction, however, which this rendering implies is not perfectly natural, though supported by most of the ancient versions (except the Septuagint, which omits the words), and it is better to alter a single vowel-point, and render "And I will give them to those who shall pass over them." The phrase to pass away is constantly used of an invading host; e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10, 40</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-13 What brought this ruin? 1. The people would not attend to reason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, ver. 7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well. Selfish teachers may promise peace when there is no peace; and thus men encourage each other in committing evil; but in the day of visitation they will have no refuge to flee unto.</body></html>
