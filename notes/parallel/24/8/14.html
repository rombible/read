They are ready to flee into the defenced cities, as the prophet had told them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm" title="Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow you the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defended cities.">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, but it is without hope. They are going into the silence as of death, for to that silence Jehovah himself has brought them.<p><span class= "bld">Water of gall.</span>--The idea implied is that of poison as well as bitterness. It is uncertain what the "gall-plant" was; possibly, from its connection with "grapes" or "clusters," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm" title="For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>, belladonna or colocynth is meant. Others have suggested the poppy, and this is in part confirmed by the narcotic properties implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm" title="They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.">Matthew 27:34</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a> it is joined with "wormwood."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why do we sit still?</span> The prophet transports us by a stroke of his pen into the midst of the fulfillment of his prophecy. The people of the country districts are represented as urging each other to flight. True, it is the resource of despair. <span class="cmt_word">No defensed cities</span> can defend them against the judgment of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">Let us be silent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let us perish</span>; literally, <span class="accented">let us be put to silence</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hath put us to silence</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hath caused us to perish</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. hath decreed our destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Water of gall</span>; a phrase characteristic of our prophet (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>). It is a little difficult to find a rendering which shall suit all the passages in which <span class="accented">rosh</span> (gall) is mentioned. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a> (and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>) it is clearly used for "venom" in general; and yet in Ver. 32 of the same chapter it obviously means a plant. Another general application of the term seems to have been to bitterness in general, the ideas of bitterness and poisonousness being taken as interchangeable. The Authorized Version may therefore stand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.</body></html>
