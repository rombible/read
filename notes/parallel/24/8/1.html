Not even the dead should sleep in peace. With an awful re-iteration of the word, so as to give the emphasis as of the toll of a funeral bell, the prophet heaps clause upon clause, "the <span class= "ital">bones </span>of the kings," "the <span class= "ital">bones </span>of the princes," and so on. The motives of this desecration of the sepulchres might be either the wanton ferocity of barbarian conquerors, bent, after the manner of savage warfare, on the mutilation of the dead, or the greed of gain and the expectation of finding concealed treasures. So Hyrcanus, to the great scandal of the Jews, broke open the sepulchre of David (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant. </span>vii. 15).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - Punishment will even overtake the sinners who have long since been deceased. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall bring out the bones</span>. Not only shall many of the dead bodies remain unburied, but the sepulchers of those who have till now "lain in honor, each one in his house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18</a>), shall be violated. <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Jerusalem</span> meant are evidently those of the upper class, for the others were buried, with but little regard to the security of the corpses, in the valley of Kedron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>). According to some, the motive of this invasion of the chambers of the dead is avarice (comp. Herod., 1:187, Darius at the tomb of Nitocris); but the context, without excluding this view, rather suggests malice and contempt. Thus "the wrath of man" was to "praise" Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-3 Though no real hurt can be done to a dead body, yet disgrace to the remains of wicked persons may alarm those yet alive; and this reminds us that the Divine justice and punishments extend beyond the grave. Whatever befalls us here, let us humble ourselves before God, and seek his mercy.</body></html>
