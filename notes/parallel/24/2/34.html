The fact which follows is adduced as the crowning evidence of wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Blood of the souls</span> is explained by the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "The soul of the flesh [i.e. of the body] is in the blood;" hence the importance of the blood in the Mosaic sacrifices. The historical reference of this passage of Jeremiah may well be to the persecution of Manasseh, who is said to have "shed innocent blood very much" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). It is Judah, no doubt, who is addressed, but the prophets mostly assume the "solidarity" of king and people (analogous to that of a forefather and his posterity); Manasseh, moreover, probably had the support of a large section of the population, at any rate in so far as he favored the inveterate cultus of the high places or local sanctuaries. <span class="cmt_word">I have not found it by secret search</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast not found them breaking through</span> (<span class="accented">houses</span>). The phraseology agrees with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>, the law against "breaking through;" it suggests that the houses of all but the highest class in ancient as well as often in modern Palestine, were made of mere sun-dried brick, which could be easily "dug into" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>, in the Greek). [Lieut. Conder states, it is true, that in hilly districts of Palestine the houses of the villages are built of stone, but he adds that the stone is simply taken from the ruins of the ancient towns.] Burglars caught in the act might be killed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>), but the innocent victims of persecution could not be brought under this category, and hence those who slew them were really guilty of murder. <span class="cmt_word">But upon all these</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but because of all these things</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not for any crime, but because of thine things," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a>); so Hitzig, Keil Payne Smith; less naturally De Dieu, "because of those false gods" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:29-37 The nation had not been wrought upon by the judgements of God, but sought to justify themselves. The world is, to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness; but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasant places. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it. They may shift from one sin to another, but none ever hardened himself against God, or turned from him, and prospered.</body></html>
