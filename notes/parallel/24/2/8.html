The salt had lost its savour. The light had become darkness. The rebuke, we must remember, came from the lips of one who was himself a priest.<p><span class= "bld">The priests said not, Where is the Lord?</span>--The same failure to seek as that condemned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>. To them, too, all was a routine. Jehovah was absent from their thoughts even in the very act of worship.<p><span class= "bld">They that</span> <span class= "bld">handle the law.</span>--These, probably, were also of the priestly order, to whom this function was assigned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm" title="They shall teach Jacob your judgments, and Israel your law: they shall put incense before you, and whole burnt sacrifice on your altar.">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>. The order of non-priestly scribes, in the sense of interpreters of the law, does not appear till after the captivity. Their sin was that they "dealt with the law" as interpreters and judges, and forgot Jehovah who had given it.<p><span class= "bld">The pastors.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">shepherds, </span>the English "pastors" having gained a too definitely religious connotation. The Hebrew word was general in its significance, but in its Old Testament use was applied chiefly to civil rulers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm" title="From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.">Psalm 78:71</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm" title="And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.">1Kings 22:17</a>. Even in Ezekiel 34, where the spiritual aspect of rule is most prominent, the contrast between the false shepherds and the one true shepherd of the house of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-23.htm" title="How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;">Jeremiah 2:23</a>) shows that the kingly, not the priestly, office was in the prophet's mind.<p><span class= "bld">The prophets prophesied by Baal.</span>--The precise form of the sin described was probably connected with the oracular power ascribed to Baal-zebub, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2Kings 1:2</a>. The evil was of long standing. It was one of the sins of the people in Isaiah's time that they were "soothsayers like the Philistines" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>). When Ahab first introduced the Ph?nician worship, it was by the prophets rather than the priests of Baal that the new <span class= "ital">cultus </span>was propagated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm" title="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.">1Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm" title="Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.">1Kings 22:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Things that do not profit.</span>--The word had acquired an almost proverbial force as applied to idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm" title="And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.">1Samuel 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9</a>). So the phrase is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm" title="Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.">Jeremiah 2:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priests</span>, etc. The blame principally falls on the three leading classes (as in ver. 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>). First on the priests who "handle the <span class="accented">Law</span>," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who have a traditional knowledge of the details of the Law, and teach the people accordingly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; see also on Jeremiah 8:8); next on the "pastors," or "shepherds" (in the Homeric sense), the civil and not the spiritual authorities; so generally in the Old Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5, 8, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>); and lastly on the prophets, who sought their inspiration, not from Jehovah (comp. note on ver. 30), but from Baal. <span class="cmt_word">To prophesy by</span> (by means of) <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span> or rather, <span class="accented">the Baal</span>, implies that prophecy is due to an impulse from the supernatural world; that it is not an objectifying of the imaginations of the prophet himself. Even the Baal prophets yielded to an impulse from without, but how that impulse was produced the prophet does not tell us. We are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>, that even prophets of Jehovah could be led astray by a "lying spirit;" much more presumably could prophets of the Baal. <span class="accented">The Baal is</span> here used as a representative of the idol-gods, in antithesis to Jehovah; sometimes "Baalim," or the Baals, is used instead (e.g. ver. 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13</a>), each town or city having its own Baal ("lord"). <span class="cmt_word">Things that do not profit</span>. A synonym for idols (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm">1 Samuel 12:21</a>). An enlightened regard for self-interest is encouraged by the religion of the Bible, at any rate educationally. Contrast Comtism. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who begin well, but do not persevere, will justly be upbraided with their hopeful and promising beginnings. Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeared devoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate their crimes! Let us be careful that we do not lose in zeal and fervency, as we gain knowledge.</body></html>
