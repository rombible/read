It was implied in the "jealous God" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>, illustrated by an actual history, which was also a parable, in Hosea 1-3, and after its use by Jeremiah, expanded more fully by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16). The "espousals" are thought of as coinciding with the great covenant of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>, when the people solemnly entered into the relation to which God called them. Then the bride was ready to follow her lord and husband even in an "unsown land"--the "waste howling wilderness" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm" title="He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>. The faithfulness of the past is contrasted with the unfaithfulness of the present.<p><span class= "bld">When thou wentest after me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">thy going after me.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the cars of Jerusalem</span>. Presumably Jeremiah had received his call at Anathoth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I remember thee</span>, etc.; rather, 1 <span class="accented">remember for thy good the kindness of thy youth</span>. It is an open question whether the "kindness" spoken of is that of God towards the people, or of the people towards God. The usage of the Hebrew (<span class="accented">khesed</span>) admits of either acceptation; comp. for the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>, 36:5, and many other passages; for the second, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4, 6</a> (in ver. 6 rendering for "mercy," "goodness") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a> (rendering "men of piety"). But the context, which dwells so strongly on the oblivion into which the Divine benefits had been allowed to pass, is decidedly in favor of the first view. How beautiful is this condescending language! Jehovah's past feelings come Back to him; at least, so it appears to the believer, when God lets the light of his countenance shine forth again (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). He even condescends to overlook the weakness and inconsistency of the Israel of antiquity. He idealizes it (i.e. Jeremiah is permitted to do so). This is in harmony with other prophetic passages (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a> ("as at the first"); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6-14</a>). The figure of the bride recurs constantly (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thine espousals</span>; rather, thy <span class="accented">bridal</span> state. <span class="cmt_word">When thou wentest after</span> me (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>, "all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who begin well, but do not persevere, will justly be upbraided with their hopeful and promising beginnings. Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeared devoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate their crimes! Let us be careful that we do not lose in zeal and fervency, as we gain knowledge.</body></html>
