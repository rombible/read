The prophet was taught that Israel, as a nation, had a priestly character, and was consecrated to the Lord as the "firstfruits" of the great harvest of the world. Compare the use of the same figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm" title="For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.">Romans 11:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">All that devour him shall </span>offend.--The imagery of the firstfruits is continued. The Hebrew for the word "offend" is used for transgressions against the ceremonial law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-5.htm" title="And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he has sinned in that thing:">Leviticus 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-19.htm" title="It is a trespass offering: he has certainly trespassed against the LORD.">Leviticus 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-7.htm" title="Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.">Numbers 5:7</a>. Here, however, it is probably better rendered, <span class= "ital">shall be condemned, </span>or <span class= "ital">shall be made to suffer, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/34-21.htm" title="Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.">Psalm 34:21-22</a>, where the Authorised version has "shall be desolate." Those who devour Israel--the enemies and invaders, the tyrants and oppressors--are guilty as of a sacrilege that will not remain unpunished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel was holiness</span>, etc. Israel was a consecrated people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>). Isaiah, fond as he is of the phrase "Israel's Holy <span class="accented">One</span>," does not expressly enforce the correlative truth, as Jeremiah does here. <span class="cmt_word">The first-fruits of his increase</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his firstfruits</span> of increase. Israel is compared to the firstfruits (<span class="accented">reshith</span>) of the land, which were devoted to the house of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12, 13</a>). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>, the title given him is "the chief [margin, 'firstfruits'] of the nations" (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a>, a synonymous and cognate word, <span class="accented">rosh</span>, takes the place of <span class="accented">reshith</span> for "chief"). <span class="cmt_word">All that devour him shall offend</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all that ate him incurred guilt</span>, or became guilty of a trespass. Foreigners were forbidden to eat of consecrated things; by breaking this law they became guilty of a "trespass," having invaded the rights of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10, 15, 16</a>). The word for "trespass" is the same as that rendered "guilt." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who begin well, but do not persevere, will justly be upbraided with their hopeful and promising beginnings. Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeared devoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate their crimes! Let us be careful that we do not lose in zeal and fervency, as we gain knowledge.</body></html>
