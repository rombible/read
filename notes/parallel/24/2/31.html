Has He been to them as a waste land, a land of thick darkness (literally, according to one interpretation, <span class= "ital">darkness of Jah, </span>in the sense of intensity), that they are thus unmindful of Him? So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-6.htm" title="Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame.">Song of Solomon 8:6</a> we have "flame of Jah," as representing the Hebrew, in the margin, and "very vehement flame" in the text, of the Authorised version.<p><span class= "bld">We are lords.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">We rove at will, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm" title="And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.">Genesis 27:40</a>, where, however, the Authorised version gives "when thou shalt have the dominion." The sense is practically the same. Israel claims the power to do as she likes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O generation, see ye</span>. It is doubtful whether <span class="accented">generation</span> here means "contemporaries" (equivalent to "men of this generation"), or, like <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;</span> sometimes in the New Testament, a class of men united by moral affinity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>). In the latter case we should rather attach the pronoun in "see ye" <span class="accented">to</span> "O generation," and render "O (evil) generation that ye are!" So Hitzig, Keil, and Payne Smith; Ewald and Delitzsch adopt the first rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Have I been a wilderness</span>, etc.? "Have I not been the source of light and happiness to my people, and of all temporal blessings?" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). So the Divine speaker in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>, "I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain," or more literally, "in chaos" (same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>); "chaos" and "the wilderness" are both images of that which is utterly unremunerative. <span class="cmt_word">A land of darkness</span>. This is, of course, not literally accurate as a description of the Arabian desert. "Darkness" is here used as a synonym for "misery." Cloud and rain occupy precisely opposite places in the estimation of nomadic and agricultural peoples respectively. "The Bedouins," says an Arabic scholast, "always follow the rain and the places where raindrops fall;" whereas a townsman of Mecca calls himself "child of the sun." So Indra and Varuna, originally belonging to the cloudy and rainy sky, are in the Vedic hymns endowed with solar traits. It should be added here that it is an old problem, and too difficult a one for us to investigate, whether we should render "the darkness of Jah" (Jehovah) or (as Authorized Version) simply "darkness." The former rendering will mean very great darkness, such as Jehovah sends in judgment (e.g. to the Egyptians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). On this question, see Dr. Ginsburg on <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a> (where a similar doubt exists), Geiger's 'Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel,' p. 276; Ewald, 'Lehrbuch der Hebraischen Sprache,' &sect; 270 e. <span class="cmt_word">We are lords</span>; rather, <span class="accented">we have broken loose</span>. It is, however, a difficult word, which only occurs elsewhere in Genesis 26:40; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:29-37 The nation had not been wrought upon by the judgements of God, but sought to justify themselves. The world is, to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness; but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasant places. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it. They may shift from one sin to another, but none ever hardened himself against God, or turned from him, and prospered.</body></html>
