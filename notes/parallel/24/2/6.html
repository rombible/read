he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>, the horrors of the wilderness are painted in vivid colours, to heighten the contrast with the land into which they had been brought. The picture was true of part, but not of the whole, of the region of the wanderings. But the people had forgotten this. There was no seeking for the Lord who had then been so gracious. The question, Where is He? never crossed their thoughts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither said they,</span> etc.; as their children's children were forced by stress of trouble to say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>; see note). <span class="cmt_word">A land of desserts and of pits.</span> The first phrase applied to the region through which the Israelites passed ("a wilderness") was vague, and might mean merely pasture-land. The remainder of the description, however, shows that "wilderness" is here meant, as often (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>), in the sense of "desert." Though recent travelers have shown that the Sinaitie peninsula is not by any means universally a "desert," and that in ancient times it was still less so, it is not unnatural that an agricultural people should regard it as a most inhospitable region, and should even idealize its terrors (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>). "Pits," i.e. rents and fissures in the soil, in which the unwary traveler might lose his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Jeremiah 18:20, 22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who begin well, but do not persevere, will justly be upbraided with their hopeful and promising beginnings. Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeared devoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate their crimes! Let us be careful that we do not lose in zeal and fervency, as we gain knowledge.</body></html>
