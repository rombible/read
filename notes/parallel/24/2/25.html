Here he has Hosea as giving a prototype (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm" title="For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.">Hosea 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm" title="And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.">Hosea 2:7</a>), perhaps also Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/23-15.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.">Isaiah 23:15-16</a>). The picture may probably enough have been drawn from the life, but that sketched in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/7-10.htm" title="And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtle of heart.">Proverbs 7:10-23</a> may well have supplied the outline. Jehovah, as her true husband, bids the apostate wife to refrain for very shame from acting as the harlot, rushing barefoot into the streets, panting, as with a thirst that craves to be quenched, for the gratification of her desires. The "unshod" may possibly refer to one feature of the worship of Baal or Ashtaroth, men and women taking off their shoes when they entered into their temples, as being holy ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm" title="And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.">Exodus 3:5</a>), and joining in orgiastic dances.<p><span class= "bld">Thou saidst, There is no hope: no.</span>--Here also we find a parallel to the thought and language of Hosea. There the one effectual remedy for the evil into which the apostate wife had fallen was to speak to her heart, and to open the door of hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.">Hosea 2:14-15</a>). Now the malignity of the evil is shown by the loss of all hope of recovery in returning to Jehovah:--<p>"Small sins the heart first desecrate,<p>At last despair persuades to great."<p>Like Gomer, she will go after her "lovers," though they are "strangers," as if they were her only protectors. It would seem, from the recurrence of the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm" title="And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.">Jeremiah 18:12</a>, as if it were the formula of a despairing fatalism, like the proverb of the fathers eating sour grapes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-29.htm" title="In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.">Jeremiah 31:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm" title="What mean you, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?">Ezekiel 18:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withhold thy foot</span>, etc. Hitzig, with unnecessary ingenuity, explains this with reference to the fatiguing practices of the heathen cultus, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>, where "vain repetitions" of "Baal, Baal," and (as he thinks) barefoot religious dances, are mentioned as parts of the worship of Baal. Umbreit's view, however, is far more natural. "God the true husband exhorts Israel not to run barefoot, and with parched throat, like a shameless adulteress, after strangers" (Payne Smith). There is no hops; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the exhortation is in vain (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm">Jeremiah 18:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:20-28 Notwithstanding all their advantages, Israel had become like the wild vine that bears poisonous fruit. Men are often as much under the power of their unbridled desires and their sinful lusts, as the brute beasts. But the Lord here warns them not to weary themselves in pursuits which could only bring distress and misery. As we must not despair of the mercy of God, but believe that to be sufficient for the pardon of our sins, so neither must we despair of the grace of God, but believe that it is able to subdue our corruptions, though ever so strong.</body></html>
