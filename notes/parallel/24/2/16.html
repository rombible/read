The words indicate that the prophet set himself from the first, as Isaiah had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>), against the policy of an Egyptian alliance. The LXX. translators, following, we must believe, an Egyptian tradition, identify the Hebrew Noph with Memphis in northern Egypt; later critics, with Napata in the south. Its conjunction with Tahapanes, the Daphnae of the Greeks, which was on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, and on the frontier, seems in favour of the former view.<p><span class= "bld">Have broken.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">shall feed on, lay waste, depasture, </span>so as to produce baldness. Baldness among the Jews, as with other -Eastern nations, was a shame and reproach (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.">Isaiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm" title="He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm" title="And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:">Isaiah 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm" title="And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.">2Kings 2:23</a>), and was therefore a natural symbol of the ignominy and ruin of a people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also the children of Noph</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. This is the climax of the calamity. Noph, called Moph in the Hebrew text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>, is generally identified with Memphis (after the Septuagint), which was called in the inscriptions Mennufr, or "the good abode," but may possibly be Napata, the Nap of the inscriptions, the residency of the Ethiopian dynasty (De Rouge'). <span class="cmt_word">Tahapanes</span>. The Hebrew form is <span class="accented">Takhpanes</span> or <span class="accented">Tahhpanhhes</span>. This was a fortified frontier town on the Pelusiot arm of the Nile, called in Greek Daphnae (Herod., 2:20), or Taphnae (Septuagint here). <span class="cmt_word">Have broken,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">shall break</span>, or (for the pointing in the Hebrew Bible requires this change) <span class="accented">shall feed off</span> (or <span class="accented">depasture</span>). From this verse onwards, Judah is personified as a woman, as appears from the suffixes in the Hebrew. Baldness was a great mark of disgrace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>). There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>, where, in punishment of the negotiations of Ahaz with Assyria, the prophet threatens an invasion of Judah both by Assyria and by Egypt: and employs the very. same figure (see ver. 20). So here, the devastation threatened by Jeremiah is the punishment of the unhallowed coquetting with the Egyptian power of which the Jewish rulers had been recently guilty. The fact which corresponds to this prediction is the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo, and the consequent subjugation of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). The abruptness with which ver. 16 follows upon ver. 15 suggests that some words have fallen out of the text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-19 Is Israel a servant? No, they are the seed of Abraham. We may apply this spiritually: Is the soul of man a slave? No, it is not; but has sold its own liberty, and enslaved itself to divers lusts and passions. The Assyrian princes, like lions, prevailed against Israel. People from Egypt destroyed their glory and strength. They brought these calamities on themselves by departing from the Lord. The use and application of this is, Repent of thy sin, that thy correction may not be thy ruin. What has a Christian to do in the ways of forbidden pleasure or vain sinful mirth, or with the pursuits of covetousness and ambition?</body></html>
