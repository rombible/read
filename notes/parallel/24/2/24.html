The "occasion" and the "month<span class= "ital">" </span>are, of course, the season when the stimulus of animal desire is strongest. There is no need for the stallion to seek her with a weary search, she presents herself and pursues him. So there was in Israel what we should describe as a mania for the hateful worship of the heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wild ass</span>, etc. The type of wildness and independence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That snuffeth up the wind</span>; to cool the heat of her passion. <span class="cmt_word">In her occasion... in her month</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. at the pairing-time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:20-28 Notwithstanding all their advantages, Israel had become like the wild vine that bears poisonous fruit.

As we must not despair of the mercy of God, but believe that to be sufficient for the pardon of our sins, so neither must we despair of the grace of God, but believe that it is able to subdue our corruptions, though ever so strong.</body></html>
