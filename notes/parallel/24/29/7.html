To refrain from all curses and imprecations, even from such as came from the lips of those who hung their harps on the willows by the waters of Babylon (Psalms 137), to pray for the peace and prosperity of the city where they were eating the bread of captivity--this surely required an almost superhuman patience. Yet this was the prophet's counsel. It seems almost to follow--unless we apply Augustine's rule, <span class= "ital">Distingue tempora, </span>and refer the psalm to a time prior <span class= "ital">to </span>Jeremiah's letter, or nearer the day of vengeance--that those imprecations, natural as they seem, belonged to a lower stage of spiritual progress than that represented by the prophet. He was, to those impatient exiles, as our Lord was to the impatient disciples who sought to call down fire on the village of the Samaritans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-54.htm" title="And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?">Luke 9:54-56</a>). So, we may remember, Christians living under Nero were told to pray for the Emperor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.">1Timothy 2:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seek the peace of the city</span>, etc. Interest yourselves in the "<span class="accented">peace"</span> or welfare of the city, whether Babylon or any other place where ye may be in exile, and pray for its welfare, for your own well-being is inseparable from it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-7 The written word of God is as truly given by inspiration of God as his spoken word. The zealous servant of the Lord will use every means to profit those who are far off, as well as those who are near him. The art of writing is very profitable for this end; and by the art of printing it is rendered most beneficial for circulating the knowledge of the word of God. God's sending to the captives by this letter would show that he had not forsaken them, though he was displeased, and corrected them. If they live in the fear of God, they may live comfortably in Babylon. In all conditions of life, it is our wisdom and duty not to throw away the comfort of what we may have, because we have not all we would have. They are directed to seek the good of the country where they were captives. While the king of Babylon protected them, they must live quiet and peaceable lives under him, in all godliness and honesty; patiently leaving it to God to work deliverance for them in due time.</body></html>
