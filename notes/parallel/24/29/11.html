In the "thoughts" of God there is, perhaps, a reference to what had been said before of the Babylonian exiles in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm" title="For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.">Jeremiah 24:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To give you an expected end.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to give you a future </span>(that which is to be hereafter) <span class= "ital">and a hope. </span>This is the literal rendering of the words, and it is far more expressive than that of the English version. An "expected end" may be one from which we shrink in fear or dislike. Each word, in the amended translation, has its full meaning. The "future" tells them that their history as a people is not yet over; the "hope" that there is a better time in store for them. To wait for that future, instead of trusting in delusive assurances of immediate release, was the true wisdom of the exiles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I knew the thoughts</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though seventy years must pass over you in exile, yet do not apprehend that I have forgotten you, for I know full well what my purpose is towards you - a purpose of restoring to you "peace" and prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">An expected end</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a future and a</span> hope; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hopeful future (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-17.htm">Jeremiah 31:17</a>, "There is a hope for thy future"). That unexpectant apathy which is the terrible accompaniment of so much worldly sorrow was not to be an ingredient in the lot of the Jews. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:8-19 Let men beware how they call those prophets whom they choose after their own fancies, and how they consider their fancies and dreams to be revelations from God. False prophets flatter people in their sins, because they love to be flattered; and they speak smoothly to their prophets, that their prophets may speak smoothly to them. God promises that they should return after seventy years were accomplished. By this it appears, that the seventy years of the captivity are not to be reckoned from the last captivity, but the first. It will be the bringing to pass of God's good word to them. This shall form God's purposes. We often do not know our own minds, but the Lord is never at an uncertainty. We are sometimes ready to fear that God's designs are all against us; but as to his own people, even that which seems evil, is for good. He will give them, not the expectations of their fears, or the expectations of their fancies, but the expectations of their faith; the end he has promised, which will be the best for them. When the Lord pours out an especial spirit of prayer, it is a good sign that he is coming toward us in mercy. Promises are given to quicken and encourage prayer. He never said, Seek ye me in vain. Those who remained at Jerusalem would be utterly destroyed, notwithstanding what the false prophets said to the contrary. The reason has often been given, and it justifies the eternal ruin of impenitent sinners; Because they have not hearkened to my words; I called, but they refused.</body></html>
