They would seem to have been the leaders of the party of revolt, and to have been conspicuous, like their brethren at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm" title="I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.">Jeremiah 23:14</a>), for base and profligate lives. The record of the prediction of their fate implies its fulfilment. They were punished by the Chaldaean king as traitors and rebels, and were burnt alive. The history of the "three children" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-6.htm" title="And whoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.">Daniel 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-20.htm" title="And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.">Daniel 3:20</a>, shows that this was a sufficiently familiar punishment. A strange legend in the Targum of Rabbi Joseph on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2Chronicles 28:3</a> records that the future high-priest Joshua, the son of Jozedek, was thrown into the furnace with them, and came out uninjured (Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict, of the Bible, </span>Art. "Zedekiah"). We may, perhaps, trace the source of the legend in the figurative language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>, "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?" The name Kolaiah (which admits of being derived from a verb meaning "roasting") possibly suggested the cruel mockery of a punishment which turned it into an omen of the false prophet's fate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span>. The name is into-resting; it shows that this prophet belonged to a family which took pleasure in the thought of Jehovah and his righteousness. Doubtless, too, he did so himself; but he under-estimated the demands of that righteousness, which extended to the heart as well as to the outward conduct. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:20-32 Jeremiah foretells judgments upon the false prophets, who deceived the Jews in Babylon. Lying was bad; lying to the people of the Lord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending to rest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. They flattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God; and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hidden works of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief by having power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in their distress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God works with them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefit of God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many active Christians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that they earnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, and to wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.</body></html>
