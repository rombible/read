There, too, "prophets and diviners," whom the Lord had not sent, were prophesying of a speedy deliverance, and it was necessary to reiterate for those who would listen to the prophet's warnings, that the exile would run its appointed course of seventy years, as Jeremiah had announced to the people of Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, said the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-22.htm" title="They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, said the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.">Jeremiah 27:22</a>.

It had not only its "princes" and its "elders," but its "prophets" and its "diviners," who encouraged the same false hopes as those in Judah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-9.htm">Jeremiah 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-2.htm">Jeremiah 28:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Your dreams which ye caused to be dreamed</span>; or, <span class="accented">which ye cause yourselves to dream</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-9.htm">Jeremiah 27:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:8-19 Let men beware how they call those prophets whom they choose after their own fancies, and how they consider their fancies and dreams to be revelations from God. False prophets flatter people in their sins, because they love to be flattered; and they speak smoothly to their prophets, that their prophets may speak smoothly to them. God promises that they should return after seventy years were accomplished. By this it appears, that the seventy years of the captivity are not to be reckoned from the last captivity, but the first. It will be the bringing to pass of God's good word to them. This shall form God's purposes. We often do not know our own minds, but the Lord is never at an uncertainty. We are sometimes ready to fear that God's designs are all against us; but as to his own people, even that which seems evil, is for good. He will give them, not the expectations of their fears, or the expectations of their fancies, but the expectations of their faith; the end he has promised, which will be the best for them. When the Lord pours out an especial spirit of prayer, it is a good sign that he is coming toward us in mercy. Promises are given to quicken and encourage prayer. He never said, Seek ye me in vain. Those who remained at Jerusalem would be utterly destroyed, notwithstanding what the false prophets said to the contrary. The reason has often been given, and it justifies the eternal ruin of impenitent sinners; Because they have not hearkened to my words; I called, but they refused.</body></html>
