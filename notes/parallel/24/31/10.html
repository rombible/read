<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm" title="Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm" title="Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name.">Isaiah 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm" title="And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.">Isaiah 66:19</a>, as the vague representative of the distant lands of the west--sometimes (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-24.htm" title="And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.">Numbers 24:24</a>;

Of the isles so referred to, Cyprus and Crete, so far as any definite localities were thought of, would probably be most conspicuous. Both the "nations" and the "isles" represent the heathen whom the prophet calls to join in the praises offered by Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The isles;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the distant countries of the West (see on Jeremiah 2:10). So great an event as the restoration of the chosen people would be of worldwide importance. <span class="cmt_word">He that scattered Israel will gather him,</span> etc. "The Israelites were the flock of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>), but during the Captivity a scattered and miserable flock. Jeremiah says that his eye 'shall run down with tears, because the flock of Jehovah is carried away captive' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>). The change in the fortunes of the Jews is compared by the prophets to a shepherd's seeking his lost sheep, and feeding them again in green pastures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>). The reference is not so much to the homeward journey of the exiles as to the state of temporal and spiritual happiness in which they would find themselves on their return. The same figures occur in a psalm, where a reference to the return from exile is excluded by the pre-exile date, '... feed them also, and carry them forever' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>)" (from the writer's note on Isaiah 40:11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:10-17 He that scattered Israel, knows where to find them. It is comfortable to observe the goodness of the Lord in the gifts of providence. But our souls are never valuable as gardens, unless watered with the dews of God's Spirit and grace. A precious promise follows, which will not have full accomplishment except in the heavenly Zion. Let them be satisfied of God's loving-kindness, and they will be satisfied with it, and desire no more to make them happy. Rachel is represented as rising from her grave, and refusing to be comforted, supposing her offspring rooted out. The murder of the children at Bethlehem, by Herod, Mt 2:16-18, in some degree fulfilled this prediction, but could not be its full meaning. If we have hope in the end, concerning an eternal inheritance, for ourselves and those belonging to us, all temporal afflictions may be borne, and will be for our good.</body></html>
