With Jeremiah, however, as before with Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17-25</a>), and on a much larger scale with Ezekiel (Ezekiel 40-48), this was the natural outgrowth of the vividness with which the restored city came before his mental vision. He saw a goodly city rise as from the ruins of the old, truly and not in name only consecrated to Jehovah, and describes, as best he can, how it differed from them. The tower of Hananeel appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm" title="Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel.">Nehemiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm" title="And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.">Nehemiah 12:39</a>, to have been identical, or connected, with the tower of Meah, and to have been between the fish-gate and the sheep-gate, at the north-east corner of the city walls. It is named again, as one of the conspicuous landmarks of the city, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>. The "corner-gate" at the north-west corner, and near the present Jaffa-gate, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm" title="Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.">2Chronicles 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-24.htm" title="After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, even to the corner.">Nehemiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-32.htm" title="And between the going up of the corner to the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.">Nehemiah 3:32</a>. The wall in this quarter had apparently been battered during the siege of Jerusalem, and the prophet naturally sees the rebuilding of the wall as among the first-fruits of the restoration.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-40.</span> - The connection is not very clear. The main point of these verses is that Jerusalem, when rebuilt, shall be altogether "the Lord's." Its circumference shall even be extended with the single object of including spots at present unclean, but then to become holy like the rest of the city. According to Hengstenberg and Keil, Jerusalem is here a figure of the kingdom of God in the latter days. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Hananeel.</span> This lay at the northeast corner of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The gate of the corner</span>. At the north, west corner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>). Both this and the tower of Hananeel are mentioned together again in the prophecy of the glorification of Jerusalem, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:35-40 As surely as the heavenly bodies will continue their settled course, according to the will of their Creator, to the end of time, and as the raging sea obeys him, so surely will the Jews be continued a separate people. Words can scarcely set forth more strongly the restoration of Israel. The rebuilding of Jerusalem, and its enlargement and establishment, shall be an earnest of the great things God will do for the gospel church. The personal happiness of every true believer, as well as the future restoration of Israel, is secured by promise, covenant, and oath. This Divine love passes knowledge; and to those who take hold upon it, every present mercy is an earnest of salvation.</body></html>
