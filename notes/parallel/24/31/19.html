but the repetition of the word that had been used in the previous verse makes it far more natural to connect it with the first movement of repentance. The "smiting upon the thigh" is, like the Publican's "smiting on his breast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>), an Eastern expression of extremest grief. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-17.htm" title="I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.">Ezekiel 21:17</a> we have the "smiting of the hands together" as a symbol of anger, which is also sorrow. In Homer (<span class= "ital">Odyss. </span>xiii. 193) we have the very gesture here depicted--<p>"And then he groaned, and smote on both his thighs<p>With headlong hands, and so in sorrow spoke."<p><span class= "bld">The reproach of my youth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the shame which the sins of his youth had brought upon him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After that I was turned, I repented;</span> rather, <span class="accented">after my turning away</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a>), I have <span class="accented">repented.</span> It is a different kind of "turning" which is here meant, a turning away from God. <span class="cmt_word">I was instructed;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I was made to know</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> brought to my senses by punishment. <span class="cmt_word">I smote upon my thigh;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I have smitten</span>, etc. Ephraim describes his present state of mind, and the symbols by which he translates it into act. Smiting upon the thigh was a sign of mourning (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-17.htm">Ezekiel 21:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I did bear,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">I have borne</span>, etc. The "reproach of Ephraim's youth" is that which he brought upon himself in early times by his unfaithfulness to Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:18-20 Ephraim (the ten tribes) is weeping for sin. He is angry at himself for his sin, and folly, and frowardness. He finds he cannot, by his own power, keep himself close with God, much less bring himself back when he is revolted. Therefore he prays, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned. His will was bowed to the will of God. When the teaching of God's Spirit went with the corrections of his providence, then the work was done. This is our comfort in affliction, that the Lord thinks upon us. God has mercy in store, rich mercy, sure mercy, suitable mercy, for all who seek him in sincerity.</body></html>
