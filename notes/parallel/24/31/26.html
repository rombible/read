By some writers (Rosenmller) they have been referred to Jehovah under the figure of the husband who has dreamt of his wife's return. Others (Ewald) have seen in them a quotation from some well-known psalm or hymn, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm" title="As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness.">Psalm 17:15</a>, indicating that in the golden days to which Jeremiah looked forward there should be freedom even from the evil and dark dreams of a time of peril, so that every man should be able to give thanks for the "sweet" gift of sleep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm" title="It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he gives his beloved sleep.">Psalm 127:2</a>). It is, however, far more natural to take them as the prophet's own words. The vision of a restored Israel, such as he paints it in the preceding verses, had come to him in his sleep. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-28.htm" title="The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>, as to this mode of revelation.) And when he woke up there was no sense of bitter disappointment like that of the dreamer described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm" title="It shall even be as when an hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats; but he wakes, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks; but he wakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.">Isaiah 29:8</a>. The promise that came to him when he woke was as distinct and blessed as the dream had been. The "sweet sleep" has its parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-24.htm" title="When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yes, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.">Proverbs 3:24</a>.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon this I awaked,</span> etc. Who the speaker is here has been much debated. That Jehovah is meant is not an admissible view. A weak believer may say complainingly, "Why sleepest thou?" but God himself cannot be represented under the image of a sleeper. There seems, however, to be no reason why the prophet should not have used this language. The doubt is whether a real, physical sleep is meant, or merely an ecstatic condition resembling sleep. Hengstenberg decides for the latter. But there is no parallel for sleep in the sense of ecstasy, and, on the other hand, there is evidence enough for dreams as the channels of Divine revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-2.htm">1 Kings 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). As Naegelsbach points out, this is the only unqualifiedly comforting prophecy in the whole book, and may well have left a sweet savour in the prophet's memory. Stern, indeed, was the reality which the moment of his waking brought back to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:21-26 The way from the bondage of sin to the liberty of God's children, is a high-way. It is plain, it is safe; yet none are likely to walk in it, unless they set their hearts towards it. They are encouraged by the promise of a new, unheard-of, extraordinary thing; a creation, a work of Almighty power; the human nature of Christ, formed and prepared by the power of the Holy Ghost: and this is here mentioned as an encouragement to the Jews to return to their own land. And a comfortable prospect is given them of a happy settlement there. Godliness and honesty God has joined: let no man think to put them asunder, or to make the one atone for the want of the other. In the love and favour of God the weary soul shall find rest, and the sorrowful shall find joy. And what can we see with more satisfaction than the good of Jerusalem, and peace upon Israel?</body></html>
