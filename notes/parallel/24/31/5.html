In the Hebrew words "shall eat them as common things" we have a singular train of associations. The primary meaning of the verb is to "profane." The rule of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23-24</a>, based partly, perhaps, on grounds of culture, partly with a symbolic meaning, required that a vineyard for three years after it was planted should be treated as "uncircumcised" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that no use should be made of the fruit), in the fourth year the fruit was to "be holy to praise the Lord with," and in the fifth the planter might take the fruit for himself. So accordingly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm" title="And what man is he that has planted a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.">Deuteronomy 20:6</a> we have, as one of the laws affecting war, that if a man had planted a vineyard and had not made it common--the same word as that used here--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>had not got beyond the fixed period of consecration, he might be exempted from military service, lest he should die and another eat of it. Compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm" title="You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build an house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof.">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where the English "gather" answers, as the marginal reading shows, to the same verb. What is meant here, therefore, is, in contrast with the chances and changes of a time of war, that the planters of the vineyard should not be disturbed in their possession of it. They should not plant, and another eat thereof. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-22.htm" title="They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.">Isaiah 65:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm" title="You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build an house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof.">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mountains of Samaria.</span> "Samaria" is used, equally with Ephraim, for the northern kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Shall eat</span> them <span class="cmt_word">as common things;</span> rather, <span class="accented">shall enjoy the fruit.</span> The word, however, literally means <span class="accented">shall profane them.</span> The more common phrase, "shall eat the fruit," occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-21.htm">Isaiah 65:21</a>, where the same promise is given. The law was that newly planted fruit trees should be left alone for three years; that in the fourth year their fruit should be consecrated to God; and that in the fifth year their fruit might be "profaned," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> devoted to ordinary uses (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 God assures his people that he will again take them into covenant relation to himself. When brought very low, and difficulties appear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the church formerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort from former smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, are interested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, from everlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Those whom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by the influences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for what he has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs and expects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come; for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness of God shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin with more bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of their captivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father, and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that is good for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a future gathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And they figuratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and the plain and safe way in which they are led.</body></html>
