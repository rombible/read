They have been longer under the sharp discipline of suffering. By this time, he thinks, they must have learnt repentance. He hears--or Jehovah, speaking through him. hears--the moaning of remorse; and in that work, thought of as already accomplished, he finds a new ground for his hope for Judah. Ephraim at last owned that he had deserved the chastisement of the yoke that had been laid on him.<p><span class= "bld">As a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke.</span>--The comparison is the nearest approach in the Old Testament to the Greek proverb about "kicking against the pricks" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm" title="And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-11.htm" title="And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loves to tread out the corn; but I passed over on her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.">Hosea 10:11</a> ("Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught "), which may well have been in Jeremiah's thoughts, we have a like comparison under a somewhat different aspect. The cry which is heard from the lips of the penitent, "Turn thou me<span class= "bld"> . . .</span> ," is, as it were, echoed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm" title="And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you to me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.">Jeremiah 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm" title="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm" title="Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:">Jeremiah 3:14</a>, and is reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-21.htm" title="Turn you us to you, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.">Lamentations 5:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - The ground of this hope, viz. that Ephraim will humble himself with deep contrition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a bullock unaccustomed</span> to the yoke; literally, <span class="accented">as an untaught calf</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Turn thou me,</span> etc. Jeremiah has a peculiarly deep view of conversion. Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-20</a>) simply calls upon his hearers to change their course of life; Jeremiah represents penitent Ephraim as beseeching God so to prepare him that he may indeed "turn." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:18-20 Ephraim (the ten tribes) is weeping for sin. He is angry at himself for his sin, and folly, and frowardness. He finds he cannot, by his own power, keep himself close with God, much less bring himself back when he is revolted. Therefore he prays, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned. His will was bowed to the will of God. When the teaching of God's Spirit went with the corrections of his providence, then the work was done. This is our comfort in affliction, that the Lord thinks upon us. God has mercy in store, rich mercy, sure mercy, suitable mercy, for all who seek him in sincerity.</body></html>
