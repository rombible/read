It would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm" title="Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!">Amos 6:1</a> as if this was a title specially claimed by the kingdom of the Ten Tribes. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-24.htm" title="But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.">Leviticus 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-26.htm" title="And you shall be holy to me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that you should be mine.">Leviticus 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm" title="And to make you high above all nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be an holy people to the LORD your God, as he has spoken.">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>.) The prophet, in his vision of the future, calls even on the heathen (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-10.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, O you nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.">Jeremiah 31:10</a>) to rejoice in the restoration of the remnant of Israel, and pray for their prosperity. In "deliver" we have the same verb as in the "Hosanna" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-25.htm" title="Save now, I beseech you, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech you, send now prosperity.">Psalm 118:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>. The old bitterness of feeling was to pass away, and heathen and Israelite were to join together in a chorus of praise and prayer. The thought is the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-14.</span> - The restoration of Israel; its blessedness and joyousness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing with gladness,</span> etc. It is not stated who are addressed; but we may doubtless understand, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-10.htm">Isaiah 66:10</a>, "all ye who love him," whether Jews or Gentiles. The latter, too, are interested in the restoration of Israel, because Israel is as it were a "priest" or mediator for the other nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Among the chief of the nations;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because of the chief of the nations.</span> Israel is called the "chief of the nations" (so, with a cognate word for "chief," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>) because Jehovah has" chosen" it as his <span class="accented">peculium</span> (to use the language of the Vulgate), <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, and because no other nation "hath God so nigh unto them," and "hath statutes and judgments so righteous," as Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 God assures his people that he will again take them into covenant relation to himself. When brought very low, and difficulties appear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the church formerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort from former smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, are interested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, from everlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Those whom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by the influences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for what he has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs and expects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come; for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness of God shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin with more bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of their captivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father, and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that is good for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a future gathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And they figuratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and the plain and safe way in which they are led.</body></html>
