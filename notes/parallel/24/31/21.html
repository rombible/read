(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-15.htm" title="And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.">Ezekiel 39:15</a>.) The way which she had trodden when she was led out into captivity was to be re-trodden in the fulness of joy on her return. She was to pass in her joy through the self-same cities that had then seen her in her shame.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thee up waymarks.</span> The "virgin of Israel" is addressed. She is directed to mark out the road for the returning exiles. The command is obviously the. torical in form; the general sense is that the Israelites are to call to mind the road so familiar to their forefathers, though only known to themselves by tradition. The word rendered "waymarks" occurs again in 2 Kings 33:17 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-15.htm">Ezekiel 39:15</a>. It apparently means a stone pillar, which might be used either as a waymark or a sepulchral monument. The <span class="cmt_word">high heaps</span> seem to mean much the same thing; "signposts" would be a better rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Set thine heart toward the highway;</span> rather, <span class="accented">turn thy thoughts</span>, etc., for the heart is here evidently the symbol of the intellectual rather than the moral life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>, and many other passages). A passage in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a>) will occur to every one, in which a psalmist, longing at a distance for the services of the temple, pronounces blessed the man "in whose heart are the highways [to Zion];" here, it is true, "heart" has the double meaning of "mind" and "affections," but "highway" has almost exactly the same sense as in the passage before us. <span class="cmt_word">To these thy cities</span>. The unseen speaker is supposed to be in Palestine. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:21-26 The way from the bondage of sin to the liberty of God's children, is a high-way. It is plain, it is safe; yet none are likely to walk in it, unless they set their hearts towards it. They are encouraged by the promise of a new, unheard-of, extraordinary thing; a creation, a work of Almighty power; the human nature of Christ, formed and prepared by the power of the Holy Ghost: and this is here mentioned as an encouragement to the Jews to return to their own land. And a comfortable prospect is given them of a happy settlement there. Godliness and honesty God has joined: let no man think to put them asunder, or to make the one atone for the want of the other. In the love and favour of God the weary soul shall find rest, and the sorrowful shall find joy. And what can we see with more satisfaction than the good of Jerusalem, and peace upon Israel?</body></html>
