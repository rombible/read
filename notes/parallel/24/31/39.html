The name of the first, as signifying "the leper's hill" (the term being one that includes leprosy as well as other skin-diseases, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-20.htm" title="Or hunch back, or a dwarf, or that has a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken;">Leviticus 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-22.htm" title="Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a running sore, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the LORD.">Leviticus 22:22</a>), indicates probably a position outside the walls assigned as a dwelling to persons suffering from that disease, corresponding, as some think, with the hill on the north side of Jerusalem which Josephus describes as Bezetha (<span class= "ital">Wars, v.</span> 4, ? 2). Others, however, assign its position to the south-west corner of the walls. The name Gareb appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-38.htm" title="Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,">2Samuel 23:38</a> as belonging to one of David's thirty heroes, but there is nothing to connect him with the locality. Goath is a word of doubtful etymology. Some scholars (Hitzig) interpret it as "high-towering," and refer it to the height overlooking Kidron, afterwards surmounted by the tower Antonia. The Targum, however, paraphrases it as "the pool of the heifers," and connects the name with the verb for the lowing of that animal. By some writers it has been identified with Golgotha, but both topography and etymology are against this view.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Over against it upon the hill Gareb</span>; rather, <span class="accented">straight forward unto the hill Gareb.</span> The hill of Gareb is not mentioned elsewhere; its meaning is probably "Leper's Hill." It must, of course, have been outside the city, and may be identified (after Schleussner and Hitzig) with "the fourth hill, which is called Bezetha" (Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). <span class="cmt_word">To Goath;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to Goah.</span> But the reading of the Peshito, "to Gibeah," should probably be adopted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:35-40 As surely as the heavenly bodies will continue their settled course, according to the will of their Creator, to the end of time, and as the raging sea obeys him, so surely will the Jews be continued a separate people. Words can scarcely set forth more strongly the restoration of Israel. The rebuilding of Jerusalem, and its enlargement and establishment, shall be an earnest of the great things God will do for the gospel church. The personal happiness of every true believer, as well as the future restoration of Israel, is secured by promise, covenant, and oath. This Divine love passes knowledge; and to those who take hold upon it, every present mercy is an earnest of salvation.</body></html>
