A people pastoral, yet not nomadic--agricultural, yet sharing in the culture and safety of cities--this was the picture that rose up in Jeremiah's thoughts, in sharp contrast to the facts that actually surrounded him in the shape of devastated fields and pastures, with no flocks and herds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/4-26.htm" title="I beheld, and, see, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.">Jeremiah 4:26-29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The ideal of outward life exhibited by the prophets is still the agricultural and pastoral. Jeremiah puts this more forcibly than the Authorized Version represents. Instead of, <span class="cmt_word">And there shall dwell in Judah</span>, etc., he says, <span class="accented">And there shall dwell therein</span> (viz. in the land) <span class="accented">Judah and all his cities together as husbandmen, and they shall go about with flocks, i.e.</span> they shall attend to their ancient pursuits without let or hindrance from invaders (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-20.htm">Isaiah 32:20</a>). "Go about" (literally, <span class="accented">break up</span>) is the regular word for the periodical journeying of the nomad life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:21-26 The way from the bondage of sin to the liberty of God's children, is a high-way. It is plain, it is safe; yet none are likely to walk in it, unless they set their hearts towards it. They are encouraged by the promise of a new, unheard-of, extraordinary thing; a creation, a work of Almighty power; the human nature of Christ, formed and prepared by the power of the Holy Ghost: and this is here mentioned as an encouragement to the Jews to return to their own land. And a comfortable prospect is given them of a happy settlement there. Godliness and honesty God has joined: let no man think to put them asunder, or to make the one atone for the want of the other. In the love and favour of God the weary soul shall find rest, and the sorrowful shall find joy. And what can we see with more satisfaction than the good of Jerusalem, and peace upon Israel?</body></html>
