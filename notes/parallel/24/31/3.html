"From afar" (so we ought to render, rather than "of old") she sees Jehovah, with the eye of faith, approaching to redeem her; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a> and Isaiah 59:20 (only that in these passages it is to Jerusalem, and not to Babylon, that Jehovah "comes" as the Redeemer); also the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>, "I will save thee from afar," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-50.htm">Jeremiah 51:50</a>, quoted above. (Septuagint reads "unto him;" but an abrupt change of person is not uncommon in Hebrew.) Saying, <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I have loved thee,</span> etc. "Saying" is inserted to make the connection plainer. The genius of Hebrew does not require such a distinct indication of a change of speakers as our Western languages. For other instances of this, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-31.htm">Genesis 32:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With loving kindness have I drawn thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">do I continue loving kindness unto thee.</span> "To continue" is literally, <span class="accented">to draw out at length.</span> The idea is the same as that in the great prophecy which follows that of the suffering Saviour, "With everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>; comp. ver. 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 God assures his people that he will again take them into covenant relation to himself. When brought very low, and difficulties appear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the church formerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort from former smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, are interested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, from everlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Those whom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by the influences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for what he has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs and expects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come; for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness of God shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin with more bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of their captivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father, and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that is good for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a future gathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And they figuratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and the plain and safe way in which they are led.</body></html>
