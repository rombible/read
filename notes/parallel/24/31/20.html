On the former view, the words express the yearning of a father's heart towards the son whom he still loves in spite of all his faults. Jehovah wonders, as it were, at his affection for one who has been so rebellious. On the latter, they give prominence to the faults as having deprived him of all claim to love, even though the father's heart yearned towards the prodigal in pity. The former gives, beyond all doubt, the best meaning. In every word, whether of reproof or invitation, there was implied a loving remembrance.<p><span class= "bld">For since I spake against him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">As often as I speak to him. </span>The preposition can hardly have the meaning of "against," for which Jeremiah uses different words, and implies rather (as in the "communed with" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-39.htm" title="And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.">1Samuel 25:39</a>; "When she shall be spoken for," Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-8.htm" title="We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?">Song of Solomon 8:8</a>)--speaking with a view to win. By some commentators (Ewald) the word for "speak" is rendered "smite," but the ordinary rendering gives an adequate meaning. The original gives both for "earnestly remember" and "surely have mercy" the Hebrew idiom of reduplication--<span class= "ital">Remembering, I remember; pitying, I pity. </span>The thought expressed is that Jehovah could not bring himself to utter the sentence of rejection. His love turned to the penitent who turned to Him. We have something like a foreshadowing of the love of the father of the prodigal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-20.htm" title="And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.">Luke 15:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The Divine speaker asks, as it were in surprise, whether Ephraim, who has so flagrantly sinned against him, can really be his <span class="cmt_word">dear</span> (or, <span class="accented">precious</span>) <span class="cmt_word">son</span>, his <span class="cmt_word">pleasant child</span> (literally, <span class="accented">child of caressing, i.e.</span> one caressed). The latter expression occurs in a remarkable passage of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Since I spake against him;</span> rather, as <span class="accented">often as I spake against him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as often as I pronounced sentence against Ephraim - such a sentence as is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-21</a> (where the future tenses should he perfects) and Isaiah 28:1-4. We must remember that, with God, to speak is to perform. Often as Jehovah punished Israel, he still remembered him in love - a love which was the pledge of his future restoration to favour upon his true repentance. <span class="cmt_word">I do earnestly remember;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">verily</span> <span class="accented">remembered.</span> "To remember" is the Old Testament term for providential care (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-29.htm">Genesis 19:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My bowels are troubled;</span> literally, <span class="accented">sound, moan</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>). Something analogous to the thrilling sensation of deep human grief is predicated of Jehovah. Such is the "humility" of the God of revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:18-20 Ephraim (the ten tribes) is weeping for sin. He is angry at himself for his sin, and folly, and frowardness. He finds he cannot, by his own power, keep himself close with God, much less bring himself back when he is revolted. Therefore he prays, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned. His will was bowed to the will of God. When the teaching of God's Spirit went with the corrections of his providence, then the work was done. This is our comfort in affliction, that the Lord thinks upon us. God has mercy in store, rich mercy, sure mercy, suitable mercy, for all who seek him in sincerity.</body></html>
