Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.">Jeremiah 19:11</a>), filled with corpses lying unburied in the streets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-21.htm" title="The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword;

but in his vision of the restored city he sees it all cleansed from whatever was defiling, consecrated to Jehovah, and holy as the precincts of the Temple. It is, perhaps, not without significance in connection with this passage, that when the city was restored, the region above the "horse-gate" was repaired by the priests, who seem to have had their houses in that quarter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/3-28.htm" title="From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.">Nehemiah 3:28-29</a>). They appear to have been anxious to restore the sanctity of that over which Jeremiah had lamented as desecrated and defiled. The word for "ashes" was a technical one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10-11</a>) for the refuse which remained on the altar after a burnt-offering, and which was to be carried without the camp (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-12.htm" title="Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.">Leviticus 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm" title="And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp to a clean place.">Leviticus 6:11</a>). Probably this and the sweepings of the Temple were thrown into the valley of Hinnom.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - The southern boundary of the city. <span class="cmt_word">The whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes;</span> rather,... <span class="accented">even the dead bodies and the ashes.</span> It is assumed by most that Jeremiah means the valley of Hinnom, which, after its defilement by Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), had become a receptacle of rubbish and offal. It is, however, against this view that the word for "valley" is not <span class="accented">gai</span> (elsewhere connected with Hinnom), but <span class="accented">emek</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "deep lying plain." The "dead bodies" are the corpses of men and animals, destroyed by the judgment of God, and lying unburied; but where, seems uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Ashes</span>.

Words can scarcely set forth more strongly the restoration of Israel. The rebuilding of Jerusalem, and its enlargement and establishment, shall be an earnest of the great things God will do for the gospel church. The personal happiness of every true believer, as well as the future restoration of Israel, is secured by promise, covenant, and oath. This Divine love passes knowledge; and to those who take hold upon it, every present mercy is an earnest of salvation.</body></html>
