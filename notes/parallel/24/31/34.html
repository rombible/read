What good had come of all the machinery of ritual and of teaching which the Law of Israel had provided so abundantly? Those repeated exhortations on the part of preachers and prophets that men should "know the Lord," what did they present but the dreary monotony as of an "old worm-eaten homily"? To know Him, as indeed He is, required nothing less than a special revelation of His presence to each man's heart and spirit, and that revelation was now, for his comfort, promised for all who were willing to receive it as the special gift of the near or distant future which opened to his view in his vision of a restored Israel. Here also the words of Jeremiah echo those of an older prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm" title="And all your children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of your children.">Isaiah 54:13</a>), and find their fulfilment in those of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm" title="It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.">John 6:45</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I will forgive their iniquity . . .</span>--The second clause repeats the promise of the first, in a form which is, perhaps, from the necessity of the case, after the manner of men. Our thoughts of God as the All knowing preclude the idea of any limitation of His knowledge, such as the words "I will remember no more" imply. What is meant is that He will be to him who repents and knows Him as indeed He is, in His essential righteousness and love, as men are <span class= "ital">to </span>men when they "forget and forgive." He will treat the past offences, even though their inevitable consequences may continue, as though they had never been, so far as they affect the communion of the soul with God. He will, in the language of another prophet, "blot out" the sins which yet belong to the indelible and irrevocable past (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm" title="I, even I, am he that blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember your sins.">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-22.htm" title="I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins: return to me; for I have redeemed you.">Isaiah 44:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - On this verse, see note on the paragraph. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:27-34 The people of God shall become numerous and prosperous. In Heb 8:8,9, this place is quoted as the sum of the covenant of grace made with believers in Jesus Christ. Not, I will give them a new law; for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it; but the law shall be written in their hearts by the finger of the Spirit, as formerly written in the tables of stone. The Lord will, by his grace, make his people willing people in the day of his power. All shall know the Lord; all shall be welcome to the knowledge of God, and shall have the means of that knowledge. There shall be an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, at the time the gospel is published. No man shall finally perish, but for his own sins; none, who is willing to accept of Christ's salvation.</body></html>
