The backsliding daughter--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the adulterous yet now penitent wife--is described, like Gomer in the parable or history of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm" title="And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.">Hosea 2:7</a>, as hesitating between her lovers and her husband.<p><span class= "bld">A woman shall compass a man.</span>--The verse is obscure, and has received very different interpretations. It will be well to begin our inquiry with the meaning which the translators attached to it. On this point the following quotation from Shakespeare is decisive :--<p>"If I can check my erring love, I will;<p>If not, to <span class= "ital">compass </span>her I'll use my skill."<p><span class= "ital">Two Gentlemen of Verona, </span>ii. 4.<p>To "compass" is to woo and win. And this gives, it is believed, the true meaning. The Hebrew verb (which presents a striking assonance with the word for "backsliding") means literally "to go round about," and this (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm" title="I will wash my hands in innocence: so will I compass your altar, O LORD:">Psalm 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm" title="You are my hiding place; you shall preserve me from trouble; you shall compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.">Psalm 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-10.htm" title="Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusts in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.">Psalm 32:10</a>) as an act of reverential tenderness and love. In the normal order of man's life, the bridegroom woos the bride. In the spiritual relationship which the prophet has in view, this shall be inverted, and Israel, the erring but repentant wife, shall woo her Divine husband. The history of Gomer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.">Hosea 2:14-20</a> again presents a striking parallel. A like inversion of the normal order is indicated, though with a different meaning, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-1.htm" title="And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.">Isaiah 4:1</a>, where the seven women might be said to "compass" the one man. It may be noticed that the words used express the contrast of the two sexes in the strongest possible form. <span class= "ital">A female shall compass </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> <span class= "ital">woo</span>)<span class= "ital"> a male, </span>possibly as emphasising the fact that what the prophet describes was an exception to the normal order, not of human society only, but of the whole animal society. By some interpreters (Ewald) the words are rendered "a woman shall be turned into a man;" meaning that the weak shall be made strong, as a kind of contrast to the opposite kind of transformation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-6.htm" title="Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?">Jeremiah 30:6</a>; but this gives a far less satisfactory meaning, and the same may be said of such translations as "the woman shall protect the man," and "a woman shall put a man to flight." The notion that the words can in even the remotest degree be connected with the mystery of the Incarnation belongs to the region of dreams, and not of realities; and, lacking as it does the support of even any allusive reference to it in the New Testament, can only be regarded, in spite of the authority of the many Fathers and divines who have adopted it, as the outgrowth of a devout but uncritical imagination. The word used for "woman," indeed, absolutely excludes the idea of the virgin-birth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou go about?</span> We must suppose the Israelites to be hesitating whether to set out on their journey or not. They are now admonished to put away their rebellious reluctance, and a special reason for this is added. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath created</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hath decreed to create - <span class="cmt_word">a new thing in the earth</span> (or, <span class="accented">in the land</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a> which suggests that a complete reversal of ordinary experience is indicated, as indeed the word create of itself prepares us to expect. And what is this promise granted as a sign to reluctant Israel? <span class="cmt_word">A woman shall compass a man;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> instead of shyly keeping aloof, or worse (as hitherto), Israel, Jehovah's bride, shall, with eager affection, press around her Divine husband. The phrase, however, is extremely difficult. Of other explanations, the most plausible philologically is that of Schnurrer and Gesenius, "a woman shall protect a man" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>). The part of a sentinel, pacing round and round his charge, seems most unfitted for a woman. When enemies are abroad, it is the men's natural duty to perform this part for the women. But in the coming age, the country shall be so free from danger that the places of men and women may safely be reversed. But would a paradox of this kind be likely to be uttered in this connection? Surely a clearer statement would be necessary to remove the reluctance of the Israelites. Vers. 19, 20 suggest that Ephraim needed reassurance as to the attitude of Jehovah towards him. The promise of ver. 22, as explained above, would give precisely the needed strength and comfort. The exposition of St. Jerome and other Fathers, that the birth of Christ from a virgin is referred to, is altogether inadmissible, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the nouns which form the subject and the predicate respectively indicate sex, not age, and the first in particular cannot be tortured so as to mean "virgin;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> there is no article to confine the reference to any particular persons. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:21-26 The way from the bondage of sin to the liberty of God's children, is a high-way. It is plain, it is safe; yet none are likely to walk in it, unless they set their hearts towards it. They are encouraged by the promise of a new, unheard-of, extraordinary thing; a creation, a work of Almighty power; the human nature of Christ, formed and prepared by the power of the Holy Ghost: and this is here mentioned as an encouragement to the Jews to return to their own land. And a comfortable prospect is given them of a happy settlement there. Godliness and honesty God has joined: let no man think to put them asunder, or to make the one atone for the want of the other. In the love and favour of God the weary soul shall find rest, and the sorrowful shall find joy. And what can we see with more satisfaction than the good of Jerusalem, and peace upon Israel?</body></html>
