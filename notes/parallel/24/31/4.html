The "tabret" was a musical instrument of the drum type, somewhat like the Spanish or Italian tambourine, with bells attached to the metal hoop.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will build thee.</span> A nation, like a family, is frequently compared to a building (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">O virgin of Israel</span>. The people of Israel is personified as a virgin (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Adorned with thy tabrets,</span> The expression will not, of course, bear to be logically criticized, for it was not the whole people who went out with "tabrets" or "timbrels," but the "damsels," who, it is true, formed an important part of religious processions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>), and doubtless of secular ones also (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>). Joyousness is an essential part of the Biblical ideal both of religion and of a normal state of society: "The joy of the Lord is your strength." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-9 God assures his people that he will again take them into covenant relation to himself. When brought very low, and difficulties appear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the church formerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort from former smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, are interested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, from everlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Those whom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by the influences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for what he has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs and expects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come; for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness of God shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin with more bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of their captivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father, and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that is good for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a future gathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And they figuratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and the plain and safe way in which they are led.</body></html>
