The germ is found in the phrase "drunken, but not with wine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm" title="Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry you out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.">Isaiah 29:9</a>), and the thought rising out of that germ that the effect of the wrath of Jehovah is to cause an impotence and confusion like that of drunkenness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-3.htm" title="You have showed your people hard things: you have made us to drink the wine of astonishment.">Psalm 60:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>). The "bottle" in this case is not the "skin" commonly used for that purpose, but the earthen jar or flagon, the "potter's vessel" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm" title="And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.">Isaiah 30:14</a>, the "pitcher" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm" title="The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!">Lamentations 4:2</a>. So taken we find an anticipation of the imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;">Jeremiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>. The prophet is bidden to go and proclaim to the people a dark saying, which in its literal sense would seem to them the idlest of all truisms. They would not understand that the "wine" of which he spoke was the wrath of Jehovah, and therefore they would simply repeat his words half in astonishment, half in mockery, "Do we not know this? What need to hear it from a prophet's lips?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - Here another symbol is introduced - a symbolic phrase rather than a symbolic action. The first symbol referred to the people as a whole; the second represents the fate of the individual members of the people. The words, <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the lord God of Israel</span>, are omitted in the Septuagint, and certainly the form of the following phrase seems hardly worthy of so solemn an introduction. <span class="cmt_word">Every bottle</span>. It is an earthenware bottle, or pitcher, which seems from Ver. 13 to be meant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>), though the Septuagint renders here <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The kings that sit upon David's throne</span>; rather, that <span class="accented">sit for David upon his throne</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as David's heirs and successors. The plural "kings" is to include all the kings who reigned during the final period of impending ruin. <span class="cmt_word">With drunkenness</span>. The effect of the "wine-cup of [the Divine] fury" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Dash them one against another.</span> This is merely the development of the figure of the pitchers; not a prediction of civil war. The pitchers, when cast down, must of course fall together into pieces. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:12-17 As the bottle was fitted to hold the wine, so the sins of the people made them vessels of wrath, fitted for the judgments of God; with which they should be filled till they caused each other's destruction. The prophet exhorts them to give glory to God, by confessing their sins, humbling themselves in repentance, and returning to his service. Otherwise they would be carried into other countries in all the darkness of idolatry and wickedness. All misery, witnessed or foreseen, will affect a feeling mind, but the pious heart must mourn most over the afflictions of the Lord's flock.</body></html>
