It will be noticed that, except in two cases, the names of the mothers of the reigning kings of Judah are scrupulously mentioned in the Books of Kings. This and the title of "mistress" are indications of the high rank they enjoyed in the social system. In the case of Asa, we are told that he removed his mother, Maachah, from her position as "mistress," or queen-mother, on account of her idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). The political value of the station is strikingly shown by the ease with which Athaliah, as queen-mother, usurped the supreme authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>.). From an historical point of view, the "queen-mother" of the Jews is a most interesting personage; she is a relic of the primitive age in which relationship was reckoned with regard to the mother (so with the Accadians, Etruseans, Finns, etc.). It should be added, however, that once (viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-19.htm">1 Kings 11:19</a>) the same title, "mistress," is applied to the queen-consort. <span class="cmt_word">Humble yourselves, sit down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sit down in abase</span>-sent; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> take the station suitable for your abased circumstances (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Your principalities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your</span> <span class="accented">head</span>. <span class="accented">ornaments</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-27 Here is a message sent to king Jehoiakim, and his queen. Their sorrows would be great indeed. Do they ask, Wherefore come these things upon us? Let them know, it is for their obstinacy in sin. We cannot alter the natural colour of the skin; and so is it morally impossible to reclaim and reform these people. Sin is the blackness of the soul; it is the discolouring of it; we were shapen in it, so that we cannot get clear of it by any power of our own. But Almighty grace is able to change the Ethiopian's skin. Neither natural depravity, nor strong habits of sin, form an obstacle to the working of God, the new-creating Spirit. The Lord asks of Jerusalem, whether she is determined not be made clean. If any poor slave of sin feels that he could as soon change his nature as master his headstrong lusts, let him not despair; for things impossible to men are possible with God. Let us then seek help from Him who is mighty to save.</body></html>
