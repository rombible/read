and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>, perhaps also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-2.htm" title="If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, said the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings: yes, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.">Malachi 2:2</a>, "give glory by confessing the truth, even though that truth be a sin that involves punishment." "Confess your guilt ere it be too late for pardon." This fits in better with the context than the more general sense of "ascribing praise to God."<p><span class= "bld">Before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the mountains of twilight, </span>the word used being employed exclusively first of the coolness and then of the gathering gloom of evening twilight, and never of the dawn. (Compare its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-9.htm" title="Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:">Job 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-15.htm" title="The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguises his face.">Job 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm" title="In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:">Proverbs 7:9</a>.) The fact that the shadows are deepening is obviously one of the vivid touches of the figurative language used. The "gloaming" of the dusk is to pass on into the midnight darkness of the "shadow of death." The same thought is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-10.htm" title="We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.">Isaiah 59:10</a>, and (probably with some reference to this very passage) in our Lord's words, "If a man walk in the night he stumbleth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm" title="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.">John 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.">John 12:35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give glory</span>, etc. Let your tribute to your King be that of humble submission to his will. The precise application of the phrase must be derived from the context (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-2.htm">Malachi 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon the dark mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon mountains of twilight</span>.

As Judah is walking along, the hitherto even tenor of his way gives place to huge mountains wrapped in an impenetrable dusk, over which he will stumble and fall if he does not repent in time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:12-17 As the bottle was fitted to hold the wine, so the sins of the people made them vessels of wrath, fitted for the judgments of God; with which they should be filled till they caused each other's destruction. The prophet exhorts them to give glory to God, by confessing their sins, humbling themselves in repentance, and returning to his service. Otherwise they would be carried into other countries in all the darkness of idolatry and wickedness. All misery, witnessed or foreseen, will affect a feeling mind, but the pious heart must mourn most over the afflictions of the Lord's flock.</body></html>
