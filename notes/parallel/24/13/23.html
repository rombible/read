The evil of Judah was too deep-ingrained to be capable of spontaneous reformation. There remained nothing but the sharp discipline of the exile. The invasion of Tirhakah and Pharaoh-nechoh, the presence of Ethiopians among the servants of the royal household (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-10.htm" title="Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.">Jeremiah 38:10</a>), the intercourse with the upper valley of the Nile implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm" title="Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.">Psalm 68:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4</a>, had made the swarthy forms of Africa familiar objects. Possibly the use of leopard-skins by Ethiopian princes and warriors, as seen on Egyptian monuments and described by Herodotus (vii. 69), had associated the two thoughts together in the prophet's mind. If the king's household were present (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-18.htm" title="Say to the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.">Jeremiah 13:18</a>), he may have pointed to such an one, Ebedmelech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-10.htm" title="Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.">Jeremiah 38:10</a>), or another so arrayed, in illustration of his words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-27 Here is a message sent to king Jehoiakim, and his queen. Their sorrows would be great indeed. Do they ask, Wherefore come these things upon us? Let them know, it is for their obstinacy in sin. We cannot alter the natural colour of the skin; and so is it morally impossible to reclaim and reform these people. Sin is the blackness of the soul; it is the discolouring of it; we were shapen in it, so that we cannot get clear of it by any power of our own. But Almighty grace is able to change the Ethiopian's skin. Neither natural depravity, nor strong habits of sin, form an obstacle to the working of God, the new-creating Spirit. The Lord asks of Jerusalem, whether she is determined not be made clean. If any poor slave of sin feels that he could as soon change his nature as master his headstrong lusts, let him not despair; for things impossible to men are possible with God. Let us then seek help from Him who is mighty to save.</body></html>
