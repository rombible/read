that they might be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.">Jeremiah 13:11</a>. Of all garments worn by man the girdle was that most identified with the man's activity, nearest to his person. The "linen girdle" was part of Jeremiah's priestly dress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-40.htm" title="And for Aaron's sons you shall make coats, and you shall make for them girdles, and bonnets shall you make for them, for glory and for beauty.">Exodus 28:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm" title="He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen turban shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.">Leviticus 16:4</a>), and this also was significant in the interpretation of the symbolic act. Israel, represented as the girdle of Jehovah, had been chosen for consecrated uses. The word "get" implies the act of purchasing, and this too was not without its symbolic significance.<p><span class= "bld">Put it not in water.</span>--The work of the priest as a rule necessarily involved frequent washings both of flesh and garments. The command in this case was therefore exceptional. The unwashed girdle was to represent the guilt of the people unpurified by any real contact with the "clean water" of repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a>). In the "filthy garments" of Joshua, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-3.htm" title="Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.">Zechariah 3:3</a>, we have a like symbolism. This seems a much more natural interpretation than that which starts from the idea that water would spoil the girdle, and sees in the command the symbol of God's care for His people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - The entire people of the Jews is like a good-for-nothing apron. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A linen girdle</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a linen apron</span>. "Girdle" is one of the meanings of the Hebrew ('<span class="accented">ezor</span>), but is here unsuitable. As Ver. 11 shows, it is an inner garment that is meant, one that "cleaveth to the loins of a man" (in fact, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Septuagint, the <span class="accented">lumbare</span> of the Vulgate). The corresponding Arabic word, '<span class="accented">izar</span>, has, according to Lane, the meaning of "waist-wrapper.' Israel was to Jehovah in as close a relation spiritually as that in which the inner garment referred to is to him who wears it materially. There is an Arabic proverb which well illustrates this: "He is to me in place of an '<span class="accented">izar"</span> (Freytag, 'Studium der Arab. Spraohe,' p. 298). "A linen apron" may perhaps be specified, because linen was the material of the priestly dress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), and Israel was to be spiritually" a kingdom of priests." But this is not absolutely necessary. The common man used linen in his dress as well as the priest; the only difference between them was that the priest was confined to linen garments. But an ,' apron" would in any case naturally be made of linen. <span class="cmt_word">Linen</span>; literally, flax (a product of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Put it not in water</span>. The object of the prohibition is well stated by St. Jerome. It was at once to symbolize the character of the people of Israel, stiff and impure, like unwashed linen, and to suggest the fate in store for it (Ver. 9). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-11 It was usual with the prophets to teach by signs. And we have the explanation, ver. 9-11. The people of Israel had been to God as this girdle. He caused them to cleave to him by the law he gave them, the prophets he sent among them, and the favours he showed them. They had by their idolatries and sins buried themselves in foreign earth, mingled among the nations, and were so corrupted that they were good for nothing. If we are proud of learning, power, and outward privileges, it is just with God to wither them. The minds of men should be awakened to a sense of their guilt and danger; yet nothing will be effectual without the influences of the Spirit.</body></html>
