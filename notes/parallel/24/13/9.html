<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-11.htm" title="And Joab said to the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.">2Samuel 18:11</a>), it was the natural symbol of the outward glory of a kingdom. As Jeremiah was a priest, we may, perhaps, think of the embroidered girdle "for glory and for beauty "of the priestly dress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-40.htm" title="And for Aaron's sons you shall make coats, and you shall make for them girdles, and bonnets shall you make for them, for glory and for beauty.">Exodus 28:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come on them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.">Ezekiel 44:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-11 It was usual with the prophets to teach by signs. And we have the explanation, ver. 9-11. The people of Israel had been to God as this girdle. He caused them to cleave to him by the law he gave them, the prophets he sent among them, and the favours he showed them. They had by their idolatries and sins buried themselves in foreign earth, mingled among the nations, and were so corrupted that they were good for nothing. If we are proud of learning, power, and outward privileges, it is just with God to wither them. The minds of men should be awakened to a sense of their guilt and danger; yet nothing will be effectual without the influences of the Spirit.</body></html>
