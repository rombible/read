Nothing remained for one who found his labours fruitless but silent sorrow and intercession. The "secret places" find a parallel in our Lord's withdrawal for prayer into a "solitary place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-35.htm" title="And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.">Mark 1:35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - Should all admonitions be in vain, Jeremiah will return (like Samuel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-35.htm">1 Samuel 15:35</a>) and give vent to his sorrowful emotion. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord's flock</span>.

The prophet exhorts them to give glory to God, by confessing their sins, humbling themselves in repentance, and returning to his service. Otherwise they would be carried into other countries in all the darkness of idolatry and wickedness. All misery, witnessed or foreseen, will affect a feeling mind, but the pious heart must mourn most over the afflictions of the Lord's flock.</body></html>
