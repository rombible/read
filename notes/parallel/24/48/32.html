Sibmah appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-19.htm" title="And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,">Joshua 13:19</a> as assigned to the Reubenites, in the region east of Jordan. After that date it does not appear again till we find it in these prophetic notices. Jerome (<span class= "ital">Comm. in Isa. </span>Jeremiah 5) names it as a strong city about half a mile from Heshbon, but its site has not been identified by modern travellers. It would appear from these notices to have been famous for vineyards that extended to Jazer. The city so named, identified with the modern <span class= "ital">Es Szir, </span>had belonged to the Amorites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-32.htm" title="And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.">Numbers 21:32</a>, there spelt <span class= "ital">Jaazer</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and lay between Heshbon and Bashan, about fifteen miles north of the former city. It passed afterwards into the possession of the Gadites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm" title="And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;">Joshua 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm" title="And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the middle of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:">2Samuel 24:5</a>), and was evidently, when the two prophets wrote, in that of the Moabites. The phrase "weeping of Jazer" implies that it was to share in the desolation of Sibmah. The "sea of Jazer" (if the text is right, the LXX. giving "city") must have been some inland lake or pond, which has not since been identified. The "sea" of the parallel passage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm" title="For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even to Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.">Isaiah 16:8</a> is commonly interpreted of the Dead Sea. The "summer fruits" were the figs and pomegranates which were commonly cultivated together with the vine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - Shortened from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8, 9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With the weeping of Jaser;</span> rather, <span class="accented">more than the weeping of Jazer.</span> This may mean either "more than I weep for Jazer" (which is favoured by the insertion of "for thee") or more than Jazer weeps" (for the devastated vineyards of Sibmah); comp. Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span> The site of Jazer is placed by Seetzen between Ramoth (Salt) and Heshbon, where some ruins called Sir are now found. "Sibmah," according to St. Jerome, was not more than half a mile from Heshbon. King Mesha is thought to refer to it under the form Seran, miswritten for Seban (Sebam - so the form should be read - is an Old Testament version of the name; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>); see inscription on Moabite Stone, line 13. It appears to have been famous for its vineyards; and Seetzen tolls us that grapes and raisins of specially good quality are still carried from the neighbouring Salt to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Thy plants are gone over the sea;</span> rather, <span class="accented">thy shoots passed over the sea.</span> The prophet here describes the extensive range of these vines. The northern limit of their culture was Jazer, its southern or western file further shore of "the sea," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Dead Sea. By a touch of poetic hyperbole the prophet traces the excellence of vines such as those of En-gedi (on the western bank of the Dead Sea) to a Moabitish origin. The reference to <span class="cmt_word">the sea of Jazer</span> throws the whole passage into confusion. There is no lake or large pool at present to be found at Jazer, and the simplest explanation is that a scribe repeated the word "sea" by mistake. The true text will then be simply," they reached unto Jazer." <span class="cmt_word">The spoiler.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a> has the more picturesque expression, "the shouting," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wild battlecry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
