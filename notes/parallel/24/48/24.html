These are, however, some sixty miles north of Heshbon, and this has been thought adverse to the identification. On the other hand, the expression "far and near" indicates that Jeremiah takes in the more distant cities to which the power of Moab may have extended. From the mention of "the palaces of Kirioth" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm" title="But I will send a fire on Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:">Amos 2:2</a>, it appears to have been a place of importance.

The Moabite town, identified as above with the <span class= "ital">Buzrah </span>of the Ha-ran, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/5-26.htm" title="And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great:">1 Maccabees 5:26</a> as Bosora, one of the towns of Galaad or Gilead, and in Roman history as Bostra, the birthplace of the Emperor Philip, known as the Arabian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kerioth</span>.

The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
