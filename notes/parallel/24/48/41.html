Another possible rendering is, <span class="accented">The cities are taken</span>, and this certainly agrees better with the parallel line. But a plural of <span class="accented">kiryah</span>, a city, does not occur elsewhere. If the identification of Kerioth with Ar-moab, the capital of Moab, be accepted (see on ver. 24), the equalization of Kerioth and "the strongholds" seems to be a stumbling block. <span class="cmt_word">Strongholds</span>; or, <span class="accented">mountain fastnesses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
