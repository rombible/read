The LXX., which adopts the meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm" title="For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.">Jeremiah 17:6</a>, here strangely enough gives "as a wild ass in the wilderness." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm" title="In the LORD put I my trust: how say you to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?">Psalm 11:1</a> gives us an example of a like comparison. Here probably there is, as before, a paronomasia on the name of the Moabite city Aroer, which closely resembles the Hebrew word for "heath." In thus finding an ominous significance in the names of cities, Jeremiah follows in the wake of Micah 1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Flee, save your lives;</span> literally, <span class="accented">your souls</span>. The prophet's human feeling prompts him to this counsel; but he knows full well that a life of abject misery is the utmost that can be hoped for. <span class="cmt_word">And be like the heath in the wilderness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">your souls</span>) <span class="accented">shall be like destitute ones in the wilderness</span>. Imagine the case of one who has been robbed of everything, and left alone in the desert; not less miserable is that of the Moabite fugitives. The word rendered "the heath" (<span class="accented">aro'er</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> either miswritten for <span class="accented">ar'ar</span>, which occurs in the sense of "destitute" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> (see note), or also a rare plural form of the same word. The sense remains the same. It is tempting to see an allusion to one of the towns called Aroer (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>). But the only Aroer the prophet could be thinking of is that on the Amen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>), which could not be described as "in the wilderness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.</body></html>
