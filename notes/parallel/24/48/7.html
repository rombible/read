He is identified by Jerome (<span class= "ital">Comm. </span>on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm" title="He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.">Isaiah 15:2</a>) with the Baal-peor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm" title="And Israel joined himself to Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.">Numbers 25:3</a>. The name is prominent in the Moabite Inscription as that of the national deity, who subdues the people of his rival, Jehovah. The captivity of the idol implies, of course, that of the people The "works" in which Moab is said to have trusted are represented in the LXX. and Vulgate as "fortresses," but the word is not used in this sense elsewhere, and it is more probable that the prophet represents Moab as relying on its past achievements and deeds of prowess. The last words of the verse are an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm" title="And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, said the LORD.">Amos 1:15</a>.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In thy works;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either "in thy evil deeds" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>) or "in thy idols" (frequently called "the work of men's hands," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>, and sometimes simply "works," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-12.htm">Isaiah 57:12</a>; comp. Isaiah L 31). <span class="cmt_word">Chemoah</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> Moab is called "people of Chemosh," the patron-god being the king and lord of his people. In accordance with the strictly localizing theory of the nature of deity, current among primitive nations, Chemosh is said to go into captivity together with his worshippers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>). This helps us to understand the idolatry into which the Jews fell during the Exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>); they imagined that Jehovah himself was "in captivity," and restrained from putting forth his power on behalf of his worshippers. The text reading is not Chemosh, but Chemish; the latter form does not occur elsewhere, but has been thought to illustrate the name of the Hittite city Carchemish (the Hittites or their predecessors may have been worshippers of this deity), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "castle of Chemosh." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.</body></html>
