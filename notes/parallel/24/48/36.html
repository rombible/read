His heart becomes, as it were, musical in its groans and sighs. He cannot look on the panic-stricken and mourning city without sharing in its misery. In the baldness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm" title="Cut off your hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.">Jeremiah 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm" title="Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:">Jeremiah 16:6</a>), the clipped beard, the cuttings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm" title="Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm" title="That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 41:5</a>), the sackcloth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-8.htm" title="For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.">Jeremiah 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm" title="O daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come on us.">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm" title="Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.">Joel 1:8</a>) we have the wonted signs of mourning for the dead. The "pipe" is chosen rather than the harp, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a>, because it had come to be the recognised music for funerals (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm" title="And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,">Matthew 9:23</a>).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36-42.</span> - The description of Moab's lamentations continued. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - Based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Like pipes.</span> Isaiah has, "like the harp [or, 'lute']." The pipe, or flute, was specially used at funeral ceremonies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-32.htm">Luke 7:32</a>), and therefore, perhaps, seemed to Jeremiah more appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Because the riches</span>, etc. This is, no doubt, what we should have expected, but this is not what Jeremiah wrote; "because" should rather be <span class="accented">therefore.</span> Jeremiah simply transferred a clause (substantially at least) from his original, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a>, but into a context where it stands rather less naturally. The meaning of the words in Isaiah is that, the desolation being so great, the Moabites shall carry away as much of their goods as they can. In this new context, however, we can only explain this unexpected "therefore" by referring to a habit of the Israelitish mind by which that which contributed to a result was regarded as worked purposely for that result. Good instances of this habit are <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>; comp. Winer's 'New Testament Grammar' (Clark), pp. 573, 574, especially note 1 on p. 574, though the idiom also occurs in Old Testament passages in which the religious view of life is hardly traceable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
