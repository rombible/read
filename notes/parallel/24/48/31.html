The "I" that speaks is neither Jehovah nor the prophet, but the unnamed mourner, who in the next clause appears in the third person ("she shall mourn," the English "mine heart" having no equivalent in the Hebrew) as the representative of those who mourn for Moab. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm" title="And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.">Jeremiah 48:33</a>, "I have caused wine to fail" appears as the utterance of Jehovah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm" title="Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall you mourn; surely they are stricken.">Isaiah 16:7</a>, of which the whole passage is a free reproduction, Moab is named as the mourner.

Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;">Isaiah 15:1</a>. The place was obviously an important stronghold. The Targum on Isaiah and Jeremiah renders it by <span class= "ital">Crac, </span>and this has led to its being identified with the modern <span class= "ital">Kerak, </span>occupying a strong position on one of the Moabite mountains to the south-east of the Dead Sea. The name, which signifies "City of the Sun," may indicate its connection with that form of nature-worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - Based upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. Moab cannot escape the catastrophe, for his moral basis is utterly insecure. "Therefore," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Will I howl.</span> It is at first sight strange that the prophet should speak thus sympathetically after the strong language in ver. 26. But the fact is that an inspired prophet has, as it were, a double personality. Sometimes his human feelings seem quite lost in the consciousness of his message; sometimes (and especially in Jeremiah) the natural, emotional life refuses to be thus restrained, and will have itself expressed. <span class="cmt_word">All Moab;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Moab in all its districts, both north and south of the Amen, or, at any rate, the fugitive populations. Mine heart <span class="cmt_word">shall mourn.</span> The Authorized Version effaces one of the points of difference between Jeremiah and his original. The former leaves the subject indefinite - <span class="accented">one shall mourn.</span> For the men of Kir-heres. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a> has "for the raisin cakes of Kir-heres" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the cakes of pressed grapes, for which Kir-heres was specially famous) - a much more expressive phrase. Jeremiah, <span class="accented">or his scribe</span>, has changed <span class="accented">ashishe</span> into <span class="accented">anshe</span>, and the Targum and Septuagint have adopted this weak reading in Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
