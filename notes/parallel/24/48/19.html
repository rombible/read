There were several Aroers (one belonged to the Ammonites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), but as the enemy is driving the Moabites southward, the Aroer here intended can only be the town by the Arnon, which separated Moab proper first of all from the kingdom of the Amorites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>), and afterwards from the territory of the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>). The picture drawn in this verse is singularly appropriate to the site of Arnon, "just by the edge of the arterial highway of Moab," and commanding a complete view of the pass of the Arnon (Tristram, 'Land of Moab,' p. 132). There is the same variety of statement as to the Israetitish tribe to which Aroer belonged as in the case of Dibon (see ver. 18). <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a> speaks in favour of Reuben; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a> in favour of Gad. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
