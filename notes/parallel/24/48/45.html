lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>), and find no protection there.<p><span class= "bld">A fire shall come forth out of Heshbon . . .</span>--The words are interesting as being a quotation from a fragment of an old poem, probably from the "Book of the Wars of the Lord," which is also to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>. Heshbon, at the time of the Exodus the capital of the Amorites, is here identified with Sihon as their king. In the prophet's application of the words, the Moabites are represented as taking refuge under the walls of Heshbon, but, instead of finding shelter, fire bursts out from walls and gates. They have come to look on its conflagration. The flames spread far and near. They devour the "corner" as of the beard, the hair on the crown of the head. The symbolism of destruction is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>. In the "tumultuous ones" (literally, <span class= "ital">children of tumult</span>) we have the panic-stricken clamorous crowds of the Moabite fugitives. The phrase in the Hebrew is nearly the same as "the children of Seth" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - Apparently quoted from memory from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, except the first clause; the application, however, is peculiar to this passage. <span class="cmt_word">They that fled,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">The fugitives stand without strength in the shadow of Heshbon.</span> There is a difficulty here, for, according to ver. 2, the hostile raid into Moab started from Heshbon. Surely the fugitives would not think of escaping northwards, much less would they be able to elude the vigilance of the foe and reach Heshbon. But it is not surprising that the author of so long a poem should now and then make a slip; the author of the Book of Job is sometimes inconsistent with the Prologue, and ver. 2 is as far away from the passage before us as the Prologue of Job is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-18.htm">Job 19:18</a>. Nor can we be absolutely certain that our prophecy is exactly as Jeremiah wrote it. <span class="cmt_word">Shall come forth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">hath come forth</span> (<span class="accented">or, cometh forth</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>From the midst of Sihon.</span> Sihon being, perhaps, regarded as the leader and representative of his warriors. <span class="cmt_word">The corner of Moab;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the sides</span> (literally, <span class="accented">side</span>, used collectively) <span class="accented">of Moab.<span class="cmt_word"></span> The tumultuous ones;</span> literally, sons of <span class="accented">tumult</span>, a poetical phrase for warriors. The prophet has substituted the more common word <span class="accented">shaon</span> for its synonym <span class="accented">sheth.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
