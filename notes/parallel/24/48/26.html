At an earlier point the prophet said that it was the callousness produced by long prosperity (ver. 11); but here another sin is mentioned - Moab's haughty contempt of Jehovah. "For this it deserves that its contempt should be thrown back upon itself, by its being made, like a drunken man, the scorn of all" (Ewald). The figure is, no doubt, a coarse one, but not unnatural in the oratory (we must put aside inspiration, which leaves the forms of speech untouched) of a rude people like the Jews. It occurs not unfrequently elsewhere; see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15, 16</a>; and, for milder examples of the figure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-13.htm">Jeremiah 13:13</a> and 25. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make ye him drunken.</span> The command is issued to the agents of the Divine wrath (comp. vers. 10, 21). <span class="cmt_word">He magnified himself against the Lord.</span> Offences against Israel being also offences against Israel's God (see Jephthah's striking words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-23.htm">Judges 11:23, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall wallow;</span> rather, <span class="accented">shall fall heavily</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shall clap</span> - a pregnant expression). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
