This last feature gives point to the words of the prophet here. Its waters will not save its inhabitants from the thirst which falls on those who are dragged as captives into exile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dibon</span>; now <span class="accented">Diban</span>, one of the chief towns of Moab, on two adjacent hills, now covered with ruins (Tristram), in the plain of Medeba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>), north of Aroer and the Amen. Here the famous Moabite Stone (on which see Dr. Ginsburg's exhaustive monograph), with the inscription of King Mesha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>), was found, which, after having been broke up and pieced together, has now found a resting place in the Louvre. It is difficult to say to which Israelitish tribe Dibon was, strictly speaking, attached; for while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a> it is given to Reuben, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a> and in the Moabite Stone (line 10) it is assigned to Gad, Apparently the Israelitish population fluctuated. Sometimes Gad was the most adventurous in Occupying Moabitish territory, sometimes Reuben. On the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the daughter</span>, etc., see note on Jeremiah 46:19. The form of the first verse haft is modelled on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>. Sit in thirst. The expression is unexampled, and it is possible that we should alter one of the vowel points (which constitute no part of the Massoretic text), rendering, "sit in thirsty (ground)," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dust (comp. the parallel passage; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). Or there may be a less used collateral form of the Hebrew for "thirsty" (<span class="accented">came</span>). Canon Tristram speaks of the "waterless plain" of Diban ('Land of Moab,' p. 132). <span class="cmt_word">Thy strongholds.</span> It appears from the Moabite Stone that Diben was the centre of a district which was reckoned as belonging to it; so at least we may account for the phrase, "all Dibon was submissive" (line 28). Compare the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>, "Heshbon, and all the villages thereof" (comp. on Jeremiah 49:2). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
