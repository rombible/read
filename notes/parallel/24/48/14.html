The prophet points to the fact that the pride is brought low. She, too, is subject, like other nations, to invasion and defeat. He summons her people to wail for her overthrow. The "staff" is the sceptre of the ruler, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm" title="The LORD shall send the rod of your strength out of Zion: rule you in the middle of your enemies.">Psalm 110:2</a>. The "rod" is the stick with which a man walks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-10.htm" title="I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.">Genesis 32:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm" title="And thus shall you eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.">Exodus 12:11</a>), but which may also be used as a weapon. The epithet "beautiful" perhaps points to the splendour of a royal staff or wand of ivory and gold.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We are mighty;</span> rather, we are heroes. The Hebrew is <span class="accented">gibborim</span>, the name of David's select warriors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>). The exclamation is designed to represent vividly to the mind the sinful vain glory specially characteristic of Moab. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
