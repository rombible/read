(See Notes there.) The relations between Moab and Israel had for a long period been more or less uneasy. The former had been tributary to the latter under Ahab, but on his death Mesha revolted, and a war ensued, which ended in the defeat of the Moabites by the allied forces of Israel, Judah, and Edom (2 Kings 3). They repeated their attack, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-20.htm" title="And Elisha died, and they buried him.

Jerome places it at a distance of ten miles west of Medaba, as one of the cities rebuilt by the Reubenites, but it has not been identified. Misgab, the "high fort" or "citadel" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-12.htm" title="And the fortress of the high fort of your walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.">Isaiah 25:12</a>, has shared the same fate, but has been referred by some writers to Kir-Moab, or Kir-heres, as the chief fortified city of the country (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm" title="Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; my heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.">Jeremiah 48:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm" title="Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he has gotten are perished.">Jeremiah 48:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab.

The article which is prefixed to it in the Hebrew has led Frst (Lexicon) to take it in a wider sense, as meaning the plateau or highland country of Moab generally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - The prophet foresees the calamity of Moab, and the attendant confusion and dismay.

"The double city."

The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.</body></html>
