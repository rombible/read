The panic-cry of the one city was echoed in the other; it reached even to Jahaz (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-21.htm" title="And judgment is come on the plain country; on Holon, and on Jahazah, and on Mephaath,">Jeremiah 48:21</a>), to the south-west of Heshbon.<p><span class= "bld">From Zoar even unto Horonaim . . .</span>--Both names represent the south district of Moab. In the "heifer of three years old" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm" title="My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee to Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.">Isaiah 15:5</a>) many critics find simply a proper name, "the third Eglath," and conjecture that it was either one of three towns having the same name, or part of a <span class= "ital">tripolis </span>or tripartite city, the other two members of which were Zoar and Horonaim. Nothing is known, however, of any town so constituted, and the epithet of the "third-year heifer," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a heifer not brought under the yoke, would be a suitable name enough for either Zoar or Horonaim, as a virgin fortress, as yet untaken by the foe. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-16.htm" title="For Israel slides back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.">Hosea 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-11.htm" title="And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loves to tread out the corn; but I passed over on her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.">Hosea 10:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</span>--Recent travellers, Seetzen and De Saulcy, have found a brook Nimrah, with a mass of ruins near it, near the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. The Nimrah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-36.htm" title="And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.">Numbers 32:36</a>; Josh. 14:27, is probably too far to the north. Tristram (<span class= "ital">Land of Israel, </span>p. 54) identifies it with the <span class= "ital">Wady-Shaib </span>near the fords of the Jordan, and possibly with the Bethabara of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4-6</a>. The cry of one town echoes to another, and is taken up afresh by its terrified inhabitants. Heshbon and Elealeh lay on eminences but a short distance apart, so that the shrill cry of lamentation would be heard far away in the southeast at Jahaz. Zoar and Horonaim both lay in the southern half of Moah (see on vers. 3, 4). <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old.</span> If this is the right rendering, the phrase is descriptive of Horonaim, which may, in the time of Jeremiah, have been a "virgin fortress." But the phrase, thus understood, comes in very oddly, and in the parallel passage in Isaiah it stands, not after Horonaim, but after Zoar; it hardly seems likely that there were two Gibraltars in Moab. Another rendering (Ewald, Keil) is, "(to) the third Eglath." This involves an allusion to the fact that there were other places in Moab called Egiath or Eglah, which has been rendered highly probable by Gesenius. <span class="cmt_word">The waters also of Nimrhn.</span> Canon Tristram speaks of the "plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills into the Ghor-en-Numeira." Consul Wetzstein, however, says that nature appears there under so unspeakably gloomy an aspect, that the identification is impossible. He proposes a site in the Wady So'eb, about fourteen miles east of the Jordan, which with its luxuriant meadows, covered with the flocks of the Bedouin, is probably suitable to the passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah (Excursus it. in Delitzsch's 'Jesaja,' 4th edit., pp. 572, 573). So also Seetzen, who remarks that the lower part of this wady is still called Nahr Nimrin. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> a place called Beth - nimrah is mentioned as situated in the valley (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jordan valley); no doubt this was in the wady referred to by the prophets. "The valley" seems to have been sometimes used in a wider signification, so as to include lateral valleys like that of Nimrim. The antiquity of the name is shown by its occurrence in the Annals of Thothmos III., who penetrated into the heart of Palestine, and, in the temple of Karnak, enumerates the cities which he conquered. From before <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span> to nearly A.D. this secluded valley has borne precisely the same name! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
