Wine not so treated retained its first crude bitterness. So, the prophet says, it is with nations. It is not good for them to remain too long in a prosperity which does but strengthen their natural arrogance. There is a wholesome discipline in defeat, even in exile. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm" title="Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a> we have the hope of the prophet that the discipline will do its work. The "vessels" and "bottles" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-12.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will send to him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.">Jeremiah 48:12</a> are, of course, the cities and villages of Moab. (Comp. the imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moab hath been at ease from his youth</span>. The "youth" of Moab dates from its subjugation of the aboriginal Emim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>)' Since that event, though often at war, sometimes tributary and sometimes expelled from a part of the territory claimed by them (see the inscription on the Moabite Stone), yet they had never been disturbed in their ancestral homes to the south of the river Amen. <span class="cmt_word">He hath settled on his less.</span> It was the custom to leave wine for a time on its lees or sediment, in order to heighten its strength and flavour (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Emptied from vessel to vessel.</span> Thevenot, an old traveller in Persia, remarks of the Shiraz wine that, after it is separated from the lees, it is apt to grow sour. "The wine is put into large earthen jars, each holding from ten or twelve to fourteen <span class="accented">carabas</span>; but when a jar has been opened, it must be emptied as soon as possible, and the wine put into bottles or <span class="accented">carabas</span>, otherwise it spoils and becomes sour" ('Voyages,' 2:245, quoted by Lowth on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). In the application of the figure, the "taste" of Moab means obviously the national character. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.</body></html>
