<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-6.htm" title="We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.">Isaiah 16:6</a>). Heshbon (the city is perhaps chosen on account of the similarity of sound with the word for "devise ") was on the Ammonite or northern frontier of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>), and is represented therefore as the scene of the plans and hopes of the invading Chaldaeans. The site of Madmen is unknown, but the cognate form Madmenah is translated "dunghill" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a>, and may have been chosen by each prophet on account of its ignominious meaning. The name appears as belonging to a town in Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-31.htm" title="Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.">Isaiah 10:31</a>) and in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-31.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,">Joshua 15:31</a>). Here again there is an obvious assonance or paronomasia, the verb "thou shalt be cut down," or better, <span class= "ital">thou shalt be brought to silence, </span>reproducing the chief consonants of the noun. The LXX., Vulgate, and Syriac, indeed, take the words with this meaning, "In silence thou shalt be made silent," but are probably wrong in doing so. If we take the word in somewhat of the same sense as in Isaiah, the words may point to the place being filled with the mouldering carcases of the silent dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - There shall be <span class="cmt_word">no more praise of Moab;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Moab's glory</span> (or, <span class="accented">glorying</span>) <span class="accented">is no more</span> (comp. ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">In Heshbon they have devised evil</span>, etc. There is a word play in the Hebrew, which may be reproduced thus: "In Plot-house they plot evil against it" (so J. F. Smith's Ewald). <span class="cmt_word">Against it</span> (literally, <span class="accented">her</span>) means "against Moab." Heshbon was at the time an Ammonitish town (it had in days gone by been Amoritish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>; but was on the border of Moab. <span class="cmt_word">O Madmen.</span> There seems to be again a word play, which has been to some extent reproduced thus: "Thou shalt become still, O Still house." The name Madmen does not occur again, though an allusion to it has been fancied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>, where the Hebrew for "dunghill" is <span class="accented">madmenah.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.</body></html>
