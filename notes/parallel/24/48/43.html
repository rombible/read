The sequence in each case shows that each word plays a distinct part in the imagery. First there is the terror of the animal pursued by huntsmen, then the pit dug in the earth that it may fall into it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm" title="He made a pit, and dig it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm" title="Whoever digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return on him.">Proverbs 26:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm" title="He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoever breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>); then, if it scrambles out of the pit, the snare or trap which finally secures it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43-47.</span> - Hence, as the final result, escape is absolutely impossible, for one can get succeeds another in an endless series The last and greatest danger besots those who seek refuge behind the strong fortifications of Heshbon, It is from this very city that the hottest fire of the enemy breaks forth. Chemosh has not saved his people; and yet there is hope for Moab in the future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fear, and the pit, and the snare.</span> An alliteration in the Hebrew, which occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>. In German it can be represented better than in English - <span class="accented">e.g.</span> by Hitzig's "grauen, graben, garn." All primitive poetry delights in such alliterations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
