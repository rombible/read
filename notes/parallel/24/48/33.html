and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.">Isaiah 16:10</a>). Of this the prophet says, in a form which reminds us of the <span class= "greekheb">???? ????? </span>("gifts that are no gifts") of Soph. Aias. 674, that it shall be "no shouting," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> that it shall be turned to wailing and lamentation, or the shout and tumult of battle shall have taken its place.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - Nearly identical with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The plentiful field;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the garden land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> land planted with "noble" plants, especially vines and olives. <span class="cmt_word">Wine</span>. Here clearly sweet and unfermented wine (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">None shall tread with shouting.</span> This involves a very harsh construction of the Hebrew, and it is better (considering the numerous other errors of the same kind in the received text) to correct in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>," the treader shall not tread." Their <span class="cmt_word">shouting</span> shall be <span class="cmt_word">no shouting.</span> "Shouting" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">hedad</span>) may be taken in two senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the cheerful, musical cry with which "the treaders" pressed out the juice of the grapes (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wild cry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>) with which the enemy "fell upon the summer fruits and upon the vintage" (ver. 32), reducing the inhabitants to abject misery. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9, 10</a> an allusion is made to this double meaning, and so, perhaps, it may be here ("There shall be shouting, but not that of the peaceful vintagers at their work"). Or, as others, we may explain "no shouting" as equivalent to "the opposite of shouting," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either silence or lamentation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>, "not wood" equivalent to "that which is specifically different from wood;" and Isaiah 31:3, "not God," equivalent to "the very opposite of Divine"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.</body></html>
