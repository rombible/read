In "I have promised" we may indeed trace a distinct reference to that passage. Once more "the Branch of righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>)--the coming heir of the throne of David, the true King who is to execute judgment--is put forward, as seen in the vision of the prophet's hopes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-26.</span> - These verses are omitted in the Septuagint, and some leading critics think that both the style and the contents point to a different author from our prophet. In particular it is urged that the promise of a multitude of Levites and of descendants of David is isolated among the prophecies of Jeremiah, who elsewhere speaks of a single great representative of David as the object of pious hope, and of the intercourse between Jehovah and his people as being closer and more immediate than under the old Law. A variation in the form of expressing the Messianic hope is, however, not of much importance. Isaiah, for instance, sometimes refers to a single ideal king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, etc.); sometimes to a succession of noble, God-fearing kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That good thing which I have promised;</span> viz. in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a> (which see). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.</body></html>
