Then it had been given when the line of David was in all the freshness of its strength. Now it is uttered when that line seemed on the very point of dying out. The hope of the prophet is, however, inextinguishable. He is certain that the true King will always be of the house of David. It lay almost in the nature of the case that the words of the prophet should find a fulfilment other than that which was present to his thoughts; and that, while he pictured to himself an unbroken succession of sovereigns of David's line, there was in fact a higher fulfilment in the continuous sovereignty of the Christ as the true Son of David. We have something like an echo of the words in the words of the Angel at the Annunciation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32-33</a>), and it is an echo that interprets them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David shall never want a man,</span> etc. This is, in fact, a republication of the promise given by Nathan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. It agrees in form with the announcements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.</body></html>
