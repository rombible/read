The "swords" (the word is translated by "axes" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-9.htm" title="And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.">Ezekiel 26:9</a>) include tools used for breaking down walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - The houses of Jerusalem, destroyed by the engines of the besiegers or filled with dead bodies, shall be restored; the captives shall be brought back; their sins shall be forgiven, and God be glorified. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the mounts, and by the sword;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because of the mounds</span> (see on Jeremiah 32:24) <span class="accented">and because of the weapons of war.</span> The latter are the warlike instruments used by the besiegers from their batteries or breastworks. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-13 Those who expect to receive comforts from God, must call upon him. Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.</body></html>
