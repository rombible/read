The phrase was a familiar one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-6.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 53:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm" title="That then the LORD your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations, where the LORD your God has scattered you.">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>. The words "as at the first" (literally, <span class= "ital">as at the beginning</span>) do not refer to any previous restoration, like that of the Exodus from Egypt, but to the state before the exile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sacrifice of praise</span> (see on Jeremiah 17:26). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-13 Those who expect to receive comforts from God, must call upon him. Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.</body></html>
