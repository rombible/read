whereas the LORD was there:">Ezekiel 35:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm" title="And when they entered to the heathen, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. The words "this people," however, used as they are invariably of that to which the prophet himself belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm" title="But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.">Jeremiah 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a>, and elsewhere), and indeed in the hundred or more passages in which the phrase occurs in the Old Testament, lead to a different conclusion. The prophet's declaration of the steadfastness of God's covenant was made in answer, not to the taunts of the heathen, but to the despair of Israel, such as had found utterance in the words recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,">Jeremiah 33:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-43.htm" title="And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 32:43</a>. If the words "thus they have despised my people" seem to favour the former interpretation, it must be remembered that the subject of the verb is not necessarily the same as that of the previous clause, and that the scorn of other nations would be the natural outcome of the despondency into which Israel had fallen; or they might emphasise the fact that the despondency was itself, as it were, suicidal. Those who despised their own nation were despising the people of Jehovah. In contrast with this despondency, the prophet renews his assurance of the permanence of the kingly and priestly lines, and strengthens it by reference to the three great patriarchs of the race, with whom the truth of Jehovah's promises was identified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm" title="And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.">Exodus 3:15</a>), and by connecting it with the promise of a return from the captivity. When that return came, it would be the pledge and earnest of the yet greater blessings which were involved in the new and everlasting covenant.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This people;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not Egyptians or Babylonians (as some have supposed), but the people of Judah, regarded as alienated from Jehovah (hence the touch of disparagement), as elsewhere in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>, etc.).

He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.</body></html>
