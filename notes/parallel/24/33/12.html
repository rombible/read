Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,">Jeremiah 33:10</a>, "the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem." The "habitation" for shepherds is translated sometimes by "sheepcote" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-7.htm" title="Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that you should be ruler over my people Israel:">1Chronicles 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm" title="Now therefore so shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:">2Samuel 7:8</a>), sometimes by "fold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-10.htm" title="And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.">Isaiah 65:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-14.htm" title="I will feed them in a good pasture, and on the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel.">Ezekiel 34:14</a>), sometimes by "dwelling" or "habitation." It would seem here to answer to the "towns" of our old English speech, as meaning enclosed spaces, with the tower of the watchman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-9.htm" title="And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.">2Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>), in which, in times of average tranquillity, shepherds and their flocks found shelter, but which were abandoned when the land was overrun by an invading army. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-13.htm" title="In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that tells them, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:13</a> the eye of the prophet travels over such districts within the kingdom of Judah to the north and south of Jerusalem, and adds to the picture the vivid touch that the "sheep shall pass under the hands of him that telleth them," the shepherd whose work it was to count the flock--in older English, "to tell his tale"--as it went out in the morning and returned at nightfall, should find that he had lost none of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An habitation;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a pasture</span> (including the idea of an encampment). The expression reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3, 4</a>, but it is preferable to take the present passage in its literal sense rather than as metaphorical. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-13 Those who expect to receive comforts from God, must call upon him. Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.</body></html>
