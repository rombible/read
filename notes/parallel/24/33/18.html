It was burnt with fire on the altar, and the fragrant smoke was a "sweet savour unto the Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the priests the Levites,</span> etc. It has Been thought that this passage is inconsistent with the prophecies of a time when the ark should no more be remembered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>), and when all should know Jehovah from the least to the greatest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>). But though sin offerings would in this glorious time become things of the past, yet thank offerings are expressly excepted from abolition (ver. 11), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a> a special latter-day promise is given to the priests. Moreover, Ezekiel, who repeats the prophecy of the new spiritual covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a>), gives an elaborate sketch of a new temple with a sacrificial system (ch. 40, etc.); and, if there is any inconsistency, we find the same one in the latter part of Isaiah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a> the whole regenerate people of Israel is called "the priests of Jehovah;" but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-21.htm">Isaiah 66:21</a> the prophet distinctly states that there will be, in some sense, a priestly class within the chosen people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.</body></html>
