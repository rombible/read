The law which Jeremiah received as given by God laid down no such rule of life. A righteous life was possible without it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm" title="Shall you reign, because you close yourself in cedar? did not your father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?">Jeremiah 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>). What he was taught to praise was the steadfastness and loyalty with which they adhered to a merely human precept, not at variance with the letter of any divine law, and designed, like the Nazarite vow, to carry the spirit of that law--the idea of a life-long consecration--to its highest point. The temper of faithfulness to any rule of life sanctioned by prescription, whether it be that of a school, a college, a guild, or a religious order, is in itself praiseworthy as compared with that of individual self-assertion and self-will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - A promise to the Rechabites (perhaps removed from its original connection). The form of the promise is remarkable; it runs, <span class="cmt_word">Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever.</span> The phrase is, as Dr. Plumptre remarks, "all but essentially liturgical. It is used of the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5, 7</a>), of the worship of the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>), of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-11.htm">2 Chronicles 29:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-65.htm">Nehemiah 7:65</a>), of prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-15.htm">1 Kings 18:15</a>), of priests and Levites together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-2.htm">Psalm 135:2</a>)." It is, however, rash, perhaps, to maintain, with the same acute scholar, that the Rechabites were adopted into the tribe of Levi. The phrase may be simply chosen to indicate the singular favour with which Jehovah regarded the Rechabites - a favour only to be compared to that accorded to his most honoured servants among the Israelites - the patriarchs, the priests, and the prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:12-19 The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was for a sign; it made the disobedience of the Jews to God the more marked. The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, and Jonadab never did for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercy is promised to the Rechabites. We are not told respecting the performance of this promise; but doubtless it was performed, and travellers say the Rechabites may be found a separate people to this day. Let us follow the counsels of our pious forefathers, and we shall find good in so doing.</body></html>
