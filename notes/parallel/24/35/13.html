The words of Jonadab had been kept faithfully as a rule of life for 300 years by his descendants or his order. The words of Jehovah, "rising early and speaking" through His prophets (we note the repetition of the characteristic phrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm" title="And now, because you have done all these works, said the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you heard not; and I called you, but you answered not;">Jeremiah 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm" title="From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but you have not listened.">Jeremiah 25:3</a>), were neglected by the people whom He had adopted as His children.

The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, and Jonadab never did for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercy is promised to the Rechabites. We are not told respecting the performance of this promise; but doubtless it was performed, and travellers say the Rechabites may be found a separate people to this day. Let us follow the counsels of our pious forefathers, and we shall find good in so doing.</body></html>
