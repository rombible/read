The Jewish historian Hegesippus (see Euseb. <span class= "ital">Hist. Eccl. </span>ii. 23), in his account of the martyrdom of James the Just, names the sons of the Rechabites as looking on in reverential sympathy with one whose life, like their own, carried the Nazarite type to its highest perfection. In the account which Diodorus Siculns (xix. 94) gives of the Nabathaeans as neither sowing seed, nor planting fruit-trees, nor building houses, and enforcing this rule of life under pain of death, we can scarcely fail to recognise the Rechabite type. Benjamin of Tudela, in the twelfth century, reports that he found 100,000 Jews who were named Rechabites, and who lived after their fashion near <span class= "ital">El Jubar, </span>and that they were governed by a prince of the house of David. More recent travellers, Dr. Wolff (<span class= "ital">Journal, </span>1829, ii. 334; 1839, <span class= "ital">p. </span>389) and Signor Pierotti (<span class= "ital">Transactions of British Association, </span>1862), report that they have met tribes near Mecca, on the Dead Sea, or in Yemen and Senaar, who observed the rule of Jonadab, claimed to be his descendants, referred to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a> as fulfilled in them, and led the life of devout Jews. It is probable, however, that in these later instances we may trace the effect of the Wahabee ascetic movement among the Mahomedan Arabs, identifying its rule with the old practice of the son of Rechab (Burckhardt: <span class= "ital">Bedouins and Wahabys, </span>p. 283).<p>The words "stand before" have, however, in Hebrew a distinct secondary meaning. It was a definitely liturgical expression for the ministrations of the Levites who were chosen to "stand before" the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-5.htm" title="For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.">Deuteronomy 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-7.htm" title="Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>), and a like meaning is prominent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-10.htm" title="And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?">Jeremiah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD, If you return, then will I bring you again, and you shall stand before me: and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: let them return to you; but return not you to them.">Jeremiah 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-22.htm" title="And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.">Genesis 18:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm" title="And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm" title="Behold, bless you the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.">Psalm 134:1</a>. The Targum of this passage, indeed, actually gives "ministering before me" as its paraphrase. The natural inference would be that the Rechabites were by these words admitted, in virtue of their Nazarite character, to serve as Levites in the Temple--to be, in fact, a higher class of Nethinim (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm" title="Now the first inhabitants that dwelled in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.">1Chronicles 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-43.htm" title="The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,">Ezra 2:43</a>)--and this view is confirmed (1) by the fact that the LXX. ascribes Psalms 71 to "the sons of Jonadab, the first that were led captive;<span class= "ital">" </span>(2) that a son of Rechab is associated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-14.htm" title="But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:14</a> with priests and Levites and nobles in repairing the walls of Jerusalem; (3) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.">1Chronicles 2:55</a> the Rechabites have become scribes, and in the Vulgate (evidence of a Jewish tradition as to the meaning of the words), the proper names of the English version, "Tirathites, Shimeathites, and Sucathites," which add nothing to our knowledge, are represented by "c<span class= "ital">anentes et resonantes et in tabernaculis commorantes" </span>("singing, and playing instruments, and dwelling in tents"), which unite the functions of Levites with the mode of life of the Rechabites. So Hegesippus (as above) speaks of priests who were of the sons of Rechab in the Apostolic age.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:12-19 The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was for a sign; it made the disobedience of the Jews to God the more marked. The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, and Jonadab never did for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercy is promised to the Rechabites. We are not told respecting the performance of this promise; but doubtless it was performed, and travellers say the Rechabites may be found a separate people to this day. Let us follow the counsels of our pious forefathers, and we shall find good in so doing.</body></html>
