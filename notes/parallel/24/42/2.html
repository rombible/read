The people now turn to him, acknowledging him as a true prophet, and, trusting to his patriotism. ask for his guidance. Their position was difficult and dangerous.

He complies with their wishes, and they, on their side, promise to follow the guidance for which they ask.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Said unto Jeromiah the prophet.</span> Jeremiah, we have been already told, was one of the refugees at Mizpah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-6.htm">Jeremiah 40:6</a>), and consequently was forced into the train of Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Pray for us</span>. This petition has been accused of hypocrisy, but the prophecy of Jeremiah assumes throughout that it was made in earnest (ver. 20 proven nothing to the contrary). The "captains" never supposed it possible that Jeremiah could direct them to stay in Judah; the only question with them was as to the best direction for flight. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-6 To serve a turn, Jeremiah is sought out, and the captains ask for his assistance. In every difficult, doubtful case, we must look to God for direction; and we may still, in faith, pray to be guided by a spirit of wisdom in our hearts, and the leadings of Providence. We do not truly desire to know the mind of God, if we do not fully resolve to comply with it when we know it. Many promise to do what the Lord requires, while they hope to have their pride flattered, and their favourite lusts spared. Yet something betrays the state of their hearts.</body></html>
