There was something like a "rush" from many nations--Moab, Edom, and others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a>)--of fugitives, looking to Egypt as their one hope of safety against the Chaldaeans, and joining with the Jews that had sought shelter in their respective territories (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm" title="Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). We note in the prophet's warning the recurrence of the old familiar phrases, "by the sword, by the famine, by the pestilence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-10.htm" title="And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.">Jeremiah 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Smite with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.">Ezekiel 6:11</a>), of an "execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm" title="And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.">Jeremiah 24:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm" title="Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.">Jeremiah 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm" title="And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them:">Jeremiah 29:18</a>). They would involve themselves by rejecting his counsels in all the worst evils that he had prophesied before. What had been addressed to the mixed multitude is emphatically repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-19.htm" title="The LORD has said concerning you, O you remnant of Judah; Go you not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.">Jeremiah 42:19</a> to the "remnant of Judah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:7-22 If we would know the mind of the Lord in doubtful cases, we must wait as well as pray. God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.</body></html>
