As of old, it was still the granary of the East, and its plenteous harvests formed a bright contrast to the famine which they had experienced during the invasion of the Chaldaeans. Jeremiah, however, has simply to reject the plan, as from first to last he had resisted altogether the thought of an Egyptian alliance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-36.htm" title="Why gad you about so much to change your way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.">Jeremiah 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-7.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall you say to the king of Judah, that sent you to me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.">Jeremiah 37:7</a>): there would be no safety nor peace nor plenty found in acting on it. Ezekiel's prophecies as to Egypt and her king were in this respect in harmony with Jeremiah's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 17:11-18</a>; Ezekiel 29-32), and were, as nearly as possible, contemporary with them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:7-22 If we would know the mind of the Lord in doubtful cases, we must wait as well as pray. God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.</body></html>
