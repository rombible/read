So Ezekiel waited for seven days among the exiles that dwelt by the river of Chebar, till the word of the Lord came to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-16.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 3:16</a>). When the hour came, the prophet preached to a multitude whose eagerness to hear him had been intensified by the suspense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After ten days.</span> Why this delay? Keil thinks it was for the sake of the people, who needed time to collect themselves and listen calmly to the revelation. Ezekiel once waited seven days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>); but this was owing to his own disturbed state of mind. The answer of the Lord extends to ver. 18, the last four verses being an epilogue enforcing the Divine declaration. It consists of the promise (vers. 9-12) that, if the people will remain quietly in the land, they will be protected; and of the threat (vers. 13-18) that, if they presume to migrate into Egypt, they will perish there by sword, famine, and pestilence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:7-22 If we would know the mind of the Lord in doubtful cases, we must wait as well as pray. God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.</body></html>
