Both, as occupying the sea-board of Palestine, were to suffer from Nebuchadnezzar's invasion. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7</a> indicates that they were not unfrequently in alliance. In the "helper that remaineth" we have probably a reference to the foreign mercenaries, especially the Philistines, employed by the two great commercial cities. "Caphtor" has been identified with Crete, Cyprus, Caria, Cappadocia, and the delta of the Nile. On the latter view the name is held to be connected with <span class= "ital">Coptic. </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a> points to a migration of the people known as Philistines from that region, and there is accordingly a touch of scorn in the way in which Jeremiah speaks of them as the mere "remnant of Caphtor." In agreement with the first view we find among David's mercenaries the Cherethim and Pelethim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2Samuel 8:18</a>), the two names being probably modifications of Cretans and Philistines. The ethnological table of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm" title="And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.">Genesis 10:14</a> connects both the Philistines and the Caphtorim with Mizraim or Egypt, and is, so far as it goes, in favour of the Egyptian identification.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The day that cometh;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the day that hath come</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall have come). It is "the day of the Lord" that is meant, that revolutionary "shaking of all things" (to use Haggai's expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-21.htm">Haggai 2:21</a>), as to which see further in note on Jeremiah 46:10. <span class="cmt_word">To cut off... every helper that remaineth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every ally on whom they could still reckon. This passage favours the view that the judgment upon the Philistines took place at the same time as that upon Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar's object was to isolate Tyre and Sidon as completely as possible. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant.</span> The Philistines had suffered so much from repeated invasions as to be only a "remnant" of the once powerful nation which oppressed Israel (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">The country of Caphtor.</span> Some would render "the coastland of Caphtor," but the idea of "coast" seems to be a secondary one, derived in certain passages from the context. Properly speaking, it is a poetic synonym for "land," and is generally applied to distant and (accidentally) maritime countries. "Caphtor" was understood by the old versions to be Cappadocia. But as the remains of the Cappadocian language point to a Persian origin of the population which spoke it, and as the Caphtorim originally came from Egypt, it is more plausible to suppose, with Ebers, that Caphtor was a coast district of North Egypt. Crete has also been thought of (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-7 The calamities of the Philistines. - The Philistines had always been enemies to Israel; but the Chaldean army shall overflow their land like a deluge. Those whom God will spoil, must be spoiled. For when the Lord intends to destroy the wicked, he will cut off every helper. So deplorable are the desolations of war, that the blessings of peace are most desirable. But we must submit to His appointments who ordains all in perfect wisdom and justice.</body></html>
