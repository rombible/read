In the present passage, the Hebrew word means something more definite than that in Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>; it is the "crashing" of an earthquake, or (as here) the "rattling" of chariots. <span class="cmt_word">The rumbling of his wheels.</span> "Rumbling" is a happy equivalent. The Hebrew (<span class="accented">hamon</span>) is the word referred to in the preceding note as meaning an indefinite confused sound. <span class="cmt_word">The fathers shall not look back to their children,</span> etc. An awful picture, and still more effective in the concise language of the original. The Hebrew Scriptures excel (as still more strikingly, but with too great a want of moderation, does the Koran) in the sublime of terror. So overpowering shall the panic be that fathers will not even turn an eye to their helpless children. Observe, it is said "the fathers," not "the mothers." The picture is poetically finer than that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56, 57</a>, because the shade of colouring is a degree softer. <span class="cmt_word">Feebleness of hands.</span> A common expression for the enervation produced by extreme terror (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-7 The calamities of the Philistines. - The Philistines had always been enemies to Israel; but the Chaldean army shall overflow their land like a deluge. Those whom God will spoil, must be spoiled. For when the Lord intends to destroy the wicked, he will cut off every helper. So deplorable are the desolations of war, that the blessings of peace are most desirable. But we must submit to His appointments who ordains all in perfect wisdom and justice.</body></html>
