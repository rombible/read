The first "habitation" is the dwelling-place of Jehovah, from which the thunders of His wrath are heard. The second is the <span class= "ital">"pasture" </span>or dwelling-place of the flock and its shepherds, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-2.htm" title="I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.">Jeremiah 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm" title="Pour out your fury on the heathen that know you not, and on the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.">Jeremiah 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-7.htm" title="For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.">Psalm 79:7</a>, upon whom the storm falls. Possibly, under its association with this new word, the roaring becomes to the prophet's mind as that of the lion which attacks the flock. The same bold imagery for the Divine judgments meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-16.htm" title="The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.">Joel 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm" title="The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy?">Amos 3:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">A shout, as they that tread the grapes.</span>--The image is reproduced from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm" title="I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.">Isaiah 63:3</a>. The "shout" of those who tread the wine-press, crushing the grapes beneath their feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm" title="And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.">Isaiah 16:10</a>), is as the victorious war-cry of the Lord of Hosts, working through human conquerors, and crushing the nations of the earth in His avenging wrath.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-38.</span> - The judgment upon the world. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore prophesy thou</span>, etc. Babylon, like the smaller kingdoms which it absorbed, has fallen, and nothing remains (for nothing had been revealed to the prophet concerning an interval to elapse previously) but to picture the great assize from which no flesh should be exempt. As the lion suddenly bursts, roaring, from his lair, so Jehovah, no longer the "good Shepherd," <span class="cmt_word">shall roar from on high</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>) even <span class="cmt_word">upon his habitation</span>, or rather, <span class="accented">against his pasture</span>, where his flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>) has been feeding so securely. <span class="cmt_word">He shall give a shout</span>. It is the technical term used at once for the vintage-shout and for the battle-cry. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9, 10</a>, there is a beautiful allusion to this double meaning, and so perhaps there is here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:30-38 The Lord has just ground of controversy with every nation and every person; and he will execute judgment on all the wicked. Who can avoid trembling when God speaks in displeasure? The days are fully come; the time fixed in the Divine counsels, which will make the nations wholly desolate. The tender and delicate shall share the common calamity. Even those who used to live in peace, and did nothing to provoke, shall not escape. Blessed be God, there is a peaceable habitation above, for all the sons of peace. The Lord will preserve his church and all believers in all changes; for nothing can separate them from his love.</body></html>
