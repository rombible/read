The imagery is one familiar in earlier prophets. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-22.htm" title="Thus said your Lord the LORD, and your God that pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you shall no more drink it again:">Isaiah 51:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm" title="You are filled with shame for glory: drink you also, and let your foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned to you, and shameful spewing shall be on your glory.">Habakkuk 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm" title="That your beloved may be delivered; save with your right hand, and hear me.">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-31.htm" title="You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.">Ezekiel 23:31</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be moved, and be mad</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and reel to and fro</span>, <span class="accented">and behave themselves madly</span>. The inspired writers do not scruple to ascribe all phenomena, the "bad" as well as the "good," to a Divine operation. "Shall there be evil in a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). "An evil spirit from Elohim came upon Saul, and he became frenzied" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>, and especially the very remarkable prologue of the Book of Job). To understand this form of expression, we must remember the strength of the reaction experienced by the prophets against the polytheism of the surrounding nations. It was not open to them to account for the existence of evil by ascribing it to the activity of various divinities; they knew Jehovah to be the sole cause in the universe. To us, "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought," such a doctrine occasions "great searchings of heart," and is sometimes a sore trial of our faith. But the prophets were not logicians, and their faith, compared to ours, was as an oak tree to a sapling; hence they can generally (see, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>) express the truth of the universal causation of Jehovah with perfect tranquility. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the sword</span>. Here Jeremiah deserts the figure of the Cup, and, as most commentators think, uses the language of fact. It is not, however, certain that "the sword" means that of God's human instruments; Jehovah himself has a sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>; and elsewhere), just as he has a hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a>) and an arm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>). All these belong to a group of childlike symbolic expressions for the manifestation of the Deity. Jehovah's "sword" is described more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; it "turns hither and thither," like the lightning - a striking figure of the completeness with which God performs his work of vengeance (see also on ver. 27). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:15-29 The evil and the good events of life are often represented in Scripture as cups. Under this figure is represented the desolation then coming upon that part of the world, of which Nebuchadnezzar, who had just began to reign and act, was to be the instrument; but this destroying sword would come from the hand of God. The desolations the sword should make in all these kingdoms, are represented by the consequences of excessive drinking. This may make us loathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of it are used to set forth such a woful condition. Drunkenness deprives men of the use of their reason, makes men as mad. It takes from them the valuable blessing, health; and is a sin which is its own punishment. This may also make us dread the judgments of war. It soon fills a nation with confusion. They will refuse to take the cup at thy hand. They will not believe Jeremiah; but he must tell them it is the word of the Lord of hosts, and it is in vain for them to struggle against Almighty power. And if God's judgments begin with backsliding professors, let not the wicked expect to escape.</body></html>
