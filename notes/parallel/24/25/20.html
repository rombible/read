Here the word probably refers to the Ionians or Carians whom Psammitichus, the father of Nechoh, had settled at Bubastis, and who served in his army as auxiliaries. (Herod. ii. 152, 154.)<p><span class= "bld">Uz.</span>--A district of Edom, famous as the scene of the great drama of the book of Job.

"Gath," which appears in the older lists of the five lords of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm" title="They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.">1Samuel 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;">1Samuel 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-14.htm" title="And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.">1Samuel 7:14</a>), has disappeared, having possibly seceded from the confederacy. The "remnant of Ashdod" (the Greek Azotus) is a phrase characteristic of the prophet's time, the Egyptian king Psammitichus having captured it, after a siege of twenty-nine years, in B.C. 630. (Herod. ii. 157.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mingled people</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">V</span>ulgate, <span class="accented">et universes generaliter</span>. The Hebrew '<span class="accented">erebh</span> probably means, not "mingled [i.e. 'motley'] people," as the Authorized Version, but "foreign people," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a body of men belonging to some particular nation <span class="accented">intermixed</span> or interspersed among those belonging to another. This explanation will account for the use of the word in all the passages in which it occurs (here and in ver. 24; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:37; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-14.htm">2 Chronicles 9:14</a>). The context here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> seems to imply that the name was given especially to the tribes (probably Bedawin tribes) on the frontier of Judah towards the desert, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> it is evidently applied to a people which in some sense belonged to Egypt. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a> it may be doubted whether the phrase is used from the point of view of Egypt or of the Israelites; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a> it is used of the foreigners in Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-14.htm">2 Chronicles 9:14</a> the Massoretic critics have pointed the consonants of the text wrongly ('<span class="accented">arabh</span>, Arabia, instead of '<span class="accented">erebh</span>), but without injury to the sense; the Vulgate and Syriac have done the same in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>. The notion that the word means ' auxiliary troops" arises (as Thenius on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> remarks) from the free rendering of the Targum at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Uz</span>. The land associated with the name of Job, and probably east or south-east of Palestine, and adjacent to the Edomites of Mount Seir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the Philistines</span>. Observe, Gath is alone omitted of the five Philistine towns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a>). It had been reduced to complete insignificance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>), through Uzziah's having "broken down" its walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), and is equally passed over in Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a>), Zephaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>), and Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Azzah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Gaza, the Septuagint form (the G representing the initial <span class="accented">ayin</span>), which is everywhere else adopted by the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Ashdod</span>. A significant phrase, which can be explained from Herodotus (2:157): For twenty-nine years Psamnutichus "pressed the siege of Azotus without intermission." We can imagine that he would not be disposed to lenient dealings with the town upon its capture. (An earlier and shorter siege of Ashdod is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20.htm">Isaiah 20</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:15-29 The evil and the good events of life are often represented in Scripture as cups. Under this figure is represented the desolation then coming upon that part of the world, of which Nebuchadnezzar, who had just began to reign and act, was to be the instrument; but this destroying sword would come from the hand of God. The desolations the sword should make in all these kingdoms, are represented by the consequences of excessive drinking. This may make us loathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of it are used to set forth such a woful condition. Drunkenness deprives men of the use of their reason, makes men as mad. It takes from them the valuable blessing, health; and is a sin which is its own punishment. This may also make us dread the judgments of war. It soon fills a nation with confusion. They will refuse to take the cup at thy hand. They will not believe Jeremiah; but he must tell them it is the word of the Lord of hosts, and it is in vain for them to struggle against Almighty power. And if God's judgments begin with backsliding professors, let not the wicked expect to escape.</body></html>
