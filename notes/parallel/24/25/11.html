The seventy years are commonly reckoned from B.C. 606, the date of the deportation of Jehoiakim and his princes, to B.C. 536, when the decree for the return of the exiles was issued by Cyrus. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2Chronicles 36:21</a> the number is connected with the land "enjoying her Sabbaths," as though the long desolation came as a retribution for the people's neglect of the law of the Sabbatical year, and, perhaps, also for their non-observance of the weekly Sabbaths. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/17-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 17:21-22</a>.) For the apportionment of the reigns of the Babylonian kings that made up the seventy years, see the <span class= "ital">Chronological Table </span>in the <span class= "ital">Introduction. </span>Symbolically the number, as the multiple of seven and ten, represents the highest measure of completeness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-22.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I say not to you, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.">Matthew 18:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years</span>. Widely different opinions are held as to the meaning of this prophecy. The most probable view is that "seventy" is an indefinite or round number (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>), equivalent to "a very long time." This is supported by the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>, where the captivity is announced as lasting through the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar, his son, and his grandson - a statement evidently vague and indefinite (see <span class="accented">ad</span> loc.), and in any case not answering to a period of seventy years. Besides, we find the "seventy years" again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, a passage written probably eleven years later. Others think the number is to be taken literally, and it is certainly true that from <span class="date">B.C. 606</span>, the fourth year of Jehoiakim, to the fall of Babylon, <span class="date">B.C. 539</span>, sixty-seven years elapsed. But is it desirable to press this against the internal evidence that Jeremiah himself took the number indefinitely? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-14 The fixing of the time during which the Jewish captivity should last, would not only confirm the prophecy, but also comfort the people of God, and encourage faith and prayer. The ruin of Babylon is foretold: the rod will be thrown into the fire when the correcting work is done. When the set time to favour Zion is come, Babylon shall be punished for their iniquity, as other nations have been punished for their sins. Every threatening of the Scripture will certainly be accomplished.</body></html>
