a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts musters the host of the battle.">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm" title="Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!">Isaiah 17:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A controversy.</span>--The term properly denotes a legal process, like the "pleading" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-9.htm" title="Why I will yet plead with you, said the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.">Jeremiah 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-35.htm" title="Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.">Jeremiah 2:35</a>, rather than a debate or discussion, and is therefore rightly followed by the technical term "will plead" or "judge." Jehovah appears, so to speak, as the Accuser in the suit in which He is also the supreme Judge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A noise</span>. The word is used elsewhere for the tumultuous sound of a marching army (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will plead</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he will hold judgment</span>. Jehovah's "contending" sometimes involves the notion of punishing, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>. In 2 Chronicles 22:8, the same verb in the same conjugation is forcibly rendered in the Authorized Version, "to execute judgment." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:30-38 The Lord has just ground of controversy with every nation and every person; and he will execute judgment on all the wicked. Who can avoid trembling when God speaks in displeasure? The days are fully come; the time fixed in the Divine counsels, which will make the nations wholly desolate. The tender and delicate shall share the common calamity. Even those who used to live in peace, and did nothing to provoke, shall not escape. Blessed be God, there is a peaceable habitation above, for all the sons of peace. The Lord will preserve his church and all believers in all changes; for nothing can separate them from his love.</body></html>
