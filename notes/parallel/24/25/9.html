It has its parallel, and, in fact, its explanation, in the language in which Isaiah speaks of Cyrus as the shepherd, the anointed, of Jehovah. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>) Each ruler of the great empires of the world was, in ways he knew not, working out the purposes of God. The phrase "I will utterly destroy" may be noted as specially characteristic of Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm" title="And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:">Deuteronomy 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-6.htm" title="And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.">Deuteronomy 3:6</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) and Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-10.htm" title="For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.">Joshua 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-21.htm" title="And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-26.htm" title="For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.">Joshua 8:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The families of the north</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant.</span> This is the rendering of the Targum, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, and corresponds with the reading of a few extant manuscripts. The received text, however, reads, "and unto Nebuchadnezzar," etc. Neither reading is satisfactory. The latter one is intolerably harsh; the former makes Nebuchadnezzar a mere adjunct of the tribes of the north. In the other passages, moreover, where this king is solemnly entitled "my servant," the clause is the most prominent one in the sentence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>). The words in question have a sort of family resemblance to the glosses which meet us occasionally both in the form of the Hebrew text represented by the Massoretic recension, and those by the principal ancient versions. The words are omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">My servant</span>. Generally to be a "servant" of Jehovah or of any supposed deity is to be a worshipper. Thus Daniel is called by Darius, "servant of the living God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>), and thus Abdallah, "servant of Allah," has become a favorite surname of the followers of Mohammed. In the Book of Jeremiah itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>), and in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), "my servant" is the form in which Jehovah addresses his chosen people; and in the second part of Isaiah the suffering Messiah is so styled. Here, however, a foreign king is thus entitled. How is this to be explained? Cyrus, no doubt, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, 45:1, is called "my shepherd" and "my anointed one;" but then Cyrus, in the view of the prophet, was a genuine though unconscious worshipper of the true God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>), whereas Nebuchadnezzar was known to be a polytheist and an idolater. We must, therefore, take "servant" to be applied to Nebuchadnezzar in a lower sense than to the other bearers of the title. The Hebrew 'ebbed, in fact, may be either "slave" in something approaching to the terrible modern sense, or in the sense in which Eliezer was one (i.e. little less than a son, and a possible heir, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>), and which is still in full force in Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">An astonishment</span> (see on Jeremiah 2:11). <span class="cmt_word">An hissing</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-14 The fixing of the time during which the Jewish captivity should last, would not only confirm the prophecy, but also comfort the people of God, and encourage faith and prayer. The ruin of Babylon is foretold: the rod will be thrown into the fire when the correcting work is done. When the set time to favour Zion is come, Babylon shall be punished for their iniquity, as other nations have been punished for their sins. Every threatening of the Scripture will certainly be accomplished.</body></html>
