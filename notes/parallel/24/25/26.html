In the corresponding passage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz are specially named.<p><span class= "bld">The kingdoms of the world.</span>--The words are, of course, limited by the horizon of the prophet's vision. As the "world" of the New Testament writers was the Roman Empire, so in the life of Jeremiah it was identical with that of Babylon. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-38.htm" title="And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.">Daniel 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-22.htm" title="It is you, O king, that are grown and become strong: for your greatness is grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.">Daniel 4:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The king of Sheshach.--</span>The name, which obviously is, from its position, the culminating point of the whole prophecy, is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-41.htm" title="How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!">Jeremiah 51:41</a>. No city or country bearing this name is mentioned in the Old Testament or in any ancient writer. The traditional Rabbinic explanation is beyond doubt the true one. We have here the earliest known example of the use of a cypher-writing to disguise the meaning of what was written from all but the initiated. The cypher in this instance, known by the significant name of ATBASH (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>A taking the place of T, and T of A, B of SH, and SH of B, and so on), consisted in the use of the Hebrew alphabet in an inverted order, thus giving SHeSHaCH as an equivalent for BaBeL. This, then, was the crowning mystery reserved to the last. The Chaldaean kingdom was to do its work as the scourge of God upon the nations; but it was simply an instrument in His hand, as the Assyrians had been in their day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm" title="Shall the ax boast itself against him that hews therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shakes it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.">Isaiah 10:15</a>); and when the work was done, the law of a righteous retribution would be felt by it and by its rulers. It adds to the point of the enigma that the word Sheshach would suggest to an Hebrew, taking its probable etymology, the idea of "crouching" or "sinking." It may be noted (1) that the use of such a cypher seems to belong to the same mental characteristics as the prominence of the Hebrew alphabet in the acrostic structure of the Lamentations; (2) that the name is omitted by the LXX. both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-41.htm" title="How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!">Jeremiah 51:41</a>; and (3) that another instance of the same cypher is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the middle of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;">Jeremiah 51:1</a>. The second fact is presumptive evidence that it was not found in the copy which the Greek translators had before them; and the natural inference from this is that there were two editions of the prophecy even in the prophet's time--one with and the other without the enigmatic word, the latter being probably the earlier of the two, the former adding, for the comfort of Israel, at once the limits of their exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-14.htm" title="For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.">Jeremiah 25:14</a>), and this intimation (so veiled that the Chaldaeans, if they came across it, would not be likely to understand its meaning) of the way in which it would at last be brought to its close. The use of the cypher has, however, been questioned by some writers, who refer the name to <span class= "ital">shishaki, </span>a possible form of the name of the moon-god of the Chaldaeans (Rawlinson: Herod, i., p. 616). If the existence of any obscure region bearing the name could be proved, it would still be perfectly compatible with the use of the cypher, as veiling its true significance. Other meanings for the word, such as "the warlike city," "the king's palace," have been suggested by recent scholars.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the north</span>. The distant, mysterious north. <span class="cmt_word">Far and near, one with another.</span> The Hebrew has, "the near and the far, the one to the other;" i.e. whether near or far in relation to each other, for of course with regard to Judah they were all "the far north." <span class="cmt_word">All the kingdoms of the world,</span> etc. This is far from being the only instance in which a special judgment upon a nation or nations is apparently identified with a great final judgment upon the world (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-12</a>). The truth is that every great serf-manifestation of the Divine Governor of the world is a fresh act in that great drama of which the universal judgment will be the close. Hence the prophets, whose perspective was necessarily limited, seeing the cud but not all that was to precede it, speak as if the end were nearer at hand than it really was. <span class="cmt_word">The king of Sheshach</span>, etc. This clause, however, is omitted in the Septuagint, and is too manifestly the insertion of an unwise copyist or editor. For, though perfectly true that Babylon was to suffer punishment afterwards, it is most inappropriate to mention it here at the end of a list of the nations which Babylon itself was to punish. "Sheshach," it should be explained, is the form assumed by the word "Babylon" in the cypher called Athbash (A = T, B = SH, etc.). It happens to convey a very appropriate meaning, viz. "humiliation" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). A similar instance of cypher allegory occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>. "Sheshach" occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-41.htm">Jeremiah 51:41</a>, where, however, it is omitted by the Septuagint. [Dr. Lauth, of Munich, thinks that Sheshach is equivalent to Sisku, the name of a district in Babylonia; but the reading Sisku is uncertain. (See <span class="accented">Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 1881, p. 48.)] <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:15-29 The evil and the good events of life are often represented in Scripture as cups. Under this figure is represented the desolation then coming upon that part of the world, of which Nebuchadnezzar, who had just began to reign and act, was to be the instrument; but this destroying sword would come from the hand of God. The desolations the sword should make in all these kingdoms, are represented by the consequences of excessive drinking. This may make us loathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of it are used to set forth such a woful condition. Drunkenness deprives men of the use of their reason, makes men as mad. It takes from them the valuable blessing, health; and is a sin which is its own punishment. This may also make us dread the judgments of war. It soon fills a nation with confusion. They will refuse to take the cup at thy hand. They will not believe Jeremiah; but he must tell them it is the word of the Lord of hosts, and it is in vain for them to struggle against Almighty power. And if God's judgments begin with backsliding professors, let not the wicked expect to escape.</body></html>
