he shall mightily roar on his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.">Jeremiah 25:30</a> is here expanded. The "shepherds" are, as usual, the rulers of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-21.htm" title="For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-22.htm" title="The wind shall eat up all your pastors, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.">Jeremiah 22:22</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Wallow yourselves in the ashes.</span>--The words in italics have probably been added to bring the passage into conformity with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm" title="O daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come on us.">Jeremiah 6:26</a>, but they are not needed, and the interpretation is unauthorised. Better, therefore, <span class= "ital">roll on the ground. </span>By some interpreters the word is rendered "sprinkle yourselves." The "principal of the flock" are the "strong ones," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the best and fattest of the rams, denoting figuratively the princes and captains of the people.<p><span class= "bld">And of your dispersions.</span>--The Hebrew text seems faulty, and a slight alteration, now generally accepted, gives, <span class= "ital">and I will scatter you.</span><p><span class= "bld">Like a pleasant vessel.</span>--The sudden change of metaphor is somewhat startling, as judged by our rules of rhetoric; but the poets and prophets of Israel wrote without the fear of criticism, and used each image that presented itself, if it was fit for its immediate purpose, without caring much for continuity. The thought of the scattered flock suggested the idea of a dispersion or breaking-up of another kind, even that of the "pleasant vessel" (literally, <span class= "ital">the vessel of desire, i.e., </span>a vase made as for kingly and honourable uses), falling with a crash and shivered into fragments, which Jeremiah had presented to the people in his acted parable and spoken words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>. The LXX. translators give <span class= "ital">like the chosen rams, </span>as if anxious to avoid the mixed metaphor, and venturing on a conjectural emendation of the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wallow yourselves in the ashes</span>.

Who can avoid trembling when God speaks in displeasure? The days are fully come; the time fixed in the Divine counsels, which will make the nations wholly desolate. The tender and delicate shall share the common calamity. Even those who used to live in peace, and did nothing to provoke, shall not escape. Blessed be God, there is a peaceable habitation above, for all the sons of peace. The Lord will preserve his church and all believers in all changes; for nothing can separate them from his love.</body></html>
