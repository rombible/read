It adds to the interest that this name so given appears in the reign of Josiah, and must therefore have been familiar to Jeremiah. There it is applied to the Mount of Olives as having been the centre of the worship of Ashtoreth and Chemosh and Milcom, destroying the faith and life of Israel. Here, not without the thought that the false worship of Babylon was the root of all its evils, the prophet applies it to that city. The use of the term "mountain," literally quite inapplicable, was symbolical of its sovereignty. The latter clause of the verse suggests the idea that the prophet had before him the picture of a volcano.<p><span class= "bld">And will make thee a burnt mountain.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a mountain of burning</span>--either actively, as rolling down its lava and stones to the destruction of all below; or passively, as spent and burnt out. As the sentence describes the doom of Babylon, the latter meaning seems preferable. It is interesting to note the fact that there is an extinct volcano known as <span class= "ital">Koukal </span>(= fire), which rises to a height of 300 feet above the river <span class= "ital">Khabour, </span>in Western Assyria (the Chebar of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>), consisting of loose lava, scoriae, and ashes. (Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies, </span>i. 189.) Possibly the prophet, who had journeyed to the Euphrates, had seen in this the symbol of the "destroying mountain" that destroyed itself. Babylon was for him an extinct volcano.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - Another image for the destruction of Babylon. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O destroying mountain.</span> The description evidently points to a volcano. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jehovah says that he will roll the mountain down from the rocks, which can only be understood of the stones and lava hurled down from the crater; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he will make it a "mountain of burning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either to a burning, <span class="accented">or</span>, more forcibly, a burnt out mountain; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that, as a consequence of this, its stones shall be unsuitable for the purposes of the builder. Now, Palestine, it has been clearly made out, "lies almost in the centre of one great volcano region of the earth's surface, that, namely, which includes the basin of the Mediterranean and the provinces of Western or Central Asia. Traces of that volcanic action are found in every direction. The black basaltic rock of the Hauran, the hot springs of Tiberius and Emmaus and Gadara, the naphtha fountains near the Dead Sea, the dykes of porphyry and other volcanic rooks that force their way through the limestone, the many eaves in the limestone rocks themselves, - all these show that we are treading on ground where the forces of the hidden fires of earth have been in times past in active operation. We are, that is, in a zone of earthquakes" (Plumptre, 'Biblical Studies,' p. 136; comp. Pusey's note on Amos 4:11). There is a striking parallel to this prophetic description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-8.htm">Revelation 8:8</a>, where the destruction of a great empire is likened to the submersion in the sea of a great burning mountain, (Vitringa has noticed the parallel.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
