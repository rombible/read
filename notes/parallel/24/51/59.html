The mention of both father and grandfather leaves no doubt that Seraiah was the brother of Jeremiah's friend and secretary, Baruch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-13.htm" title="And I charged Baruch before them, saying,">Jeremiah 32:13</a>). It was, therefore, natural that the prophet should select him as the depository of the great prediction. The term "quiet prince," which the Authorised version adopts from Luther, means really <span class= "ital">prince of the resting-place, </span>and describes an office like that of our quartermaster-general. He would seem to have been attendant on Zedekiah, probably appointed by Nebuchadnezzar to regulate the details of the journey to Babylon, and arrange the resting-places at its several stages. The versions seem to have been perplexed by the unusual title, the LXX. giving "ruler of the gifts," and the Vulgate "prince of prophecy." The prediction would seem to have been of the nature of a parting gift to him.<p><span class= "bld">In the fourth year of his reign.</span>--The date is significant as giving a missing link in the history. The beginning of Zedekiah's reign was memorable for the gathering at Jerusalem of ambassadors from the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, obviously for the purpose of forming a confederacy against Nebuchadnezzar, and Jeremiah had condemned all such schemes as contrary to the will of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/27-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 27:1-13</a>). It is probable that Nebuchadnezzar summoned the king of Judah to Babylon to question him as to this scheme, and to demand an act of renewed homage. On this journey he was accompanied by the brother of the prophet's friend and fellow-worker, and Jeremiah takes the opportunity of committing to his charge what we may call an esoteric prophecy, lifting up the veil of the future. He counselled submission for the present, because resistance was premature, and would prove futile. He looked forward to the time when the law of retribution would be fulfilled in Babylon as it had been fulfilled in Jerusalem. The whole proceeding was in perfect harmony with the prediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm" title="And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.">Jeremiah 27:7</a>, that all nations should serve Nebuchadnezzar and his son and his son's son till the "very time of his land" should come. It lies in the nature of the case that a duplicate copy was kept by Baruch or Jeremiah, of which the present text of Jeremiah 50, 51 is a transcript.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 59-64.</span> - <span class="accented">Epilogue</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The word,</span> etc. (see ver. 61). <span class="cmt_word">Seraiah</span>.

It would thus be an embassy, of which Seraiah was the head. According to the ordinary reading, Zedekiah went himself. <span class="cmt_word">A quiet prince.</span> Not so. The Hebrew means probably, "in command over the resting place," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took charge of the royal caravan, and arranged the halting places. But the Targum and the Septuagint have a more probable reading (not, however, one involving a change in the consonants of the text, "in command over the gifts," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the functionary who took charge of the presents made to the king. M. Lenormant speaks of an official called "magister largitionum" (<span class="accented">bel tabti</span>) in the Assyrian court ('Syllabaires Cundiformes,' par. 1877, p. 171). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:59-64 This prophecy is sent to Babylon, to the captives there, by Seraiah, who is to read it to his countrymen in captivity. Let them with faith see the end of these threatening powers, and comfort themselves herewith. When we see what this world is, how glittering its shows, and how flattering its proposals, let us read in the book of the Lord that it shall shortly be desolate. The book must be thrown into the river Euphrates. The fall of the New Testament Babylon is thus represented, Re 18:21. Those that sink under the weight of God's wrath and curse, sink for ever. Babylon, and every antichrist, will soon sink and rise no more for ever. Let us hope in God's word, and quietly wait for his salvation; then we shall see, but shall not share, the destruction of the wicked.</body></html>
