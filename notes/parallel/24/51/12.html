The preposition for "upon" may, however, mean <span class= "ital">against</span>, and this agrees better with the context. The "standards" are the banners or signals that direct an attack on a given point of the walls. The "watch" and "watchmen" are the scouts and sentinels placed to give notice of any attempt at a sally on the part of the besieged. The "ambush" may indicate generally any sudden attack, or, more specifically, the stratagem of a feigned flight, like that employed by Joshua in the attack on Ai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/8-14.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.">Joshua 8:14-16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/20-33.htm" title="And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.">Judges 20:33-35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the walls of Babylon;</span> rather, <span class="accented">toward the walls</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>). The "standard" was carried before the army, to show the direction of the march. <span class="cmt_word">Make the watch strong.</span> Not merely for the safety of the invaders, but to blockade the city.

Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
