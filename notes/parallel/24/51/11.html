The LXX. and Vulgate agree in rendering the noun "quivers" instead of "shields," but this would seem to have been a conjecture rising out of a wish to connect the two clauses. The rendering of the Authorised version agrees with the use of the word in Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-4.htm" title="Your neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, where on there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm" title="The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls round about, and the Gammadims were in your towers: they hanged their shields on your walls round about; they have made your beauty perfect.">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm" title="And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.">2Kings 11:10</a>. Some critics interpret the words as meaning "fill the shields with oil," as parallel to "sharpen the arrows," and agreeing with "anoint the shield" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm" title="Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.">Isaiah 21:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Of the kings of the Medes.</span>--As with the Greeks in their use of the terms Medise and Medism, so with the Hebrews the Medes are more prominent than the Persians in the work of destruction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm" title="Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.">Isaiah 13:17</a>). The "kings" are the chieftains of tribes more or less independent, but owning the suzerainty of the Persian king. It is noticeable that the ruler of Babylon, after its capture by Cyrus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm" title="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.">Daniel 5:31</a>, is "Darius the Median," and that he is called a "king."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make bright;</span> rather, <span class="accented">polish</span>, so that the arrows may penetrate easily (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, "a polished shaft"). <span class="cmt_word">Gather the shields;</span> rather, <span class="accented">fill the shields</span> (viz. with your arms); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> take hold of them. Comp. the phrase, "to fill the hand with the bow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>). The rendering" quivers" is wanting in philological authority, and seems to have been inferred from this passage, where, however, it is unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the Medes.</span> The prophet speaks of the Medes and not the Persians (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>). "The reason, probably, is twofold: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the name <span class="accented">Madai</span> became known to the Jews at an earlier period than <span class="accented">Paras</span>, 'Persia;' and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Mazares and Harpagus, Herod., 1:157, 162)" (Cheyne's 'Prophecies of Isaiah,' 2:275, 276). The new Cyrus inscription throws light on the latter circumstance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
