I carried an aqueduct across these great waters that are like unto the depths of the sea." See also <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 128. The channels which were cut for the waters of the Euphrates seemed at once intended for a line of defence against attack, and for irrigation and navigation. To some extent Babylon, though an inland city, must have presented an appearance like that of Venice or Amsterdam.<p><span class= "bld">The measure of thy covetousness.</span>--The measure is literally "an ell," and for "covetousness" many commentators give the meaning of "that which is cut off," a "piece" or "section." So taken, we may translate <span class= "ital">the ell-measure of thy portion, </span>the allotted time of prosperity decreed in the Divine counsels. Others, following the Vulgate, <span class= "ital">"pedalis precisionis tu?,</span>" give "the ell-measure of thy cutting off," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the appointed time of destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Babylon is addressed as <span class="cmt_word">thou that dwellest upon many waters,</span> with reference, not only to the Euphrates, but to the canals, dykes, and marshes which surrounded the city. <span class="cmt_word">The measure of thy covetousness.</span> A strange expression, even when we have supplied (and have we a right to do so?) a suitable verb, such as "is full." "Measure" is, literally, <span class="accented">ell</span>, "covetousness" should rather be <span class="accented">gain, or spoil</span>. Another possible rendering is, "The <span class="accented">ell</span> measure of thy cutting off." In fact, the root meaning of the word rendered "gain," or "covetousness," is "to cut off;" and the figure of cutting off a man's half-finished life, like a web from the loom, is familiar to us from the psalm of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
