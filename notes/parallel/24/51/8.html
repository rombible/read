The captive people are not invited simply to raise a shout of triumph at the fall of their oppressor: they are to "take balm" (comp. the use of the same image in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-22.htm" title="Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?">Jeremiah 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm" title="Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.">Jeremiah 46:11</a>), and try to heal her. They are still to "seek the peace of the city" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm" title="And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall you have peace.">Jeremiah 29:7</a>), to render kindly service, to pour balm into the bleeding wounds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed</span>. The Hebrew, more forcibly, has "is broken." The Authorized Version wished, perhaps, to avoid the objection that a golden cup could not, properly speaking, be broken. But if we once begin to harmonize the language of Hebrew poetry, we shall have no end. It is not the cup which falls, but the state, considered as a house (the "breach" of God's people is constantly referred to; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Howl for her</span>. Sympathetic bystanders are dramatically appealed to. From the next verse it would seem that they are the various foreigners who, whether by choice or force, have been resident in Babylon, and who have acquired an interest in her fate. Hitzig thinks the foreign mercenaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>) or allies are specially referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Take balm for her pain</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>). The images of fracture and wound are combined, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
