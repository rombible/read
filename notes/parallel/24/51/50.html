In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/137-5.htm" title="If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.">Psalm 137:5-6</a> we have, as it were, by anticipation, the answer of the exiles.

It is not, however, perfectly clear whether the escape is from the sword of Babylon or from that of Divine vengeance. The parallel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-14.htm">Isaiah 24:14</a> would suggest the latter; but in the following verses the fall of Babylon is described as still to come. <span class="cmt_word">Stand not still.</span> Lest ye be overtaken by the judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
