The assurance of this returning love does not rest on any plea in extenuation of the nation's guilt, which the words that follow admit without reserve. For "his" it would be better to read <span class= "ital">her </span>or <span class= "ital">their, </span>as keeping up the metaphor.<p><span class= "bld">Against the Holy One of Israel.</span>--On Jeremiah's use of the name, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-29.htm" title="Call together the archers against Babylon: all you that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her: for she has been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.">Jeremiah 50:29</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-14.</span> - The covenant between Jehovah and Israel is one reason why Babylon must fall; and Babylon's own guilt is another.

The Hebrew is much more forcible, "is not widowed" - alluding to the fundamental Old Testament idea of a mystic marriage between God and his people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Was filled with sin;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with guilt</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">asham</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
