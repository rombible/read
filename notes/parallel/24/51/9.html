They have done what they could, but all was in vain. The guilt could not be washed away, the punishment could not be averted. The "judgment" is measureless as is the distance from heaven to earth. This is also reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm" title="For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.">Revelation 18:5</a>. For the phrase, as applied to Nebuchadnezzar, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-20.htm" title="The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;">Daniel 4:20</a>. Possibly there may be an allusive reference to the tower of Babel, "reaching unto heaven," as the type of Babylonian greatness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm" title="And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We would have healed Babylon.</span> Experience shows that it is useless to attempt to correct such inveterate evils. <span class="cmt_word">Everyone into his own country</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Her judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her punishment. Perhaps there is an allusion to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, burned by fire from heaven. But we might also render "her crime" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>, where "worthy of death" is more strictly "a capital crime"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
