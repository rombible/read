On the whole it would seem best to accept the meaning of "strangers," the prophet connecting it with the verb for "fan," which contains the same consonants, for the sake of a rhythmical assonance. The imagery in either case is that of the familiar picture of the "threshing-floor," where the "strong wind" scatters the chaff in all directions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm" title="Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.">Isaiah 29:5</a>). The word for "empty" is the same as that used with an emphatic significance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-7.htm" title="And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcasses will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.">Jeremiah 19:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Farmers</span>. This is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, according to the Massoretic pointing, however, we should render "enemies." Possibly the prophet intended to suggest both meanings, <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">o</span> being so nearly related. <span class="cmt_word">Shall empty her land.</span> The original has a much mere striking word, shall pour out (for the figures, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-12.htm">Jeremiah 48:12</a>), which occurs again in similar contexts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> (Hebrew, 2). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
