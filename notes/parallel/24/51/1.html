<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-5.htm" title="Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a> the phrase is used for "stirring up the spirit" of a man, and that may be its meaning here. The context, however, suggests, in the "fanners" of the next verse, the literal meaning of "wind," and it is quite possible that the phrase may have been used by Jeremiah in this sense, and afterwards acquired a figurative meaning. It does not appear in any earlier book of the Old Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in the heart of my adversaries. </span>In the judgment of most commentators the Hebrew words <span class= "ital">Leb-kamai, </span>which answer to the last ten words of the English, furnish another example of the <span class= "ital">Atbash </span>or cypher-writing of which we have seen an instance in the <span class= "ital">Sheshach </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm" title="And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.">Jeremiah 25:26</a>. Interpreted by that cypher <span class= "ital">Leb-kamai </span>becomes <span class= "ital">Chasdim </span>or Chaldaeans. Obviously the significance of the cypher-words gives force to its employment here, and presents a parallel to the use of the names Merathaim and Pekod in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-21.htm" title="Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, said the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded you.">Jeremiah 50:21</a>. Some commentators, indeed, rest in that significance without recognising the hidden meaning of the Atbash. The LXX. and Syriac versions translate "against the Chaldaeans," as recognising the use of the cypher. Both this and Sheshach had probably become familiar in the correspondence between the exiles and those of their countrymen who remained in Judaea, and so both would understand them when used by Jeremiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me</span>. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">leb-kamai</span>, which is <span class="accented">Kasdim</span>, or <span class="accented">Chaldea</span>, written in the cypher called Athbash (see on Jeremiah 25:26); just as <span class="accented">Sheshach</span> in ver. 41 is equivalent to Babel. The question arises whether the prophet himself is responsible for this covert way of writing, or a scribe in later times (so Ewald). In favour of the former view it may be urged that Babylon and Chaldea receive symbolic names (though not in Athbash) in the connected chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21, 31, 32</a>); in favour of the latter, that the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 1, and does not express Sheshach in ver. 41, also that the clause to which Sheshach belongs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a> is of very dubious genuineness. <span class="cmt_word">A destroying wind;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the spirit</span> (<span class="accented">ruakh</span>) <span class="accented">of a</span> <span class="accented">destroyer</span> (or perhaps, of <span class="accented">destruction</span>). The verb rendered in this verse "raise up," when used in connection with <span class="accented">ruakh</span>, always means "to excite the spirit of any one" (ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
