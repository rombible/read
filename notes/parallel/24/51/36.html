So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm" title="The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.">Isaiah 21:1</a> Babylon is described as "the desert of the sea." The Hebrew word for "springs" is in the singular, her <span class= "ital">reservoir. </span>Probably the literal and figurative meanings run into one another, and the "drying up" describes the exhaustion of the power of which the "sea" was the symbol. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm" title="And the sixth angel poured out his vial on the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.">Revelation 16:12</a> we have apparently an allusive reference to the language of this prediction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her sea;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Euphrates (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>), or perhaps the lake dug by Nitocris to receive the waters of the Euphrates, Herod., 1:185 (Payne Smith).

The Hebrew word <span class="accented">makor is</span> used here collectively for the whole system of canals and reservoirs for the storing of the water. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</body></html>
