The name of Chimham throws us back on the history of Barzillai in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm" title="Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.">2Samuel 19:37</a>. When the Gileadite chief pleaded his age as a ground for not accepting David's invitation to live at his court, the offer was transferred to his son Chimham. On the king's death-bed he was specially commended to the care of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-7.htm" title="But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.">1Kings 2:7</a>). It seems probable that some part of David's personal patrimony, as distinct from his royal domains, had been bestowed on him, and that he had perpetuated his gratitude by erecting a resting-place for travellers, probably enough identical with the "inn" of the Nativity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>). The plan of the fugitives under Johanan took them to Bethlehem, as lying on the road to Egypt, where they hoped to find a refuge both from the anarchy in which the land had been left by the death of Gedaliah, and from the severe punishment which the Chaldaeans were likely to inflict, without too careful an inquiry into the question who had been guilty of it, for the murder of the ruler whom they had appointed. The mere fact of their having remained with Ishmael might be construed into circumstantial evidence of complicity. There they halt, and take counsel.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt in the habitation of Chimham.</span> Chimham was the son of the rich Gileadite Barzillai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37-40</a>), who probably founded this "habitation" or rather "hospice" ("khan," "caravanserai"), for the accommodation of travellers - a characteristic mark of public-spirited liberality. Josephus and Aquila, however, appear to have read "by the hurdles of Chimham" - a very possible name for a locality in such a pastoral country. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:11-18 The success of villany must be short, and none can prosper who harden their hearts against God. And those justly lose comfort in real fears, who excuse themselves in sin by pretended fears. The removal of a prudent and peaceable ruler, and the succession of another who is rash and ambitious, affects the welfare of many. Only those are happy and steady who fear the Lord and walk in his ways.</body></html>
