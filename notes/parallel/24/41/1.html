As the seventh month included the Feast of Tabernacles, it is not unlikely that they came as if to share in its festivities. Three months had passed since the capture of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-2.htm" title="And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.">Jeremiah 39:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - Assassination of Gedaliah and other Jews. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the seventh month;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two months after the destruction of Jerusalem and the appointment of Gedaliah. It seems strange, however, that the occurrences related in ch. 40. and 41. should have taken so short a time. Gratz calls in question the accuracy of the chronological statement. He quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-24.htm">Ezekiel 33:24-29</a>, which shows that at least six months (according to his calculation) after the fall of Jerusalem Jewish fugitives still lingered on, and hoped to obtain possession of their fatherland, and points out that time was necessary for Gedaliah to erect a temple at Mizpah (see on ver. 5), for cities to arise out of their ruins, and for cultivation of the soil to be resumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>). Besides, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-30.htm">Jeremiah 52:30</a>, a third deportation of Jews is mentioned. How can this be accounted for, if, only two months after the fall of Jerusalem, the remnant of the Jewish population emigrated under Johanan ben Kareah to Egypt? Gratz shows reason for thinking that this last deportation stands in close connection with Gedaliah's death, and that consequently the interval between this latter event and the fall of Jerusalem lasted, not two months, but five years. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Elishama.</span> Perhaps the Elishama men. tioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> as a secretary of state; or perhaps a son of David of that name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>; "son" being taken here in a wider sense). <span class="cmt_word">And the princes of the king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">one of</span>) <span class="accented">the princes of the king. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Even ten men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> ten men.

As death often meets men where they least expect it, we should continually search whether we are in such a state and frame of mind, as we would wish to be found in when called to appear before our Judge. Sometimes the ransom of a man's life is his riches. But those who think to bribe death, saying, Slay us not, for we have treasures in the field, will find themselves wretchedly deceived. This melancholy history warns us, never to be secure in this world. We never can be sure of peace on this side heaven.</body></html>
