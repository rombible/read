and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.">2Chronicles 16:6</a>. Baasha had tried to fortify Ramah as an outpost of his kingdom. Asa called in the help of Benhadad, king of Syria, and compelled him to desist, and then carried off the stones and timber to strengthen Mizpah as a position of defence. The "pit" was probably a trench with a drawbridge over it, so constructed as to stop all approach from the neighbouring kingdom; or else one of the tanks or reservoirs constructed to supply the fortress with water. A various reading gives "the pit of Gedaliah," instead of "because of Gedaliah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the pit... which Arm the king had made,</span> etc. Nothing is said of this "pit" in the historical books, but only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a> = <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a>) that Asa used the material with which Baasha had fortified Ramah to build Geba and Mizpah. It would seem that this "pit" formed part of Asa's defensive works; probably it was a cistern to supply the town with water during the siege. <span class="cmt_word">Because of Gedaliah;</span> was it. The rendering "because of" must be abandoned. The Septuagint has, in this part of the verse, the very natural words, "was a great pit," and this reading is adopted by Movers, Hitzig, and Graft. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-10 Those who hate the worshippers of God, often put on the appearance of piety, that they may the easier hurt them. As death often meets men where they least expect it, we should continually search whether we are in such a state and frame of mind, as we would wish to be found in when called to appear before our Judge. Sometimes the ransom of a man's life is his riches. But those who think to bribe death, saying, Slay us not, for we have treasures in the field, will find themselves wretchedly deceived. This melancholy history warns us, never to be secure in this world. We never can be sure of peace on this side heaven.</body></html>
