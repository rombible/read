yes, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words to you.">Jeremiah 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm" title="Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.">Jeremiah 18:18</a>). Then, as at other times, a man's foes were those of his own household (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-36.htm" title="And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.">Matthew 10:36</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Every brother will utterly supplant.</span>--The word is that which gave the patriarch his significant name of Jacob, the supplanter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm" title="And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them.">Genesis 25:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm" title="And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?">Genesis 27:36</a>). Jeremiah seems to say that the people have forfeited their claims to the name of the true Israel. Every brother Israelite is found to be a thorough-paced Jacob. The adverb "utterly" expresses the force of the Hebrew reduplication of the verb.<p><span class= "bld">Will walk with slanders.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">walketh a slanderer.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take ye heed every one of his neighbor</span>. Such was the result of clinging to an unprogressive religion - one which refused to be spiritualized by the prophets. Certainly, if the established religion was so inefficacious, it was self-condemned. Hero we find the prophet depicting a state of society in which the elementary bonds are already dissolved, and suspicion becomes the natural attitude even of a good man. We find a very similar picture in the last chapter of Micah - a chapter, it is true, which stands apart from the rest of the book, as it implies a greater development of wickedness than the rest of Micah and the contemporary prophecies of Isaiah would lead us to expect. Are these prophetic descriptions just and accurate? We may allow something, no doubt, for the warmth of feeling natural to every human preacher, even under the influence of inspiration; but we must not allow ourselves to explain away the obvious meaning of the prophets. The latter and their disciples were "the salt" of their country; and in proportion as their influence declined, the natural effects of a non-moral, purely ritualistic religion showed themselves on a larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">Every brother</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. every fellow-tribesman or fellow-citizen. <span class="cmt_word">Will utterly supplant</span>. There is nothing in the context to suggest an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a> (Jacob). The verb has its common sense of deceiving. The tense should be the present, not the future, both here and in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Will walk</span>; rather, <span class="accented">goeth about</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-11 Jeremiah wept much, yet wished he could weep more, that he might rouse the people to a due sense of the hand of God. But even the desert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected? He has many ways of turning a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwell therein.</body></html>
