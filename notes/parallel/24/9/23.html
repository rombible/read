Now there comes the conclusion of the whole matter--that the one way of salvation is to renounce all reliance on the wisdom, greatness, wealth of the world, and to glory only in knowing Jehovah. The "wise man" is, as before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-9.htm" title="The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: see, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?">Jeremiah 8:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm" title="Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perishes and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passes through?">Jeremiah 9:12</a>, the scribe, or recognised teacher of the people<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - These two verses were hardly composed for their present position, though a connection may, of course, be thought out for them.
