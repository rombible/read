<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="But he that glories, let him glory in the Lord.">2Corinthians 10:17</a>. He had learnt from it to estimate the wisdom and the greatness on which the Corinthians prided themselves at their true value. We may find a parallel even in the higher words which teach us that "eternal life is to know God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>), to understand those attributes, love, judgment, righteousness, which we associate with our thoughts of Him, as indeed they are in their infinite perfection, and which when we know them as we ought to know, we must needs strive to reproduce.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The knowledge of God relates to three leading attributes, the combination of which is very instructive. <span class="cmt_word">First, loving-kindness.</span> This is not to be understood in a vague and general sense of the love of God to all mankind; the term has a special connotation with regard to the Israelitish people. God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination "loving-kindness and faithfulness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>, corrected version), and as here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5, 6</a>), "mercy and righteousness." Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his "loving-kindness," vouchsafes. <span class="cmt_word">Next, judgment, or justice.</span> Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>). Then, <span class="cmt_word">righteousness</span> - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence "righteousness" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the "plan of salvation." It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-26 In this world of sin and sorrow, ending soon in death and judgement, how foolish for men to glory in their knowledge, health, strength, riches, or in any thing which leaves them under the dominion of sin and the wrath of God! and of which an account must hereafter be rendered; it will but increase their misery. Those are the true Israel who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Let us prize the distinction which comes from God, and will last for ever. Let us seek it diligently.</body></html>
