but even taking "dragons" in its non-mythical sense as applied to some species of serpent, there is nothing in the word to lead us to assign this meaning. The mistake has probably arisen from the likeness of the word to those translated "serpent" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/7-9.htm" title="When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.">Exodus 7:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-12.htm" title="For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.">Exodus 7:12</a>, "whale" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm" title="Am I a sea, or a whale, that you set a watch over me?">Job 7:12</a>, and "dragons" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm" title="You shall tread on the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet.">Psalm 91:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will make</span>, etc. Notice how the utterances of the prophets stand side by side with those of Jehovah.

But even the desert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected? He has many ways of turning a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwell therein.</body></html>
