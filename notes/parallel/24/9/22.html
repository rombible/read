The following words are mistranslated in the Authorized Version, and should run, not <span class="cmt_word">even</span>, but <span class="accented">and</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the carcasses of men shall fall</span>; etc. It is most improbable, however, that a fresh Divine revelation should begin with "and." With other points, the word rendered "speak" would mean "pestilence." Possibly the word fell out of Ver. 21, where it would find an excellent place in the second clause (as an explanatory parallel to "death," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a>), which would thus obtain greater roundness and symmetry. <span class="cmt_word">As the handful</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as thickly as one heap of corn succeeds another under the deft hand of the leaper. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:12-22 In Zion the voice of joy and praise used to be heard, while the people kept close to God; but sin has altered the sound, it is now the voice of lamentation. Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow. This alone can bring true comfort; and it can turn the heaviest afflictions into precious mercies.</body></html>
