How could Israel pride itself in that which it had in common with some of the nations that it most abhorred. The later Idumaeans seem to have abandoned the practice till it was forced upon them by John Hyrcanus (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant. xi.</span> 9, 15:7). Jerome (<span class= "ital">in loc.</span>) affirms that the nations named practised circumcision in his time, and its adoption by Islam indicates its prevalence among the Arabs in that of Mahomet.<p><span class= "bld">All that are in the utmost corners.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">all that have the corners </span>(<span class= "ital">of their temples</span>)<span class= "ital"> shorn. </span>The epithet, like our "cross-eared" or "round-head," was obviously one of scorn, and was applied (as again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm" title="And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:32</a>) to a wild Arabian tribe who, as described by Herodotus (3:8), shaved their temples and let their hair grow long behind. The "wilderness" is the Arabian desert to the east of Palestine, inhabited by the Ishmaelites and other kindred races. As if to complete the contempt which he pours on circumcision, the prophet speaks of the barbarous people, whose customs were specially forbidden to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27</a>), as in this respect standing on the same level with Israel. If circumcision by itself were enough to secure immunity from judgment, they too, as practising a rite analogous though not identical, might claim it.<p><span class= "bld">All these nations are uncircumcised.</span>--The English Version makes the prophet say exactly the opposite of what he really said. <span class= "ital">All the heathen </span>(not "these nations") are in God's sight as uncircumcised, whether they practise the outward rite or not--and the state of Israel was not a whit better than theirs, for she too was uncircumcised in heart. Once again Jeremiah is the forerunner of St. Paul's <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-25.htm" title="For circumcision truly profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.">Romans 2:25-29</a>. It may be noted that the same nations are enumerated afterwards as coming under Nebuchadnezzar's conquests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that are in the utmost corners</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all that</span> <span class="accented">are corner-clipped</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that have the hair cut off about the ears and temples. Herodotus tells us, speaking of the Arabs, "Their practice is to cut the hair in a ring, away from the temples" (3:8); and among the representatives of various nations, colored figures of whom are given in the tomb of Rameses III., we find some with a square place shaved just above the temples. The hair below this shaven place was allowed to grow long, and then plaited into a leek. It is to such customs that Jeremiah alludes here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>. A prohibition is directed against them in the Levitical Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all these nations are uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>, etc. Another obscure expression. Does it mean (taken together with the following clause), "The Gentile peoples are uncircumcised in the flesh, and the people of Israel is equally so in heart?" But this does not agree with facts (see above, on Ver. 25). It is safer, therefore, to assume that "uncircumcised" is equivalent to "circumcised in uncircumcision" (Ver. 25). The next clause will then simply give the most conspicuous instance of this unspiritual obedience to a mere form. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-26 In this world of sin and sorrow, ending soon in death and judgement, how foolish for men to glory in their knowledge, health, strength, riches, or in any thing which leaves them under the dominion of sin and the wrath of God! and of which an account must hereafter be rendered; it will but increase their misery. Those are the true Israel who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Let us prize the distinction which comes from God, and will last for ever. Let us seek it diligently.</body></html>
