But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.">Jonah 1:5</a>, correctly renders a term which seems, from its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-8.htm" title="The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were your mariners: your wise men, O Tyrus, that were in you, were your pilots.">Ezekiel 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-27.htm" title="Your riches, and your fairs, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your caulkers, and the occupiers of your merchandise, and all your men of war, that are in you, and in all your company which is in the middle of you, shall fall into the middle of the seas in the day of your ruin.">Ezekiel 27:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-29.htm" title="And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand on the land;">Ezekiel 27:29</a>, as well as from its derivation (from <span class= "ital">salt;</span> comp. the term "old salts"), to denote seafaring men generally. "Those who work the ropes" may be either "steersmen" or "topmen" as contrasted with rowers.<p><span class= "bld">What meanest . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">What to thee sleeping? i.e.,</span> How canst thou sleep so soundly? The motive of the question was no doubt partly the need of sympathy, as in the case of the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-38.htm" title="And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, care you not that we perish?">Mark 4:38</a>), partly a belief in the efficacy of the prophet's prayer. This belief seems to have sprung not solely from superstitious fear lest any deity should be overlooked, but from a vague sense that the God of Israel was pre-eminently great and good. The term used is <span class= "ital">ha Elohim,</span> "the God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The shipmaster;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the chief of the ropemen</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">gubernator</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "the look out man." The captain. <span class="cmt_word">What meanest thou, O sleeper?</span> How canst thou sleep so soundly when our danger is so imminent? If thou canst help us in no other way, at least ask the aid of Heaven. It was the duty of a prophet of the Lord to take the lead in prayer; but here the prophet's stupor is rebuked by the heathen's faith. <span class="cmt_word">Call upon thy God.</span> The sailors' prayers had not been answered, and they arouse Jonah, noting something special about him, perhaps his prophet's dress, or observing that he was an Israelite, and therefore a worshipper of Jehovah, of whose power they had heard. <span class="cmt_word">If so be that God will think upon us.</span> They use the word "God" with the article, <span class="accented">ha Eiohim</span>, as if they had, in spite of their Polytheism, a dim notion of one supreme Deity. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si forte recogitet Deus de nobis</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, "that God may save us." From the apparent use, of the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">ashath</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> in the sense of "shining," some translate here, "if perchance God will shine upon us," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be favourable to us. But the meaning given in the Anglican Version is best supported. So the psalmist says, "The Lord thinketh upon me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-17.htm">Psalm 40:17</a>), implying that God succours and defends him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-7 God sent a pursuer after Jonah, even a mighty tempest. Sin brings storms and tempests into the soul, into the family, into churches and nations; it is a disquieting, disturbing thing. Having called upon their gods for help, the sailors did what they could to help themselves. Oh that men would be thus wise for their souls, and would be willing to part with that wealth, pleasure, and honour, which they cannot keep without making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, and ruining their souls for ever! Jonah was fast asleep. Sin is stupifying, and we are to take heed lest at any time our hearts are hardened by the deceitfulness of it. What do men mean by sleeping on in sin, when the word of God and the convictions of their own consciences, warn them to arise and call on the Lord, if they would escape everlasting misery? Should not we warn each other to awake, to arise, to call upon our God, if so be he will deliver us? The sailors concluded the storm was a messenger of Divine justice sent to some one in that ship. Whatever evil is upon us at any time, there is a cause for it; and each must pray, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. The lot fell upon Jonah. God has many ways of bringing to light hidden sins and sinners, and making manifest that folly which was thought to be hid from the eyes of all living.</body></html>
