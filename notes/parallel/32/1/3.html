Therefore I fled before to Tarshish: for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repent you of the evil.">Jonah 4:2</a>). He foresaw the repentance of the city, and the mercy which would be displayed towards it, and was either jealous of his prophetic reputation, or had a patriotic dislike of becoming a messenger of good to a heathen foe so formidable to his own country.<p><span class= "bld">Tarshish.--</span>This can hardly be any other than <span class= "ital">Tartessus,</span> an ancient Ph?nician colony on the river Guadalquivir, in the south-west of Spain. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-4.htm" title="And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.">Genesis 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-7.htm" title="And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.">1Chronicles 1:7</a>.)<p>A profound moral lesson lies in the choice of this refuge by Jonah. A man who tries to escape from a clearly-recognised duty--especially if he can at the time supply conscience with a plausible excuse--is in danger of falling all the lower, in proportion as his position was high. Jonah, commanded to <span class= "ital">go</span> to Nineveh, in the far north-east, instantly tries to flee to the then farthermost west. Often between the saintly height and an abyss of sin there is no middle resting-point. The man with the highest ideal, when unfaithful to it, is apt to sink lower than the ordinary mortal.<p><span class= "bld">From the presence of the Lord.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">from before the face of Jehovah.</span> The words may imply (1) the belief in a possibility of hiding from the sight of God (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm" title="And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.">Genesis 3:8</a>), a belief which, as we gather from the insistence on its opposite in Psalms 139, lingered late in the popular conception; (2) a renunciation of the prophetic office. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>); (3) Flight from the Holy Land, where the Divine presence was understood to be especially manifested. Commentators have generally rejected the first of these as implying ignorance unworthy of a prophet; but, on embarking, Jonah went below, as if still more securely to hide, and used the same expression to the mariners, who would certainly take it in its literal and popular sense.<p><span class= "bld">Joppa.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Y?pho</span>; now <span class= "ital">Jaffa,</span> the port of Jerusalem. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-46.htm" title="And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.">Joshua 19:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 2:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He found a ship.</span>--Probably a Ph?nician vessel trading between Egypt and Spain, and accustomed to touch at Joppa.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>; probably, <span class="accented">Tartessus</span>, a Phoenician city on the south coast of Spain, and therefore in the opposite direction to Nineveh. He was sent to the far east; he flees to the distant west. <span class="cmt_word">From the presence of the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">from the face of Jehovah.</span> This may mean, from God s special presence in Jerusalem or the Holy Land, as banishment from Cannaan is called "casting out of his sight" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-27.htm">2 Kings 23:27</a>); or, from serving the Lord as his minister (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), Jonah preferring to renounce his office as prophet rather than execute his mission. The former seems the most natural explanation of the phrase. Kimchi says that Jonah supposed that the spirit of prophecy would not extend beyond the land of Israel. He could never have thought to escape from God's all-seeing eye. His repugnance to the duty imposed upon him arose partly from national prejudice, which made him loth to interfere in Gentile business, and partly, as he himself says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), because he feared God's compassion would spare the Ninevites on their repentance, and that thus his prediction would be discredited, and mercy shown to heathens already inimical to Israel, if not known to him as the future conquerors of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Joppa.</span> This is the modern <span class="accented">Jaffa</span> (called Japho in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>), a town on the seacoast thirty miles in a northwesterly direction from Jerusalem. "Jaffa," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 8, etc.), "is one of the oldest cities in the world. It was given to Dan in the distribution of the land by Joshua, and it has been known to history ever since. It owes its existence to the low ledge of rocks which extends into the sea from the extremity of the little cape on which the city stands, and forms a small harbour. Insignificant as it is, and insecure, yet, there being no other on all this coast, it was sufficient to cause a city to spring up around it even in the earliest times, and to sustain its life through numberless changes of dynasties, races, and religions, down to the present hour. It was, in fact, the only harbour of any notoriety possessed by the Jews throughout the greater part of their national existence. To it the timber for both the temples of Jerusalem was brought from Lebanon; and no doubt a lucrative trade in cedar and pine was always carried on through it with the nations who had possession of that goodly mountain. Through it, also, nearly all the foreign commerce of the Jews was conducted, until the artificial pert of Caessarea was built by Herod .... The harbour, howewer, is very inconvenient and insecure. Vessels of any considerable burden must lie out in the open road-stead - a very uneasy berth at all times; and even a moderate wind will oblige them to slip their cables and run out to sea, or seek anchorage at Haifa, sixty miles distant .... The road-stead is liable to sudden and unexpected storms, which stir up a tumultuous sea in a very short time .... The landing also is most inconvenient, and often extremely dangerous. More boats upset, and more lives are lost in the breakers at the north end of the ledge of rocks that defend the inner harbour than anywhere else on this coast." <span class="cmt_word">Went down into it</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>, "went up into it" (Septuagint). Went on board; or, as Jerome says, sought a hiding place in the ship (comp. ver. 5). <span class="cmt_word">With them.</span> With the crew. Jonah had told them (ver. 10) that he was flying from God's service, but, knowing and earing nothing about Jehovah, they took him on board when he paid his fare, and thought nothing of his private reasons for joining them <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3. It is sad to think how much sin is committed in great cities. Their wickedness, as that of Nineveh, is a bold and open affront to God. Jonah must go at once to Nineveh, and there, on the spot, cry against the wickedness of it. Jonah would not go. Probably there are few among us who would not have tried to decline such a mission. Providence seemed to give him an opportunity to escape; we may be out of the way of duty, and yet may meet with a favourable gale. The ready way is not always the right way. See what the best of men are, when God leaves them to themselves; and what need we have, when the word of the Lord comes to us, to have the Spirit of the Lord to bring every thought within us into obedience.</body></html>
