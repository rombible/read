Finding all unavailing, the sailors propose recourse to the ancient custom of casting lots to discover the guilty person against whom the deities are so enraged. Classical authors as well as the Bible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-14.htm" title="In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.">Joshua 7:14</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/14-36.htm" title="And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.">1Samuel 14:36-46</a>) afford many illustrations of the belief that the presence of an impious man would involve all who shared his company in indiscriminate ruin. Naturally the feeling expressed itself most strongly at sea.<p>"Who drags Eleusis' rite to day,<p>That man shall never share my home<p>Or join my voyage; roofs give way,<p>And boats are wrecked; true men and thieves<p>Neglected Justice oft confounds."<p>HOR.: <span class= "ital">Od. iii.</span> 2, 26-30.

Jonah doubtless had meantime complied with the captain's request, but, as the sailors saw, without visible effect. The belief that temporal calamities are often connected with the presence of culprits, and are sent in judgment, is found in classical authors. Thus Plautus, 'Rudena,' 2:21 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Pol minume miror, navis si fracta est tibi,<br />Scelus te et sceleste parta quae vexit bona."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Little I wonder if the ship is wrecked<br />Which carries thee and thy ill-gotten wealth."</span> (Comp. AEschylus, 'Electr.,' 1354; 'Theb.,' 598; Horat., 'Carm.,' 3:2, 26, etc.) The misfortune of the Israelites at Ai was consequent on the sin of Achan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Let us cast lots.</span> (On the Christian view of "lots," see Dr. Pusey's Commentary, pp. 270, 271.) Jerome says here, "The fugitive was taken by lot, not by virtue of the lots, especially of the lots of heathen men, but by the will of him who guided the uncertain lots." <span class="cmt_word">For whose cause;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The unusual nature of the tempest showed them that it was sent in judgment. Commentators cite the story of Diagoras told by Cicero ('De Nat. Deor.,' 3:37). <span class="cmt_word">The lot fell upon Jonah.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, "The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 14:41; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-7 God sent a pursuer after Jonah, even a mighty tempest. Sin brings storms and tempests into the soul, into the family, into churches and nations; it is a disquieting, disturbing thing. Having called upon their gods for help, the sailors did what they could to help themselves. Oh that men would be thus wise for their souls, and would be willing to part with that wealth, pleasure, and honour, which they cannot keep without making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, and ruining their souls for ever! Jonah was fast asleep. Sin is stupifying, and we are to take heed lest at any time our hearts are hardened by the deceitfulness of it. What do men mean by sleeping on in sin, when the word of God and the convictions of their own consciences, warn them to arise and call on the Lord, if they would escape everlasting misery? Should not we warn each other to awake, to arise, to call upon our God, if so be he will deliver us? The sailors concluded the storm was a messenger of Divine justice sent to some one in that ship. Whatever evil is upon us at any time, there is a cause for it; and each must pray, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. The lot fell upon Jonah. God has many ways of bringing to light hidden sins and sinners, and making manifest that folly which was thought to be hid from the eyes of all living.</body></html>
