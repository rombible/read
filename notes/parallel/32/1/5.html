The freight may have been corn, which was exported in considerable quantifies from Joppa (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), or manufactured articles from Tyre, which were exchanged with Spain for silver and other metals. <span class="cmt_word">To lighten it of them;</span> literally, to <span class="accented">lighten from against them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to ease the ship of its burden, or to ease them of their trouble, is <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-22.htm">Exodus 18:22</a>.

Jonah hid himself there before the storm arose. The Hebrew word for "ship" (<span class="accented">sephinah</span>) is found nowhere else, and, probably from its derivation (<span class="accented">saphan</span>, "to cover"), implies that the vessel was decked. <span class="cmt_word">He lay, and was fast asleep;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>, "was asleep and snoring," (Septuagint); <span class="accented">dormiebat sopore gravi</span> (Vulgate). The word used implies a very deep sleep, as that of Sisera (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>) or of the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>). He was fatigued and worn out with mental anxiety, and now being, as he thought, secure, and longing for solitude, he lay down to sleep, unconscious of danger. Contrast this sleep in the storm with that of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>), and that of the apostles who slept for sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-45.htm">Luke 22:45</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-7 God sent a pursuer after Jonah, even a mighty tempest. Sin brings storms and tempests into the soul, into the family, into churches and nations; it is a disquieting, disturbing thing. Having called upon their gods for help, the sailors did what they could to help themselves. Oh that men would be thus wise for their souls, and would be willing to part with that wealth, pleasure, and honour, which they cannot keep without making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, and ruining their souls for ever! Jonah was fast asleep. Sin is stupifying, and we are to take heed lest at any time our hearts are hardened by the deceitfulness of it. What do men mean by sleeping on in sin, when the word of God and the convictions of their own consciences, warn them to arise and call on the Lord, if they would escape everlasting misery? Should not we warn each other to awake, to arise, to call upon our God, if so be he will deliver us? The sailors concluded the storm was a messenger of Divine justice sent to some one in that ship. Whatever evil is upon us at any time, there is a cause for it; and each must pray, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. The lot fell upon Jonah. God has many ways of bringing to light hidden sins and sinners, and making manifest that folly which was thought to be hid from the eyes of all living.</body></html>
