(For the last hypothesis see all that can be collected in Dr. Pusey's commentary on Jonah.)

The fish was not created then and there, but God so ordered it that it should be at the place and should swallow Jonah. The prophet seems, from some expressions in his psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5</a>), to have sunk to the bottom of the sea before he was swallowed by the fish. <span class="cmt_word">A great fish;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). There is nothing in the word to identify the intended animal, and to call it "a whale" is simply a mistranslation. The white shark of the Mediterranean (<span class="accented">Carcharias, vulgaris</span>), which sometimes measures twenty-five feet in length, has been known to swallow a man whole, and even a horse. This may have been the "great fish" in the text (see Dr. Pusey on Jonah, pp. 257, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the belly of the fish.</span> God used the natural agency of the fish, but the preservation of Jonah's life in the animal's belly is plainly supernatural. It is, indeed, analogous to the life of the child in its mother's womb; but it has besides a miraculous element which is unique, unless it was an actual death and revivification, as in the case of Lazarus. Also God ordained this transaction as a type of the resurrection of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Three days and three nights;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to Hebrew usage, parts of the days and nights; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one whole day, and parts of the day before and after this. Jonah was released on the third day (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> with Esther 5:1). The historical nature of this occurrence is substantiated by Christ's reference to it as a figure of his own burial and resurrection. The antitype confirms the truth of the type. It is not credible that Christ would use a mere legendary tale, with no historical basis, to confirm his most solemn statement concerning the momentous fact of his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:13-17 The mariners rowed against wind and tide, the wind of God's displeasure, the tide of his counsel; but it is in vain to think of saving ourselves any other way than by destroying our sins. Even natural conscience cannot but dread blood-guiltiness. And when we are led by Providence God does what he pleases, and we ought to be satisfied, though it may not please us. Throwing Jonah into the sea put an end to the storm. God will not afflict for ever, He will only contend till we submit and turn from our sins. Surely these heathen mariners will rise up in judgment against many called Christians, who neither offer prayers when in distress, nor thanksgiving for signal deliverances. The Lord commands all creatures, and can make any of them serve his designs of mercy to his people. Let us see this salvation of the Lord, and admire his power, that he could thus save a drowning man, and his pity, that he would thus save one who was running from him, and had offended him. It was of the Lord's mercies that Jonah was not consumed. Jonah was alive in the fish three days and nights: to nature this was impossible, but to the God of nature all things are possible. Jonah, by this miraculous preservation, was made a type of Christ; as our blessed Lord himself declared, Mt 12:40.</body></html>
