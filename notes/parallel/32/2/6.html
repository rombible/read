The metaphor of a gateway to <span class= "ital">sheol</span> is common (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm" title="I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.">Isaiah 38:10</a>, &c.), but the earth is nowhere else said to be so guarded. Ewald therefore proposes to read <span class= "ital">sheol</span> here. But it is quite as natural to imagine a guarded passage out of the land of the living as into the land of the dead.<p><span class= "bld">Corruption.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">pit.</span> (See Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The bottoms of the mountains;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the cuttings off</span>, where the mountains seem to be cut off by the ocean floor; the roots of the mountains. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the clefts of the mountains" (Sop-tuagint); <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The earth with her bars</span>; as <span class="accented">for the earth, her bars were about me</span>; return to it was shut out for me; the gate by which I might return was locked behind me.

Jerome refers the word to the digestive process in the fish's stomach; it is probably merely a synonym for "death." The marginal rendering, "the pit," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Sheol, is also etymologically correct (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My God.</span> He thankfully acknowledges that Jehovah has proved himself a beneficent God to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Observe when Jonah prayed. When he was in trouble, under the tokens of God's displeasure against him for sin: when we are in affliction we must pray. Being kept alive by miracle, he prayed. A sense of God's good-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, opens the lips in prayer, which were closed with the dread of wrath. Also, where he prayed; in the belly of the fish. No place is amiss for prayer. Men may shut us from communion with one another, but not from communion with God. To whom he prayed; to the Lord his God. This encourages even backsliders to return. What his prayer was. This seems to relate his experience and reflections, then and afterwards, rather than to be the form or substance of his prayer. Jonah reflects on the earnestness of his prayer, and God's readiness to hear and answer. If we would get good by our troubles, we must notice the hand of God in them. He had wickedly fled from the presence of the Lord, who might justly take his Holy Spirit from him, never to visit him more. Those only are miserable, whom God will no longer own and favour. But though he was perplexed, yet not in despair. Jonah reflects on the favour of God to him, when he sought to God, and trusted in him in his distress. He warns others, and tells them to keep close to God. Those who forsake their own duty, forsake their own mercy; those who run away from the work of their place and day, run away from the comfort of it. As far as a believer copies those who observe lying vanities, he forsakes his own mercy, and lives below his privileges. But Jonah's experience encourages others, in all ages, to trust in God, as the God of salvation.</body></html>
