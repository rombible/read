(For the attitude see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm" title="Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your holy oracle.">Psalm 28:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Jonah confesses that he at first fully expected death; but faith and hope soon triumphed over despondency. <span class="cmt_word">I am cast out of thy sight.</span> This was his thought when what is mentioned in ver. 3 happened unto him. The words are a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a>, altered somewhat to suit Jonah's circumstances. The psalmist says, "I said in my haste." Jonah says simply, "I said," without any limitation; and for "I am cut off," Jonah uses, "I am cast out." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - a strong term, implying banishment with violence. <span class="accented">Out of thy sight</span>; literally, <span class="accented">frown before thine eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from thy protecting care (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-24.htm">1 Samuel 26:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). He who had fled from the presence of the Lord in Canaan fears that he has forfeited the favour of God. <span class="cmt_word">Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</span> I will turn in prayer to that holy place where thou dost manifest thy presence. The Jews were wont to turn towards Jerusalem when they prayed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>). Some think that Jonah expresses a hope of worshipping again in the temple; but the turn of expression in the text hardly warrants this. Others refer the term to the heavenly temple, as they do in ver. 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Observe when Jonah prayed. When he was in trouble, under the tokens of God's displeasure against him for sin: when we are in affliction we must pray. Being kept alive by miracle, he prayed. A sense of God's good-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, opens the lips in prayer, which were closed with the dread of wrath. Also, where he prayed; in the belly of the fish. No place is amiss for prayer. Men may shut us from communion with one another, but not from communion with God. To whom he prayed; to the Lord his God. This encourages even backsliders to return. What his prayer was. This seems to relate his experience and reflections, then and afterwards, rather than to be the form or substance of his prayer. Jonah reflects on the earnestness of his prayer, and God's readiness to hear and answer. If we would get good by our troubles, we must notice the hand of God in them. He had wickedly fled from the presence of the Lord, who might justly take his Holy Spirit from him, never to visit him more. Those only are miserable, whom God will no longer own and favour. But though he was perplexed, yet not in despair. Jonah reflects on the favour of God to him, when he sought to God, and trusted in him in his distress. He warns others, and tells them to keep close to God. Those who forsake their own duty, forsake their own mercy; those who run away from the work of their place and day, run away from the comfort of it. As far as a believer copies those who observe lying vanities, he forsakes his own mercy, and lives below his privileges. But Jonah's experience encourages others, in all ages, to trust in God, as the God of salvation.</body></html>
