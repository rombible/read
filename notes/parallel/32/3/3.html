In the Hebrew poetic and prophetic writings a finer form is found, <span class= "ital">e.g</span>., "mountains of God," "cedars of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>), "trees of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-16.htm" title="The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;">Psalm 104:16</a>), but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.">Genesis 10:9</a> a precisely similar proverbial use shows itself, also belonging to the Mesopotamian region, "Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord."<p><span class= "bld">Of three days' journey.</span>--Hitzig takes this as giving the diameter of the city, but most commentators refer it to the circumference. The circuit of the walls was the most obvious measurement to give of an ancient city. Herodotus variously reckons a day's journey at about eighteen or twenty-three miles (v. 53, iv. 101), and the circuit of the irregular quadrangle composed of the mounds of Koujunjik, Nimrud, Karamless, and Khorsabad, now generally allowed to represent ancient Nineveh, is about sixty miles. This agrees sufficiently with the obviously vague and general statement of the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arose, and went.</span> He was now as prompt to obey as formerly to flee. <span class="cmt_word">Was</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when Jonah visited it. Nothing can be argued from the past tense here as to the date of the composition of the book.

So Nimrod is called (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>) "a mighty hunter before the Lord;" and Moses, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>, is said to have been" beautiful to God." The expression may also mean that God (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>, God as Governor of the world) regarded this city with interest, as intended in the Divine counsels to perform an important part. For he is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of three days' journey;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in circumference - about sixty miles (see note on Jonah 1:2). Or the writer may mean that it took Jonah three days to visit the various quarters of this huge place. The area of the vast quadrangle containing the remains of the four cities comprised under the name <span class="accented">Nineveh</span> is estimated by Professor Rawlinson at two hundred and sixteen square miles. We ought, however, to omit Khorsabad from this computation, as it was not founded till Sargon's time, <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 God employs Jonah again in his service. His making use of us is an evidence of his being at peace with us. Jonah was not disobedient, as he had been. He neither endeavoured to avoid hearing the command, nor declined to obey it. See here the nature of repentance; it is the change of our mind and way, and a return to our work and duty. Also, the benefit of affliction; it brings those back to their place who had deserted it. See the power of Divine grace, for affliction of itself would rather drive men from God, than draw them to him. God's servants must go where he sends them, come when he calls them, and do what he bids them; we must do whatever the word of the Lord commands. Jonah faithfully and boldly delivered his errand. Whether Jonah said more, to show the anger of God against them, or whether he only repeated these words again and again, is not certain, but this was the purport of his message. Forty days is a long time for a righteous God to delay judgments, yet it is but a little time for an unrighteous people to repent and reform in. And should it not awaken us to get ready for death, to consider that we cannot be so sure that we shall live forty days, as Nineveh then was that it should stand forty days? We should be alarmed if we were sure not to live a month, yet we are careless though we are not sure to live a day.</body></html>
