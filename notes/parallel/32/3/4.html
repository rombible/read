The writer has no thought of furnishing data for ascertaining the exact dimensions of Nineveh, but only of producing a general sense of its vast size.<p><span class= "bld">Yet forty days.</span>--The conciseness of the original, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh overthrown," forcibly expresses "the one deep cry of woe" which the prophet was commissioned to utter. "This simple message of Jonah bears an analogy to what we find elsewhere in Holy Scripture. The great preacher of repentance, St. John the Baptist, repeated doubtless oftentimes that one cry, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Our Lord vouchsafed to begin His own office with those self-same words. And probably, among the civilised but savage inhabitants of Nineveh that one cry was more impressive than any other would have been, Simplicity is always impressive. They were four words which God caused to be written on the wall amid Belshazzar's impious revelry: <span class= "ital">Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin.</span> We all remember the touching history of Jesus, son of Anan, an unlettered rustic, who, "four years before the war, when Jerusalem was in complete peace and affluence," burst in on the people at the Feast of Tabernacles with the oft-repeated cry, "A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice on Jerusalem and the Temple, a voice on the bridegrooms and the brides, a voice on the whole people;" how he went about through all the lanes of the city, repeating, day and night, this one cry, and when scourged till his bones were laid bare, echoed every lash with "Woe, woe, to Jerusalem!" and continued as his daily dirge and his one response to daily good or ill treatment, "Woe, woe, to Jerusalem!" (Pusey.) Instead of "forty days" the LXX. read "three."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">Jonah, undeterred by the danger of the enterprise, executes his mission at one, and announces the approaching destruction of the city. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Began to enter into the city a day's journey.</span> Jonah commenced his day's journey in the city, and, as he found a suitable place, uttered his warning cry, not necessarily continuing in one straight course, but going to the most frequented spots. At the time of Jonah's preaching the royal residence was probably at Chalah: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nimrud, the most southern of the cities. Coming from Palestine, he would reach this part first, so that his strange message would soon come to the king's ears (ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">Yet forty days.</span> "Forty" in Scripture is the number of probation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "yet three days" owing probably to some clerical error, as writing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;</span>. St. Augustine ('De Civit.,' 18:44) endeavours to explain the discrepaney mystically as referring to Christ under different circumstances, as being the same who remained forty days on earth after his resurrection, and who rose again on the third day. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be overthrown.</span> This is the word used for the destruction of Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>). The prophet appears to have gone on through the city, repeating this one awful announcement, as we read of fanatics denouncing woe on Jerusalem before its final destruction (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:05. 3). The threat was conditional virtually, though expressed in uncompromising terms. In the Hebrew the participle is used, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh overthrown," as though he saw at the end of the specified time the great city lying in ruins. One sees from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-11.htm">Isaiah 36:11, 13</a>, that Jonah could readily be understood by the Assyrians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 God employs Jonah again in his service. His making use of us is an evidence of his being at peace with us. Jonah was not disobedient, as he had been. He neither endeavoured to avoid hearing the command, nor declined to obey it. See here the nature of repentance; it is the change of our mind and way, and a return to our work and duty. Also, the benefit of affliction; it brings those back to their place who had deserted it. See the power of Divine grace, for affliction of itself would rather drive men from God, than draw them to him. God's servants must go where he sends them, come when he calls them, and do what he bids them; we must do whatever the word of the Lord commands. Jonah faithfully and boldly delivered his errand. Whether Jonah said more, to show the anger of God against them, or whether he only repeated these words again and again, is not certain, but this was the purport of his message. Forty days is a long time for a righteous God to delay judgments, yet it is but a little time for an unrighteous people to repent and reform in. And should it not awaken us to get ready for death, to consider that we cannot be so sure that we shall live forty days, as Nineveh then was that it should stand forty days? We should be alarmed if we were sure not to live a month, yet we are careless though we are not sure to live a day.</body></html>
