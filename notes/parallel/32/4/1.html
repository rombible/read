Selfish jealousy for his own reputation, jealousy for the honour of the prophetic office, a mistaken patriotism disappointed that the great enemy of his country should go unpunished, Jewish exclusiveness which could not endure to see the Divine clemency extended to the heathen, have each been adduced as the motive of Jonah's anger. Possibly something of all these blended in his mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - JONAH'S DISPLEASURE AND ITS CORRECTION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">Jonah</span> is <span class="accented">grieved</span> <span class="accented">at the sparing of Nineveh, the expectation of which had led to his former flight, and complains of God's clemency.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It displeased Jonah exceedingly;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it was evil to Jonah, a great evil.</span> It was more than mere displeasure which he felt; he was vexed and irritated. The reference is to what is said in the last verse of the preceding chapter, viz. that the predicted destruction was not inflicted. How the knowledge of this reprieve was conveyed to the prophet we am not informed. It probably was made known to him before the expiration of the forty days by Divine communication, in accordance with the saying in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (see ver. 5). Various reasons have been assigned for this displeasure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Personal pique, lest, his prediction having failed, he should be liable to the charge of being a false prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Zeal for the honour of God, whose knowledge of the future might be discredited among the heathen, when they saw his own servant's words unfulfilled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because he saw in this conversion of Gentiles a token of the ruin of his own people, who remained always hardened and impenitent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> A mistaken patriotism, which could not endure to find mercy extended to a heathen nation which had already proved hostile to Israel and was destined to oppress it still further. This last seem to have been the real ground of his annoyance. So deep was this, that he would gladly have seen the sentence executed even after the city had repented (comp. ver. 11, "Should not I spare Nineveh," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which thou wouldst have me even now destroy?) <span class="cmt_word">He was very angry</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "was confounded." His vexation increased unto anger. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-4 What all the saints make matter of joy and praise, Jonah makes the subject of reflection upon God; as if showing mercy were an imperfection of the Divine nature, which is the greatest glory of it. It is to his sparing, pardoning mercy, we all owe it that we are out of hell. He wishes for death: this was the language of folly, passion, and strong corruption. There appeared in Jonah remains of a proud, uncharitable spirit; and that he neither expected nor desired the welfare of the Ninevites, but had only come to declare and witness their destruction. He was not duly humbled for his own sins, and was not willing to trust the Lord with his credit and safety. In this frame of mind, he overlooked the good of which he had been an instrument, and the glory of the Divine mercy. We should often ask ourselves, Is it well to say thus, to do thus? Can I justify it? Do I well to be so soon angry, so often angry, so long angry, and to give others ill language in my anger? Do I well to be angry at the mercy of God to repenting sinners? That was Jonah's crime. Do we do well to be angry at that which is for the glory of God, and the advancement of his kingdom? Let the conversion of sinners, which is the joy of heaven, be our joy, and never our grief.</body></html>
