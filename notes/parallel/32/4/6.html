And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.">Jonah 1:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">A gourd.</span>--So the LXX. render the Hebrew <span class= "ital">qiqaion,</span> which, since the time of Jerome, has been usually identified with the Arabic <span class= "ital">el keroa,</span> the castor-oil tree (<span class= "ital">Ricinus communis,</span> or <span class= "ital">Palma Christi</span>; see margin). It is a large shrub, having large palmate leaves, with serrated lobes, and spikes of blossoms which produce the seed, whence the well-known medicinal oil is extracted, in small rough husks. The strongest argument in favour of this view is the proposed derivation of the Hebrew name from the Egyptian <span class= "ital">kiki,</span> and the rabbinical name for castor-oil, <span class= "ital">kiki-oil.</span><span class= "note">[22]</span> In spite of this etymological argument, Dr. Tristram says: "Practical reasons cause me to lean strongly to the rendering of our English version, gourd, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the bottle gourd (<span class= "ital">Cucurbita pepo</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In Palestine the vernacularnames are almost identical in sound, "kurah" being the gourd, "khurwah" the castor-oil tree. But the gourd is very commonly employed in Palestine for the purpose of shading arbours. Its rapid growth and large leaves render it admirably adapted for training on trellis-work . . . But the plant withers as rapidly as it shoots, and after a storm or any injury to its stem, its fruit may be seen hanging from the leafless tendrils, which so lately concealed it, a type of melancholy desolation" (<span class= "ital">Nat Hist. of the Bible,</span> p. 449).<p><span class= "note">[22] A Semitic origin for the word is rendered probable by its discovery under the form, <span class= "ital">quqanitu,</span> on a small tablet which the Babylonian king <span class= "ital">Marduk-bal-iddin</span> (Merodach-baladan) ordered to be set in a garden. (See letters of Dr. F. Delitzsch, to the <span class= "ital">Athen?um </span>of May 26th and June 9th, 1883.)</span><p><span class= "bld">Made it to come up.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">it came up.</span><p><span class= "bld">Deliver.</span>--In the original there is a play of words on this word and <span class= "ital">shadow.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - 3<span class="accented">.

Jerome describes this as a shrub called in Syriac <span class="accented">elkeroa</span>, and common in the sandy regions of Palestine. It has large leaves and grows to a considerable height in a very few days, so that a mere shrub becomes quickly a small tree. The scientific name of this plant is <span class="accented">Ricinus communis</span>; in Egyptian, <span class="accented">kiki</span>; in Assyrian, <span class="accented">kukanitu.</span> A drawing of it is given in Dr Pusey's 'Commentary,' p 260. It is also known by the name of the <span class="accented">Palma Christi</span>, and from its seeds is expressed "castor oil." But it is very doubtful whether this is the plant intended. Certainly the <span class="accented">ricinus</span> is never used in the East as a protection against the sun, for which its straggling, open growth renders it unsuitable; while the gourd, as Mr. Tristram testifies ('Land of Israel,' p. 37), is used universally to form trellises for shading arbours and summer houses, and affords a most effectual screen. "Orientals," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 15), "never dream of training a castor-oil plant overs booth, or planting it for a shade, and they would have but small respect for any one who did. It is in no way adapted for that purpose, while thousands of arbours are covered with various creepers of the general gourd family." With this testimony it is well to be satisfied. Whatever the plant was, its growth was abnormal in the present ease, though the rapidity with which it developed was merely a quickening of its ordinary powers, in due accordance with its nature and character. From his grief; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "from his evils;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut</span>... <span class="accented">protegeret eum.</span> The Hebrew word is the same as in ver. 1, and it refers, not so much to the physical discomfort occasioned by the heat, but rather to the condition of his mind, the vexation and disappointment under which he was suffering. <span class="cmt_word">We exceeding glad;</span> literally, <span class="accented">rejoiced a great joy</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint). The candour and simplicity of the writer throughout are very remarkable. He may have seen in this providential shelter an intimation that God approved of his intention to wait and see the issue. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:5-11 Jonah went out of the city, yet remained near at hand, as if he expected and desired its overthrow. Those who have fretful, uneasy spirits, often make troubles for themselves, that they may still have something to complain of. See how tender God is of his people in their afflictions, even though they are foolish and froward. A thing small in itself, yet coming seasonably, may be a valuable blessing. A gourd in the right place may do us more service than a cedar. The least creatures may be great plagues, or great comforts, as God is pleased to make them. Persons of strong passions are apt to be cast down with any trifle that crosses them, or to be lifted up with a trifle that pleases them. See what our creature-comforts are, and what we may expect them to be; they are withering things. A small worm at the root destroys a large gourd: our gourds wither, and we know not what is the cause. Perhaps creature-comforts are continued to us, but are made bitter; the creature is continued, but the comfort is gone. God prepared a wind to make Jonah feel the want of the gourd. It is just that those who love to complain, should never be left without something to complain of. When afflicting providences take away relations, possessions, and enjoyments, we must not be angry at God. What should especially silence discontent, is, that when our gourd is gone, our God is not gone. Sin and death are very dreadful, yet Jonah, in his heat, makes light of both. One soul is of more value than the whole world; surely then one soul is of more value than many gourds: we should have more concern for our own and others' precious souls, than for the riches and enjoyments of this world. It is a great encouragement to hope we shall find mercy with the Lord, that he is ready to show mercy. And murmurers shall be made to understand, that how willing soever they are to keep the Divine grace to themselves and those of their own way, there is one Lord over all, who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him. Do we wonder at the forbearance of God towards his perverse servant? Let us study our own hearts and ways; let us not forget our own ingratitude and obstinacy; and let us be astonished at God's patience towards us.</body></html>
