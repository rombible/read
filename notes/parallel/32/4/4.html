Jonah apparently gave his own interpretation to the question, one that suited his mood, "Is thine anger just?" Such a question might imply that the doom of the city was only deferred, and that he had been too hasty in giving up the fulfilment of his prediction. Accordingly he went outside the walls, and sat down to watch what the issue would be. On the other hand, the rendering "Art thou so very angry?" suits best the reply in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-9.htm" title="And God said to Jonah, Do you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.">Jonah 4:9</a>, "I am very angry, even to death." Probably the Hebrew word, like the French <span class= "ital">bien,</span> kept both its original and derived meaning, and must be rendered <span class= "ital">well</span> or <span class= "ital">very,</span> according to the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doest thou well to be angry?</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;</span>; "Hast thou been greatly grieved?" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Putasne bene irasceris tu</span>? The English Version is doubtless correct. God bids him consider with himself whether his anger is reasonable. The version of the LXX., however grammatically permissible, is somewhat pointless. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jonah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-4 What all the saints make matter of joy and praise, Jonah makes the subject of reflection upon God; as if showing mercy were an imperfection of the Divine nature, which is the greatest glory of it. It is to his sparing, pardoning mercy, we all owe it that we are out of hell. He wishes for death: this was the language of folly, passion, and strong corruption. There appeared in Jonah remains of a proud, uncharitable spirit; and that he neither expected nor desired the welfare of the Ninevites, but had only come to declare and witness their destruction. He was not duly humbled for his own sins, and was not willing to trust the Lord with his credit and safety. In this frame of mind, he overlooked the good of which he had been an instrument, and the glory of the Divine mercy. We should often ask ourselves, Is it well to say thus, to do thus? Can I justify it? Do I well to be so soon angry, so often angry, so long angry, and to give others ill language in my anger? Do I well to be angry at the mercy of God to repenting sinners? That was Jonah's crime. Do we do well to be angry at that which is for the glory of God, and the advancement of his kingdom? Let the conversion of sinners, which is the joy of heaven, be our joy, and never our grief.</body></html>
