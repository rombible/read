In one part the prophet sees in vision and shows us pictorially the multitudes of the nations pouring on in one continuous stream into the fatal valley. In another compartment of the picture, Jehovah is seen in the awfulness of his majesty and in the fearfulness of his judgments on the wicked, while he is a Refuge and Strength for his people. <span class="cmt_word">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision.</span> These multitudes are the tumultuous masses. <span class="accented">Hamon</span> is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to be noisy, or tumultuous. "It is identical," says Pusey, "with our ' hum; ' then noise, and, among others, the hum of a multitude, then a multitude even apart from that noise. It is used of the throng of a large army." The repetition emphasizes the masses as <span class="accented">pits</span>, <span class="accented">pits</span>, equivalent to "nothing but pits;" or <span class="accented">ditches</span>, <span class="accented">ditches</span>, equivalent to "full of ditches;" or it expresses diversity, equivalent to "multitudes of the living and multitudes of the dead." <span class="accented">Decision</span> is <span class="accented">charuts</span>, cut, something decided; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> so sharp, <span class="accented">severe judgment</span>, from <span class="accented">chafers</span>, to cut into, sharpen, dig. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others understand it in the sense of a <span class="accented">threshing-wain</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">charuts morag</span>, a sharpened threshing-instrument. All things being now ready, the immediate proximity of the judgment is announced to be at hand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-17 Here is a challenge to all the enemies of God's people. There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.</body></html>
