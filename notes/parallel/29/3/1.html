Then will be "the times of the restitution of all things;" then will the people of God be brought out of captivity, and vengeance executed upon their enemies. This progress, with its final consummation, is the subject of the concluding lines of Joel's prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - These verses describe the deliverance of God's people and the destruction of his enemies because of their injurious, insulting, and ignominious treatment of his people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The <span class="accented">time</span> referred to: <span class="cmt_word">In those days, and in that time</span>, is the first point to be determined. The reference is obviously to the period spoken of in the twenty-eighth verse of the second chapter, where we read, "And it shall come to pass <span class="accented">afterward</span>, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flush." This seems to fix the date at least of the commencement of the events recorded in these verses. These events must have been subsequent to that Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit. But a still closer specification of the time is added by way of apposition, namely (<span class="accented">asher</span> supplemented by <span class="accented">bahem</span> or <span class="accented">bah</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> This form of expression includes, beside the restoration of God's people from their dispersion and redemption out of captivity or distress of any kind, their elevation also to a higher position of dignity and to greater prosperity than they had ever before enjoyed. Thus of Job we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>)," And the Lord turned the captivity of Job... also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before." The <span class="accented">ki</span> which introduces the verse gives assurance that the blessing promised in the concluding verse of the preceding chapter shall be realized; while the <span class="accented">hinneh</span> directs attention to the novelty and importance of the subject introduced in the first verse of this present chapter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The restoration of the Jews, and the final victory of true religion over all opposers, appear to be here foretold. The contempt and scorn with which the Jews have often been treated as a people, and the little value set upon them, are noticed. None ever hardened his heart against God or his church, and prospered long.</body></html>
