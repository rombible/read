The verses now before us describe very graphically the execution of that judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9</span> pictures the proclamation and other preliminaries of war.

Certain formalities of a religious nature were customary among the heathen when war was proclaimed and prepared for. Thus also among the Jews supplication was made and sacrifices offered, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8, 9</a>, that before the battle with the Philistines at Mizpeh, the people urged Samuel to make earnest supplication and sacrifice for them, when in compliance he "took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the Lord: and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel;" and thus a preparation for war was a consecration of war by religious rites. <span class="cmt_word">Wake up the mighty men</span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to Keil, <span class="accented">waken up</span> or <span class="accented">arouse the mighty men.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A preferable rendering, according to Wunsche, is, "Wake up, ye mighty men;" while he understands the whole address as directed to the covenant people. It is observable theft one manuscript has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;</span>, equivalent to "make strong," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heroes. In either case, the heroes may be conceived as enjoying peaceful repose when they are rudely roused by the declaration of war; and as the word "war" is indefinite through the absence of the article, it implies, "What a war! how great and terrible!" <span class="cmt_word">Let all the men of war drew near; let them come up</span>. The terms here used are technical military terms, summoning the warriors to advance and march onward in haste to the place of conflict. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-17 Here is a challenge to all the enemies of God's people. There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.</body></html>
