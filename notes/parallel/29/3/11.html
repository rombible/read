It is rather, <span class="accented">hasten</span>, <span class="accented">and come</span>; the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, only occurring here, being equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "hasten ye." The LXX. and Chaldee, indeed, favour the sense of "assemble;" the former has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>. But that idea is expressed afterwards by the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which is an anomalous form of the imperative Niph. for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;</span>, though some take it for the perfect with <span class="accented">vau consec.</span> The word <span class="accented">hanchath</span> is usually and properly taken as the imperative Hiph., from <span class="accented">nachath</span>, to come down, the <span class="accented">pathach</span> taking the place of <span class="accented">tzere</span> on account of the guttural and the <span class="accented">nun</span> retained without assimilation, as the <span class="accented">nun</span> rarely falls away in verbs that have a guttural for their second stem-letter. The meaning <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> then, is, "Assemble yourselves." The margin, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> however, has, "The Lord shall bring down," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cause to succumb, destroy, "thy mighty ones," which must then signify "the mighty ones of the enemy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This, though supported by the Chaldee, Syriac, Vulgate, and Jerome, is less simple and obvious, necessitating also a corresponding change of the verbal form into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>. The LXX. rendering is peculiar, and as follows: "Let the meek become a warrior." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:9-17 Here is a challenge to all the enemies of God's people. There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.</body></html>
