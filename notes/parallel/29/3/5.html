This was at once the climax of their cruelty and the aggravation of their crime. The object which their enemies had in view in selling the Hebrew captives to the sons of Javan, or Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor, was by that remote exile to prevent the possibility of their return to their own land. The historic reference is thought by some to be the event narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16, 17</a>, where it is written, "The Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines...

The contempt and scorn with which the Jews have often been treated as a people, and the little value set upon them, are noticed. None ever hardened his heart against God or his church, and prospered long.</body></html>
