From this latter signification is derived the word for morning--dawn; from the former comes the word "blackness," which gives the name <span class= "ital">Sihor</span> to the Nile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm" title="And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.">Isaiah 23:3</a>). It seems accordingly more in harmony with the present context to take the sense of the word in its reference to blackness, and to understand it as indicating a thick, dark, rolling cloud settled upon the mountain top. The description following comprehends equally the natural and political locusts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A day of darkness and of glooming, a day of clouds and of thick darkness.</span> It was, indeed, a day of Divine judgment, a day of sore distress. Besides the common terms for "darkness" and "cloud," there are two other terms, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, thick and dense darkness, such as ensues after sunset; the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, though not used in the Hebrew, is cognate with the Arabic <span class="accented">afala</span>, properly, to "set as the sun:" compare <span class="accented">naphal</span>, <span class="accented">nabhal</span>, <span class="accented">abhal</span>; while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> is blended from the triliterals <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;</span>, a cloud, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to be dark (compare <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>), darkness of donas, thick clouds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some understand this darkness literally, as in the description of the plague of locusts in Egypt it is written, "They covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others understand it figuratively, as light denotes prosperity, and darkness adversity. Thus Kimchi says, "Affliction is likened to darkness, as joy is likened to light." At the same time, he mentions the literal exposition: "Or," he says, "through the multitude of the locusts the land is darkened;" and refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>, "For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened." <span class="cmt_word">As the morning spread upon the mountains</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some explain this of the locust-army stretching far like the morning light, as it breaks over the hills. Thus Pococke, "If <span class="accented">shachar</span> be rendered, as most generally, the <span class="accented">morning</span>, and the light thereof meant, then the meaning thereof seems to express the sudden coming and the widespreading of the thing spoken of, so as not to be hindered, in that resembling the morning light, which in a moment discovers itself on the tops of the mountains (on which it first appeareth), though at never so great a distance one from another." The wide and quick <span class="accented">diffusion of this plague</span>, like that of the morning light, is the thing meant. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Keil understands <span class="accented">shachar</span> of the yellow light which proceeds from swarms of locusts as they approach, and translates, "Like morning dawn spread over the mountains is it" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the glimmer on their wings). "The prophet's meaning," he adds, "is evident enough from what follows. He clearly refers to the bright glimmer, or splendour, which is seen in the sky as a swarm of locusts approaches, from the reflection of the sun's rays from their wings." Thus the subject is neither <span class="accented">yom</span> nor '<span class="accented">am</span>, which the Vulgate, contrary to the accents, joins to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Others. again, connect the expression closely with the "darkness" preceding, and translate, "Like the morning twilight spread upon the mountains," that is, before it descends into the valleys. Rather, as Wunsche, "Like the <span class="accented">gray</span> of the morning," etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). Exposition <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is confirmed by Rashi, who says, "The locusts and the palmer-worms are spread over the mountains, as the morning dawn is spread through (in) an the world." Similarly Aben Ezra, "Like the dawn which is diffused in an instant." Kimchi's comment is fuller, but to the same effect: "As the morning dawn which is spread over the mountains as in an instant, for there is called the beginning of the sun in his going forth, because of their height; so then the locusts are spread and extended over the land in an instant." With this exposition of the clause we may compare Virgil's - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Postera vix summos spargebat lumine montes<br />Orta dies."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The following daybreak had scarce begun<br />to sow the mountain-tops with light."</span> <span class="cmt_word">There hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.</span> This is a hyperbolic mode of speech, to denote the extraordinary and unusual severity of the disaster. The Hebrew commentators are at pains to reconcile what appears to them a discrepancy. They say, "It was never known before or since that <span class="accented">four</span> kinds of locusts came to-together;" as for the plague of Egypt;there was but one sort of them, they say. The correct explanation is that the like had not been in the <span class="accented">same</span> country, that is, the land of Judaea, though elsewhere there might have been the like, as in Egypt before, or in other countries since. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-14 The priests were to alarm the people with the near approach of the Divine judgments. It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.</body></html>
