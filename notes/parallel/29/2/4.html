They arc said to resemble horses in the <span class="accented">shape of the head</span>; hence the Germans call them <span class="accented">Heupferde</span>, or hay-horses, and the Italians <span class="accented">cavalette.</span> This resemblance had been noticed long ago by Theodoret, who says, "If any one should examine accurately the head of the locust, he <span class="cmt_word">will find it exceedingly like that of a horse." And</span> as horsemen, so shall they run. In <span class="accented">rapidity</span> of motion they resembled running horses (<span class="accented">parashim</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap</span>. This is the next circumstance noticed about them, viz. the <span class="accented">noise</span> of their motion. Their motion was peculiar; it was springing or leaping, and, when they sprang or leaped, the noise they made resembled the rattling of a jerky two-wheeled war-chariot over a rough mountain-road. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-14 The priests were to alarm the people with the near approach of the Divine judgments. It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.</body></html>
