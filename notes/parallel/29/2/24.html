Ver. 2i presents a contrast to vers. 10-12 of ch. 1; while the promise of corn and wine and oil in ver. 19, with which the present is closely connected, is performed. The perfects exhibit the Divine promise as actually accomplished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5e8;</span>, to separate, denotes the pure grain separated from the husk or chaff and straw. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span> is" to run," and in Hiph.," to cause to run" as of fluids, then overflow; and Pilel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>, <span class="accented">shoqeq</span>, "to cause to overflow." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;</span>, is a vessel bored or hewn out, then the vat into which the wine trodden out in the wine-press, or the oil trodden out in the oil-press, flows; while <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d7;</span> is the press in which wine or oil, especially the former, is trodden out. <span class="cmt_word">I will restore to you the years</span>. This denotes either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the greatness and violence of the destruction made by the locusts, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it implies that, only for the timely interposition of Jehovah in destroying the locusts, the people would have had to sustain the loss of the harvest, not of one year only, but of several - in other words, the disastrous effects of their ravages would have been felt for a number of years; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> not that the locusts invaded the land several successive yours. The absence of the copula before <span class="accented">yeleq</span>, and its presence before the last two names, viz. <span class="accented">ehasil</span> aud <span class="accented">gazam</span>, prove that these three names, being thus co-ordinated, are either epithets or species of '<span class="accented">arbeh</span>: thus, the losses of the years which the locust, or multitudinous one, hath eaten - the licker and the devourer and the biter (or gnawer) - were compensated. Abarbauel maintains these names of the locusts to refer to the four world-powers that one after another desolated Palestine: "For they," he says, "were the army of Jehovah and the messengers of his providence to punish Israel by their means." The effect of the plentiful supply of their wants and of the full satisfaction enjoyed thereby becomes the occasion of devout acknowledgment of God as their Protector and Patron, and of the warmest expressions of gratitude for his goodness, so they <span class="cmt_word">praise the Name of the Lord their God, that had dealt wondrously with them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">had acted towards them even to the doing of wonders.</span> Then follows the practical conclusion, very poetically expressed, and comprising the assurance of the presence of God among his people, his sole Divinity and sure protection of them, a guarantee of his grace to them at all times, freedom from reproach and shame evermore. Thus closes the promise of temporal or material bless-tugs. "Ye shall recognize," says Kimchi, #that I am in your midst, hearing your cries." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-27 The priests and rulers are to appoint a solemn fast. The sinner's supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succour his people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God would spare them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to the prayers of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Some understand these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace, and as fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers in the covenant of grace.</body></html>
