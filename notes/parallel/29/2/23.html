The possibility of the interpretation of "the former rain moderately" out of the Hebrew words by a "teacher of righteousness," as in the Vulg. and in our margin, has led to the connection of this passage with a prophetic intimation of the advent of the Messiah.<p><span class= "bld">In the first month.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">as at first, as before.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God.</span> They had keenly felt and deeply bewailed the unparalleled catastrophe which had befallen laud and cattle and inhabitants, and also themselves among the number. The sons of Zion are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the capital, in which was the national sanctuary for the worship of Jehovah. Not only are the inhabitants of Jerusalem included, but, as the capital often stood for the whole country, all the inhabitants of Judah are comprehended under the "children of Zion." The ground of their gladness and joy in God is: <span class="cmt_word">For he hath given you the former rain moderately</span> (margin, <span class="accented">a teacher of righteousness</span>, or <span class="accented">for righteousness</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month</span>. Omitting for the present the disputed word <span class="accented">hammoreh</span>, we have the great blessing which was so much needed. The blessing bestowed was twofold - negative in the destruction of the locusts and deliverance from their ravages; and positive in the plentiful rainfall, <span class="accented">geshem</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> great and beneficent fertilizer of the dried-up and desolated land. But this abundant rain is more closely particularized as the early or October rain, <span class="accented">moreh</span>, which, falling at the seed-time in autumn, promoted the germination and growth of the seed just sown; and as the latter, or March rain, <span class="accented">malqosh</span>, which, bestowed in the spring season a short time before harvest, matured the crops. The <span class="accented">geshem</span>, or shower, may be regarded here as the generic name, and of these the two species are the <span class="accented">moreh</span> and <span class="accented">malqosh</span>, from <span class="accented">laqash</span>, to be ripe or late, just explained. The word <span class="accented">hammoreh</span> in the early part of the verse is translated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "teacher" in the Chaldee and Vulgate, by Jerome, by Abar-banel among the Hebrew commentators, who refers it to Messiah; among modern commentators by Hofman, referring it to Joel himself, by Hengstenberg, who understands it of the ideal teacher or collective body of messengers from God. Keil also renders, "the teacher for righteousness," and applies the expression to the instructions of Moses, the priests, and the prophets, not excluding Messiah himself. He also understands the prophet to speak of both spiritual and material blessings, giving a fuller exposition of the latter in vers. 23-27, and of the former in vers. 28-32 and in the last chapter. The two considerations that seem to have most weight with Keil in inclining him to this exposition arc the presence of the article with <span class="accented">moreh</span>, and the non-physical sense of <span class="accented">litsdaqah</span>; hence Ewald's "rain for righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a sign from God of their being adopted again into righteousness. But weight-stones and scales have <span class="accented">tsedeq</span> attached in the physical sense of correctness, while ethical rightness is only an inference or subordinate notion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>). The translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of "rain" is, we think, justly entitled to the preference from the context. Among promises of repairing the damage done by the locusts, it would be obviously out of place to introduce the notion of "a teacher." Of the Hebrew expositors, Aben Ezra and Kimchi both understand the word in the sense of rain; the former says, "In my opinion it is the same as <span class="accented">yoreh</span>;" and the latter, "<span class="accented">Hammoreh</span> is the same as <span class="accented">yoreh."</span> So also Calvin, Rosenmuller, Hitzig, and Wunsche. The etymology also is favourable to this view, for both <span class="accented">yoreh</span> and <span class="accented">moreh</span> are from the verb <span class="accented">yorah</span>, to throw (Hiph., cause to throw), throw down as drops, wet, besprinkle, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e7;</span>, and as the Qal and Hiph. sometimes coincide in meaning, we may safely conclude <span class="accented">moreh</span> synonymous with <span class="accented">yoreh</span>, the meaning of which is unquestionably "rain," specially <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. (<span class="accented">a</span>) Rain in right measure, then, we take to be the true meaning; not (<span class="accented">b</span>) rain according to righteousness, as though God, in accordance with his righteousness, repented of the evil he thought to do unto them, and, in consequence of their forsaking their sins, sent the fertilizing rains. Again, <span class="accented">barishon</span> is rendered by some (<span class="accented">a</span>) as if keba-<span class="accented">rishon</span> were equivalent to "as in the former time;" thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicuti in principio.</span> But we prefer (<span class="accented">b</span>) the rendering, "in the first month;" so the Chaldee, "In the month Nisan, or March." The Hebrew commentators explain it in like manner; thus Rashi, "In the first month - in Nisan;" Aben Ezra, "And the meaning of 'in the first' is in the first month;" Kimchi, "The explanation of the rain that is called <span class="accented">moreb</span>, he sends it down to you in its season, which is <span class="accented">Marchesvan</span> (or October), and he causes to descend to you in like manner the <span class="accented">malqosh</span> (the latter rain) in its season in the first month, which is Nisan." The blessing of the rain was thus greatly enhanced by being sent in the right measure and at the suitable season. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-27 The priests and rulers are to appoint a solemn fast. The sinner's supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succour his people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God would spare them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to the prayers of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Some understand these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace, and as fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers in the covenant of grace.</body></html>
