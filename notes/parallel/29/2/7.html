They appear on the mountains which environ the city, they mount the walls, they rush through the streets, they enter the houses, they are in possession of Jerusalem. Dr. Thomson (<span class= "ital">The Land and the Book,</span> p. 416) describes the movements of a locust army in the following terms:--"Their number was astounding; the whole face of the mountain was black with them. On they came, like a living deluge. We dug trenches, and kindled fires, and beat and burned to death heaps upon heaps; but the effort was utterly useless. Wave after wave rolled up the mountain-side, and poured over rocks, walls, ditches, hedges--those behind covering up and bridging over the masses already killed."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - The prophet, having mentioned the consternation and terror occasioned by the approach of locusts, proceeds to compare them to an army well equipped and overcoming all impediments. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall run like mighty men</span>. This either refers to their extreme nimbleness or rapidity of motion (compare the Homeric <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3ba;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and the like), or describes their running to an assault with intrepid valour and unwearied vigour. <span class="cmt_word">They shall climb the wall like men of war</span>. This marks the success of their assault; they scale the walls and make good their attack. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks</span>. Their march is as irresistible as it is orderly. In their onward march each pursues his way, allowing no obstacle to arrest or retard his course; while in a collective body they proceed and maintain their serried ranks unbroken. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is probably cognate with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;</span>, to twist, and thus to turn aside. Thus the LXX.: "They shall not turn aside their tracks;" so also the Syriac and Jerome translate it; but the Chaldee compares it with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d8;</span>, a pledge, and, as the deposit is detained till the pledge is redeemed, takes in the meaning of delay. Rosenmuller explains it in the sense of change or exchange, from the Qal, signifying "to receive on loan," and the Hiph., "to give on loan." Otherwise it is to "interweave" (equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;</span>), "change." The sense of the whole is their not diverging to either side, nor straggling out of rank. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-14 The priests were to alarm the people with the near approach of the Divine judgments. It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.</body></html>
