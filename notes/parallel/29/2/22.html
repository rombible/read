The dumb animals had groaned in distress for food, but now they too have cause to rejoice, and are here called on to do so; and the suitable cause in their case is also specified. It is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">For the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength</span>. He thus specifies the ground of gladness in their case also, pointing to the fresh green of the pastures and the fruit hanging in rich abundance and variety on the trees. The fruits of vines and fig trees are net, it is true, the food of the beasts of the fields; but the revival of vegetation in trees, the higher and larger growths, the chief factor in which is moisture, comprehends the revival of the smaller growths of herbs, grasses, and plants, the proper sustenance of cattle. Kimchi's explanation is that "as the tree bears its fruit in the inhabited part of the world, so in the wilderness the places of pasture grow green." Aben Ezra, who never loses an opportunity of directing attention to contrasts wherever they exist, contrasts "Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field," in this verse with "the beasts of the field cry also unto thee" at the close of the preceding chapter; also "the pastures of the wilderness do spring" with "the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness;" likewise "the tree beareth her fruit" with "all the trees of the field are withered." It has been observed that all plants, even shrubs and trees, spring up at the first as the fresh young juicy green of plants, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>; then they develop into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, grass: into herb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>; and into tree, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> is not the plural for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, but singular, after the analogy of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-12.htm">Psalm 96:12</a>). <span class="accented">Nasaperi</span>, equivalent to "lift up, bear," is more poetical than <span class="accented">asah peri</span>, equivalent to "make fruit;" so in Latin, <span class="accented">surgunt fruges.</span> The expression, "yield their strength," puts the cause for the effect; the strength of the tree produces the fruit and centres in it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-27 The priests and rulers are to appoint a solemn fast. The sinner's supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succour his people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God would spare them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to the prayers of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Some understand these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace, and as fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers in the covenant of grace.</body></html>
