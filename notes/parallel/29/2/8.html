they shall walk every one in his path</span>. "And not one shall stand aloof from his brother." This is either the sequence of their not breaking rank, or perhaps it is a co-ordinate particular in the detail. They neither straggle away from each other, and so fall out of rank, nor do they crowd and crush and press each other while keeping rank. The order of their march is perfect, every one keeping his proper place and in the proper path. <span class="cmt_word">And when they fall upon the sword</span> (margin, <span class="accented">dart</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they shall not be wounded</span>. The meaning is either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the weapons shall not wound them, or intransitively, as in the text, they shall not be wounded, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5e2;</span>, to cut, or break in pieces, being here synonymous with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e6;&#x5e2;</span>, to wound; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that they do not cut off, break off, or interrupt their course. No force of arms can stay their progress or step their advance. On this clause Kimchi remarks, "This army is not like other enemies, which you may hinder by the sword from coming upon you; but these light upon the swords, and are not wounded by reason of their lightness? He also remarks on <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, "Because he compares them with men and heroes, he uses <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, although this word does not apply except to the sons of men." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-14 The priests were to alarm the people with the near approach of the Divine judgments. It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.</body></html>
