The Lord's answer comes in the shape of a promise of relief of which man and beast were so sorely in need. The promise, with deliverance from distress, couples ample abundance. The corn and the wine and the oil - the three great temporal blessings, equivalent to food, refreshment, and ornament - which the locusts had destroyed, as we read in ver. 10, God here promises to restore, and to restore not merely to the extent that was barely necessary, but in full and abundant measure, so that they would be satisfied therewith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The verbs of <span class="accented">fulness</span> or <span class="accented">want</span>, <span class="accented">clothing</span> and <span class="accented">unclothing</span>, <span class="accented">going</span> or <span class="accented">coming</span> and <span class="accented">dwelling</span>, govern an accusative; hence <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;</span> has the accusative here; sometimes it is constructed with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There are two constructions of a participle with a pronoun as subject - that in which the pronoun is written in its separate form in immediate connection with the participle, and that in which it is appended as a suffix. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words <span class="accented">dagan</span> from <span class="accented">dagah</span>, to multiply; <span class="accented">yitshar</span> from <span class="accented">tsahar</span>, to shine; and <span class="accented">tirosh</span> from <span class="accented">yarash</span>, to take possession of the brain, have each the article prefixed, to emphasize the products restored by the Divine mercy. The article, no doubt, is prefixed to the names of classes of objects generally known. <span class="cmt_word">And I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen</span>. No more would they be a reproach or byword among the heathen, sneered at, as though God had abandoned them in his sore displeasure, or through sheer impotence had been unable to help them. All this God promised to do in answer to the prayers of his people. Such was the result of penitence, and such the power of prayer. <span class="accented">Cherpath</span> is a second accusative, or, more correctly, an appositional accusative to <span class="accented">ethkem.</span> The construction with <span class="accented">le</span> frequently takes the place of the second accusative, as in the seventeenth verse of the same chapter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-27 The priests and rulers are to appoint a solemn fast. The sinner's supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succour his people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God would spare them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to the prayers of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Some understand these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace, and as fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers in the covenant of grace.</body></html>
