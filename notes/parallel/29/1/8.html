The drunkards were first called on in the preceding verses to mourn, for the distress came first and nearest to them. But now the priests, the Lord's ministers, mourn; things inanimate, by a touching personification, join in the lamentation - the land mourneth; the husbandmen that till the ground mourn. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The verb here, which is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> imperative feminine; the subject must, of course, correspond. That subject has been variously supplied: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the ground, according to Aben Ezra; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">naphshi</span>, my soul, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the prophet's address to himself; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the daughter of Zion, or virgin daughter of Zion; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the congregation or people of Judah, as suggested in the Chaldee, is the real subject. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, evidently combining two readings, or rather two punctuations, of the same word, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span>, to me, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, lament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The mourning is of the deepest, bitterest kind, like that of a virgin for the husband of her youth. It is either the case of a maiden betrothed to a youthful bridegroom, whom she sincerely loves, but he dies before they are married, and thus, instead of the wedding dress, she puts on the garment of mourning, the sackcloth of rough hair; or she has been married, and her husband, still in youth, is snatched away from her by death, and she is clothed in widow's weeds - in her case real weeds of woe, and outward tokens of sincere, not simulated, sorrow. The expression reminds us of Isaiah's "wife of youth," and of the Homeric expression frequently translated "virgin or youthful spouse," though more correctly "wedded wife." Such is the lamentation to which the people of Judah are called. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-13 All who labour only for the meat that perishes, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their labour. Those that place their happiness in the delights of sense, when deprived of them, or disturbed in the enjoyment, lose their joy; whereas spiritual joy then flourishes more than ever. See what perishing, uncertain things our creature-comforts are. See how we need to live in continual dependence upon God and his providence. See what ruinous work sin makes. As far as poverty occasions the decay of piety, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is a very sore judgment. But how blessed are the awakening judgments of God, in rousing his people and calling home the heart to Christ, and his salvation!</body></html>
