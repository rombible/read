God appropriates to Himself this land on which the trouble was, by His providence, to fall, and in wrath remembers mercy. It is "my vine," "my fig-tree," the people of God's own choice, that were afflicted; and the affliction, however fully deserved, was, to speak as a man, painful to the Lord, "who doth not afflict willingly." Yet the devastation was to be complete. God's pleasant vine was doomed, and the fig-tree was to be cut down.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree</span> (margin, <span class="accented">laid my</span> <span class="accented">fig tree for a barking</span>): <span class="cmt_word">he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white</span>. We have here a detailed description of the destruction and devastation caused by this locust-army in its invasion of the land of Judah. The most valuable and most valued production of that land, the vine and fig tree, are ruined. The vine is laid waste, so that the vineyard becomes a wilderness: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "he has barked the fig tree" (so Jerome, "Ficum meam decorticavit"); or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "he has broken the branches." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> denotes a fragment or something broken, branches broken off, and so the LXX., "hath utterly broken (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>);" while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Aben Ezra explains it, "Like foam on the face of the water, in which there is nothing;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a thing of nought. The locusts, by gnawing, had stripped off the bark, or by their excessive weight had broken off the branches. The next clause, which speaks of <span class="accented">making it clean bare</span>, is explained by the Chaldee of peeling off the bark, but that, according to the first rendering, has been already expressed. It is rather more than this - it is stripping off the leaves and fruits or flowers; the barked or broken branches and twigs of vine and fig tree are then cast away or down to the ground. And all that is left are the whitened branches from which the bark has been stripped off. The casting away or down to the earth may refer to the bark; thus Kimchi: "He removes the bark; and so Jonathan explains, 'He quite removes the bark and casts it away;' and the explanation is that he casts the bark to the earth when he eats the juicy parts between the bark and the wood; or the explanation may be that he eats the rind and casts the vine blossom to the earth, and, lo, it is bared." Some, again, understand it of what is uneatable, and others of the vine itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The most aged could not remember such calamities as were about to take place. Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.</body></html>
