"Behold the desolation!" "Note the cause." The earth is bared by locusts beyond all previous experience. There were different sorts of locusts; as many as ninety have been reckoned. The four names, palmerworm, locust, cankerworm, caterpiller, indicate different swarms of the insect. The first--<span class= "ital">Gazam</span>--points to its voracity; the second--<span class= "ital">Arbeh</span>--its multitude; the third--<span class= "ital">Yelek--</span>its manner of "licking up" the grass like cattle; the fourth--<span class= "ital">Chasil--</span>its destructive effect. The number enumerated, <span class= "ital">four,</span> draws attention to the "four sore judgments" with which Ezekiel was instructed to threaten Jerusalem, and to the four foreign invasions by the Assyrians, Chaldaeans, Macedonians, and Romans.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten</span>. Some interpreters consider, and rightly, we think, that the prophet enumerates in this verse four different species of locusts. The common or general name is <span class="accented">arbeh</span>, from <span class="accented">rabhah</span>, to be many; the <span class="accented">gazam</span>, or palmer-worm, is the <span class="accented">gnawer</span>, or biter, from a root (<span class="accented">guzam</span>) which signifies "to gnaw, bite, or cut off;" the <span class="accented">yeleq</span>, or canker-worm, is the <span class="accented">licker</span>, from <span class="accented">yalaqlaqaq</span>, to lick, or lick off; the <span class="accented">chasil</span>, or caterpillar, is the devourer, from <span class="accented">chasal</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> cut off. Thus we have the locust, or multitudinous one, the gnawer, the licker, and the devourer, either as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> four different species of locust; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the gnawer, licker, and devourer are poetical epithets of the locust, or multitudinous one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These names do not denote the locust <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> at different stages, according to Credner. Nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> can we with propriety understand them allegorically, with Jerome, Cyril, and Theodoret, of the enemies of the Jews, whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Chaldeans, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Medes and Persians, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Macedonians and successors of Alexander, especially Antiochus, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the Romans; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>or the hostile kings, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Shalmaneser, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Antiochus, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the Romans; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>or those other kings, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Tiglath-Pileser, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Shalma-neser, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Sennacherib, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The most celebrated Hebrew commentators understand the passage of locusts in the proper and literal sense. Thus Rashi says, "The palmer-worm locust, cankerworm, and caterpillar are species of locusts; and the prophet prophesies about them that they will come; and they came in those days, and they devoured all the fruit of the trees and every herb of the field." Abon Ezra says, "This the prophet prophesied in reference to the locust which should come to destroy the land. In the days of Moses there was one kind of locust alone, but now, with the <span class="accented">arbeh</span>, there are the <span class="accented">gazam</span> and <span class="accented">yeleq</span> and <span class="accented">chasil</span>, and these three kinds are joined." He also quotes Japhet as saying "that <span class="accented">gazam</span> is equivalent to <span class="accented">gozez</span>, cutting, and the mere is like mere in <span class="accented">chinmam reykam</span>; and <span class="accented">yeleq</span>, that which licks (<span class="accented">yiloq</span>) with its tongue... and <span class="accented">chasil</span> of some signification (<span class="accented">yachsele</span>-<span class="accented">nenu</span>) as shall consume it." In like manner Kimohi gives the derivation of the words as follows: "Some say that <span class="accented">gazam</span> is so called because it cuts (<span class="accented">gozez</span>) the increase; and <span class="accented">arbeh</span>, because it is numerous in species; and <span class="accented">yeleq</span>, because it licks and depastures by licking the herb; and <span class="accented">chasil</span>, became it cuts the whole, from 'And the locust shall consume it' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>)." When, however, Kimchi distributes the comings of the locusts into four separate and successive years, we must reject his interpretation in that respect. He says, "What the <span class="accented">gazam</span> left in the first year, the locust ate in the second year; for the four kinds did not come in one year, but one after another in four years; and he says, ' I will restore to you the years the locust hath eaten.'" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The most aged could not remember such calamities as were about to take place. Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.</body></html>
