The verses before us (vers. 5-7) contain the prophet's appeal to the drunkards. Their sin had not alarmed them; the danger with which their soul was imperilled bad not aroused them; now, however, the heavy visitation that awaited them would affect them more vehemently, touching them more nearly. Deprived of the means of their favourite indulgence, they are urged to awake from their stupid slumber and perilous day-dream. They are summoned to weep, shedding silent but bitter tears, and howl, venting their so,row and disappointment in loud and long lamentation: <span class="cmt_word">Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine!</span> He backs this exhortation by a most cogent and unanswerable reason - because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. The word <span class="accented">asis</span> is explained by Kimchi thus: "Wine is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, and so every kind of drink that goes out (is pressed out) by bruising and treading is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, according to the meaning of the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x5e1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3</a>:21. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The most aged could not remember such calamities as were about to take place. Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.</body></html>
