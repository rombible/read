The verb from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (formed from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>), to be or feel ashamed, or turn pale with shame; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> is "to blush or turn red with shame." It is written defectively, to distinguish it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which occurs in the tenth verse and again in the twelfth, and which is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, to be parched or dried up. Their hope was disappointed through the destruction of their wheat and barley - their most serviceable and valuable cereals; while disappointment of hope causes shame; hence we read of a "hope that maketh not ashamed, because it never disappoints as empty hopes do. <span class="cmt_word">Howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the harley; because the harvest of the field is perished. The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth</span>. There is a transposition here which is a species of the figure <span class="accented">ehiasmus</span>, so called from the form of the Greek letter <span class="accented">chi</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;</span>). The husbandmen are put to shame on account of the destruction of the wheat and barley - the entire failure of their field crops and ruin of their harvest; while the vinedressers have reason to howl because of the loss of their vines and the languishing of their fig trees. The prophet, after particularizing the vine and fig tree, proceeds with the enumeration of other important fruit trees that had perished by the teeth of the locusts. <span class="cmt_word">The pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered</span>. The pomegranate, though abundant in that region, had shared the fate of the fig and vine; even the palm tree, the date palm, though a vigorous tree and little subject to injury, having no juice in the leaves or fresh greenness in the rind, ceased to flourish; and the apple tree - the medicinal apple, as Virgil terms it - suffered in like manner. Nor was it the fruit trees only that were injured; the hardier forest or timber trees - all the trees of the field - shared in the calamity. Thus Jerome represents the prophet as asking, "Why should I speak of the corn, wine, oil, and barley? when even the fruits of the trees have been dried up, the fig trees have languished, with the pomegranate and palm and apple; and all trees, whether fruit-bearing or not, are consumed by the devastating locusts." <span class="cmt_word">Because joy is withered away from the sons of men</span>. This clause is connected by" because" with "howl," the intermediate words being treated parenthetically or passed over. Joy here is either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> literal; while "withered" is figurative, and signifies "has ceased or been taken away;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "joy" is figurative, denoting the means of joy, and" withered" may then be understood literally. The <span class="accented">rain</span>, from, is a pregnant construction, that is, "is withered from" being equivalent to "is withered and <span class="accented">taken away</span> from" the sons of men. Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">Because joy</span> <span class="accented">is withered - is withered</span>, as if he said, 'it has ceased because the products and the fruits are the joy of the sons of men,' and so Jonathan explains it, 'because joy has ceased;' or the meaning of 'withered' may be by way of figure." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-13 All who labour only for the meat that perishes, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their labour. Those that place their happiness in the delights of sense, when deprived of them, or disturbed in the enjoyment, lose their joy; whereas spiritual joy then flourishes more than ever. See what perishing, uncertain things our creature-comforts are. See how we need to live in continual dependence upon God and his providence. See what ruinous work sin makes. As far as poverty occasions the decay of piety, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is a very sore judgment. But how blessed are the awakening judgments of God, in rousing his people and calling home the heart to Christ, and his salvation!</body></html>
