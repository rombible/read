but the word used by Joel is different from that in the Proverbs. He selected a word indicative of <span class= "ital">foreign</span> nations, suggestive of attack, including both the irrational invader and the foreign conqueror. The surpassing strength of the nation is indicated by the extraordinary power of the locust's teeth, compared to that of the lion's jaws. The same comparison is made by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-8.htm" title="And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.">Revelation 9:8</a>): "Their teeth (the locusts) were as the teeth of lions."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without number.</span> The loss of the wine and of the sweet juice of the grape would be a source of genuine sorrow to the drinkers of wine; that loss would be occasioned by the destruction of the vines. In this and the following verse the prophet explains the instrumentality by which that destruction would be brought about. The prophet, fully identifying himself with his countrymen, speaking in their name and as their representative, says "my land." Kimchi understands the suffix to "land," like "my vine" and "my fig tree" in the next verse, as referring either to the prophet himself or to the people of the land; while some refer it to Jehovah, the great Proprietor, who had given the land to his people for their inheritance while they observed his covenant and obeyed his commandments. The locusts ore called a <span class="accented">nation</span>, just as the "ants are a people not strong," and the "conies are" said to be "but a feeble folk." Kimchi lays that "every collection of living things is called a nation (<span class="accented">qoy</span>); accordingly the prophet applies 'nation' to the locust." Nor deem the weed "nation" thus applied support the allegorical sense any more than the Homeric - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Even as go the swarms</span> [<span class="implied">literally nations</span>]<br /><span class="accented">of closely thronging bees."</span> This army of locusts is characterized by the two qualities of strength and number. The preterite <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, though past, really refers to the future, to express the certain occurrence of what is predicted; so with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> in the following verse, of which Kimchi says, "The past is in place of the future;" and Aben Ezra more fully, "A thing that is decreed to take place is spoken of in the past." This army has peculiar weapons, yet nothing the less powerful. <span class="cmt_word">Whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek-teeth of a great lion</span>; or, <span class="accented">lioness.</span> Different descriptive terms are applied to lions - the lion's whelp is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>; the young lion, which, though young, is no longer a whelp, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>; also the lion, from its <span class="accented">hoarseness</span> at a certain age, is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;</span>; the lion, from its cry, is called by onomatopoeia, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>; the lion, from its <span class="accented">strength</span>, is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>; while the common name of a lion, derived probably from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to pluck or tear, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>. Having compared the invading locusts to an army powerful and countless, the prophet proceeds to speak of the weapons wielded by these warlike and hostile invaders. They are their teeth. While the common name for locust respects their multitude, the other names are of the nature of epithets, and all, as we have seen, derived from the vigour and voracity with which they use their teeth. Those teeth, so destructive, are compared to those of a lion and the molars or grinders of a great, stout, old lion or lioness, for the word has been translated in each of these ways. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The most aged could not remember such calamities as were about to take place. Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.</body></html>
