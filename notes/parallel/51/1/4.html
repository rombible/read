"Having heard "more immediately from Epaphras (vers. 8, 9). Note the characteristic recurrence of this word: he <span class="accented">had heard</span> of their faith and love, as they <span class="accented">had heard before</span> the word of truth (ver. 5); <span class="accented">from the day they had heard</span> they had borne fruit (ver. 6), and he, in return,from <span class="accented">the day he heard of it</span>, had not ceased to pray for them (ver. 9); see note on ver. 8; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a> and 1 Thessalonians 2:2 with 1 Thessalonians 3:6 (Greek). <span class="accented">"In</span> Christ Jesus" is attached to <span class="accented">"faith"</span> (as to "brethren" in ver. 2) so closely as to form with it a single idea; to be "in Christ Jesus" is of the very essence of this faith and brotherhood. "Faith in Christ," "believe in Christ," in our English Bible, commonly represent a different Greek preposition, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> (literally, <span class="accented">into</span> or <span class="accented">unto</span> Christ); only in the pastoral Epistles and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a> - not in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26</a> (see Lightfoot) or <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a> (see Meyer or Beet) - do we find, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>. <span class="accented">In Christ</span> faith rests, finding its abiding ground and element of life. In the Epistles of this period the Christian state appears chiefly as "life in Christ;" rather than, as in the earlier letters, as "salvation through Christ" (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). The "love" of the Colossians evokes thanksgiving, as that which they have "toward all the saints;" for as the Church extended Christian love needed to be more catholic (ver. 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), and Colossian error in particular tended to exclusiveness and caste feeling (see note on ver. 28). The iteration of "all" in this Epistle is remarkable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.</body></html>
