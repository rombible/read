In the Ephesian Epistle this declaration is made a direct introduction to practical exhortation (comp. Col. 4, 5, 6); here it leads up to the earnest remonstrance against speculative errors in Colossians 2, which precedes a similar practical exhortation. In both cases he dwells on the committal to him of a special dispensation; in both he rejoices in suffering as a means of spiritual influence; in both cases he declares the one object to be the presentation of each man perfect before Christ.<p>(24) <span class= "bld">Who now rejoice.</span>--In the true reading of the original there is no relative pronoun. The sentence starts with emphatic abruptness, "Now (at this moment) I rejoice" (just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.">2Corinthians 7:9</a>). In all the three Epistles of the Captivity this same rejoicing is declared in himself and urged on his brethren. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>, "I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Philippians 2:11</a>, "Yea, if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. For the same cause do ye also joy, and rejoice with me." There, as here, the rejoicing is in suffering, not in itself, not solely because it is borne with and for Christ, but also because it is for the sake of the Church. Here, however, this idea is expressed with far greater emphasis.<p><span class= "bld">Fill up that which is behind of the afflictions</span> <span class= "bld">of Christ.</span>--The sense of this passage is at first sight startling, but it could not have been thought difficult or doubtful, had not false inferences from it tempted men to shrink from the obvious meaning. Now, (1) the "afflictions of Christ" is a phrase not used elsewhere; for "affliction" (properly, <span class= "ital">hard and galling pressure</span>) is the ordinary burden of life, and is generally spoken of only as coming on His servants. But, like the common phrase "the sufferings of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1Peter 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1</a>), it must moan the afflictions which He endured. It is true, as has been thoughtfully suggested (see Chrysostom and others on the passage) that we are to count as His the afflictions of His Church; but still, even if we are to include these indirect afflictions, we cannot possibly exclude the direct. Next, (2) St. Paul expressly says (in the full force of the original) that "he fills up <span class= "ital">instead"</span> of his Master, what is still left unfinished of his Master's afflictions. (See the passages quoted by Dr. Lightfoot in his note on this verse.) He declares, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that, succeeding to the suffering of Christ, he carries it out for the sake of His body the Church. This is, indeed, nothing but a clearer and more striking expression of the truth conveyed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>, "The sufferings of Christ overflow to us," so that we bear our part, in addition to the full measure which He bore; and even in the commoner expression, to be "partaker of Christ's sufferings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1Peter 4:13</a>), or "to drink of His cup and be baptised with His baptism" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22-23</a>). But, (3) looking to the meaning and use of the word "afflictions," we note that "the afflictions of Christ" must be His sufferings on earth considered simply as a part--though immeasurably the chief part--of the burden of humanity in a sinful world, They represent, not the Cross of Atonement, on which He alone could suffer--and in which any reader of St. Paul must find it absurd to suppose that he would claim the slightest share--but the Cross of struggle against sin even to death, which He expressly bade us "take up if we would follow Him." This He has still left "behind;" this in His strength every one of His servants bears, partly for himself, partly also for others. In the former light St. Paul says, "The world is crucified to me, and I to the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>); in the latter he claims it as his highest privilege "to fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ for His Body which is the Church."<p><span class= "bld">In my flesh for his body's sake.</span>--There is obviously an antithesis here. St. Paul suffers in his natural body for the mystical Body of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-29.</span> - SECTION III.

Here it is further compounded with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> ("over against"), which implies some sort of correspondence - <span class="accented">between defect and supply</span>, say Meyer, Alford, Ellicott; but this is surely contained in the idea of <span class="accented">filling up</span>, whereas <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> bears as a rule, and always in St. Paul, a distinct and pointed reference of its own.

Christ, the Head, had borne his part, now the apostle in turn fills up his part, in the great sum of suffering to be undergone on behalf of the body of Christ (see parallels). The verb being so understood, then, with Lightfoot, we infer that "the afflictions of Christ" (a phrase peculiar. . to this passage). are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Christ's own ministerial sufferings</span>, endured at the hands of men. <span class="accented">Affliction</span> is a common term for all that Christians suffer as being in "this present evil world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). Such suffering is common to the Master and his servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>), and he leaves behind to each his fitting and correspondent share therein. These <span class="accented">afflictions</span> are "the sufferings of the Christ" in their <span class="accented">ministerial</span> as distinguished from their <span class="accented">mediatorial</span> aspect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The latter sense is, however, put on the phrase by Romanist divines, who quote the text in support of the doctrine of the merit of the saints, in contradiction to the uniform teaching of St. Paul and the whole New Testament, that the sacrifice of Christ is the sole meritorious ground of salvation for all men, leaving nothing to <span class="accented">fill up</span> (vers. 20-22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, etc.). It is worthy of note that, unless it be in the Epistle to the Hebrews, St. Paul never uses the words "suffer," "suffering" (much less "affliction") in connection with the atoning sacrifice. He dwells rather on the objective fact itself - "the death," "the cross," "the blood." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The prevailing interpretation (Chrysostom, Augustine, down to Alford, Ellicott) finds here <span class="accented">the afflictions of the Church</span> (including Paul's) <span class="accented">made Christ's by mystic sympathy</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23, 29</a>). But this view identifies Paul's sufferings with his Master's, while he expressly distinguishes them; and the idea, however beautiful in itself, is without Pauline analogy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Meyer holds the afflictions to be <span class="accented">Paul's own afflictions which are Christ's by ethical identity, as</span> belonging to the same class. This approaches (1), but is less simple grammatically, and again confuses the <span class="accented">antithesis</span> involved in the pointed <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Other modifications of this view - <span class="accented">afflictions coming from Christ, on account of Christ</span>, etc. - are less plausible. Dr. Gloag, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 7. pp. 224-236, fully discusses the passage and ably defends (3). <span class="cmt_word">In my flesh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>); for St. Paul's physical nature felt keenly the pangs of imprisonment, the chafing of "these bonds." And thus he puts honour on the despised <span class="accented">flesh</span>, as capable of such high service (see note, ver. 22)<span class="cmt_word">. On behalf of his body, which is the Church</span> (ver. 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). The interests of the Church demanded his sufferings. They are "for you" (Colossian Gentiles); but, in his view, the full possession of the gospel by the Gentiles and the existence of the Church itself were vitally bound up together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). If "Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for her" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>), he might well in his turn suffer on the same account. The magnitude of the interests involved are measured by his greatness whose body the Church is (vers. 15-18). (On "body," see note, ver. 18 .) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:24-29 Both the sufferings of the Head and of the members are called the sufferings of Christ, and make up, as it were, one body of sufferings. But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.</body></html>
