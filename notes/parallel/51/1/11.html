(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>, "According to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His spirit in the inner man.") On this use of "the glory" of God, frequent in these Epistles, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>, and Notes there. The prayer, however, in the Ephesian Epistle looks to "knowledge of the love of Christ" as its object; the prayer here to power of endurance of trial and suffering.<p><span class= "bld">Patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.--</span>(1) "Patience" is here "endurance," rather than what we usually call patience. It is spoken of by St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm" title="Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.">James 1:3</a>) as the result of the bracing effect of trial, and is illustrated by the typical example of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm" title="Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.">James 5:11</a>). Now a glance at the Book of Job will show that, while in respect of physical trial he is resignation itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm" title="And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm" title="But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.">Job 2:10</a>), yet that under the spiritual trial, which is the great subject of the book, he is the reverse of what is commonly called patient. He endures and conquers, but it is not without vehement passion and spiritual struggles, occasionally verging on a repining and rebellion, of which he bitterly repents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-6.htm" title="Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?">Job 41:6</a>). (2) To this "patience," therefore, here as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2Timothy 3:10</a>), St. Paul adds "longsuffering"--a word generally connected (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1Corinthians 13:4</a>) with the temper of gentleness and love, and coming much nearer to the description of our ordinary idea of a "patient" temper, which, in its calm sweetness and gentleness, hardly feels to the utmost such spiritual trials as vexed the righteous soul of Job. Of such longsuffering our Lord's bearing of the insults of the Condemnation and the cruelties of the Passion, when "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter," is the perfect type. (3) Yet even then St. Paul is not content without "joyfulness," in obedience to the command of our Master (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm" title="Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.">Matthew 5:12</a>), fulfilled in Himself on the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>). The ground of such joy, so often shown in Christian martyrdom, is given by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1Peter 4:13</a>), "Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy." Of that joy St. Paul himself was a bright example in his present captivity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-18.htm" title="What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.">Philippians 1:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Philippians 2:17-18</a>.) The words therefore form a climax. "Patience" struggles and endures; "long-suffering" endures without a struggle; "joyfulness" endures and glories in suffering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In all power being empowered, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and long suffering with joyfulness</span> (vers. 24, 29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1, 3, 9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>).

"Might" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">, in</span> distinction from power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) and other synonyms (comp. ver. 29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>), implies "mastery," "sovereign sway," and, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a> ("might of death"), is used in the New Testament only of the power of God. "Glory," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>, bears a substantive meaning of its own, and is not a mere attributive of "might." It is the splendour of God's revelations of himself, in which his <span class="accented">might</span> is So conspicuous. Gazing on this <span class="accented">glory</span>, especially as seen in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>) and the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a>, R.V.), the Christian discerns the might of him from whom it streams forth, and understands how that might is engaged in his behalf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19, 20</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5, 6</a>); and this thought fills him with invincible courage and endurance. <span class="accented">Patience</span> is steadfastness and stout heartedness under ill fortune (not a mere resigned <span class="accented">patience</span>); <span class="accented">long suffering</span> is gentleness of temper and magnanimity under ill treatment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; and see Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, and Trench's 'Synonyms'). Christ, in his earthly life, was the supreme example of <span class="accented">patience</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:5</a>, R.V.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3, 4</a>), which is "wrought by tribulation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>): <span class="accented">long-suffering</span> finds its pattern in God's dealing with "the unthankful and evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15</a>). "With joyfulness" belongs to this clause (Theodoret, Calvin, Bengel, Alford, Lightfoot) rather than the next, and lends a more vivid force to the foregoing words, while comparatively needless if prefixed to those that follow (so, however, Chrysostom, Erasmus, Meyer, Ellicott - "with joy giving thanks," etc.). This paradox is genuinely Pauline, and arises from personal experience (comp. ver. 24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.</body></html>
