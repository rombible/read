It corresponds very closely with the remarkable passage opening the Epistle to the Hebrews. In the Epistles of the preceding group, to the Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans, chief and almost exclusive prominence is given to the universal mediation of Christ, as justifying and sanctifying all the souls of men. In these Epistles (this truth being accepted) we pass on to that which such universal mediation necessitates--the conception of Christ as the Head of all created being, and as the perfect manifestation of the Godhead. The former is the key-note of the Ephesian Epistle; the latter is dominant here, although the former remains as an undertone; as also in the great passage of the Epistle to the Philippians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6-11</a>), speaking of Him as "in the form of God," and having "the Name which is above every name." The especial reason for St. Paul's emphatic assertion of the great truth here we see in the next chapter. But it is clear that it comes naturally in the order of revelation, leading up to the full doctrine of, "the Word" in St. John. As the spiritual meaning of the Resurrection, the great subject of the first preaching, had to be sought in the Atonement, so the inquiry into the possibility of an universal Atonement led back to the Incarnation, and to Christ as pre-existent from "the beginning" in God.<p>(13, 14) We enter on this great passage, as is natural, and accordant with St. Paul's universal practice, through that living and practical truth of our redemption in Christ Jesus, which in the earlier Epistles he had taught as the one thing needful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.">1Corinthians 2:2</a>).<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Who hath delivered us from the power of</span> <span class= "bld">darkness.</span>--"Delivered" is "rescued," properly applied to dragging a person out of battle or the jaws of danger. "The power of darkness" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-53.htm" title="When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.">Luke 22:53</a>) is, of course, the power of evil, permitted (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-6.htm" title="And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.">Luke 4:6</a>) to exist, but in itself a usurped tyranny (as Chrysostom expresses it), not a true "kingdom. Salvation is, first of all, rescue from the guilt and bondage of sin, to which man has given occasion by his own choice, but which, once admitted, he cannot himself break. It is here described in its first origination from the love of the Father. "God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son."<p><span class= "bld">And hath translated us . . .</span>--The word "translated" is a word properly applied to the transplanting of races, and the settlement of them in a new home. Salvation, begun by rescue, is completed by the settlement of the rescued captives in the new kingdom of Christ. The two acts, indeed, are distinct, but inseparable. Thus baptism is at once "for the remission of sins" and an "entrance into the kingdom of God."<p><span class= "bld">His dear Son.</span>--The original is far more striking and beautiful. It is, "The Son of His love," corresponding to "the beloved" of the parallel passage in the Ephesian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>), but perhaps going beyond it. God is love; the Son of God is, therefore, the "Son of His love," partaking of and manifesting this His essential attribute.<p><span class= "bld">In whom we have . . .</span>--This verse corresponds verbally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>, where see Note. From the love of the Father, the first cause of salvation, we pass to the efficient cause in the redemption and propitiation of the Son.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-17</a> pass from Christ as our Mediator to Christ as He is in Himself from all eternity, "the image of the invisible God," and as He is from the beginning of time, the creator and sustainer of all things in heaven and earth. What was before implied is now explicitly asserted; what was before emphatic ally asserted is now taken for granted, and made the stepping-stone to yet higher and more mysterious truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who</span> (<span class="accented">sc. the Father</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>rescued us from the dominion of the darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14-8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56, 57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7-11</a>).

Here we touch the central and governing idea of this Epistle, that of <span class="accented">the supreme lordship of Christ</span> (vers. 15-20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 10, 19</a>, etc.); and this passage affords a clue which will, we trust, guide us through some of the greatest difficulties which follow.

The "Son of his love" is not simply the "beloved Son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.), but the representative and depositary of his love: "Who is his love made manifest" (Augustine, Lightfoot; see ver. 2, note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-26.htm">John 17:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8, 9, 14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>), being at once our "Redeemer King "(ver. 13, 14) and the" Image of the invisible God" (ver. 15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.</body></html>
