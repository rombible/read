(<span class="accented">The gospel</span>) which you heard (vers. 5, 7: notes), which was preached in all creation that is under the heaven (ver. 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>). The transition from "you" to "all creation" resembles that of vers. 5, 6 (comp. vers. 20, 21). "Preached" is literally" heralded," "loudly and officially announced;" so, frequently in St. Paul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>), also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. Greek usage does not support the interpretation which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("creation ") equivalent to "humanity." This sense of the word, which, even in Mark, such interpreters as Bengel, Lange, Alford, reject, is quite Hebraistic and exceptional. The phrase, "all creation," the writer has already used in ver. 15; here, as there (see here), without the article (Revised Text). The universal meaning it carries there is now limited by "under the heaven." The <span class="accented">earthly creation</span> subject as it is to Christ, is the sphere of this proclamation, the <span class="accented">preaching room</span> which is to resound everywhere with the glad tidings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>). And with this range it <span class="accented">was proclaimed</span>, for from the first it claimed universal audience. Whereof I became, I Paul, a minister (vers. 24-29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1, 2, 16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16-18</a>). (For "minister," see ver. 7.) The later Epistles betray a markedly heightened sense in the apostle of the unique dignity and importance of his own position, and those who question their authenticity press this fact against them. But the difference of tone is what one would expect in "such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>). As the Gentile Churches grew, reverence for his person deepened; and the success of his life mission became more assured, especially now that the struggle with reactionary Judaism, signalized by the Epistles of the third missionary journey, was to a large extent decided in his favour. The false teachers he is now opposing did not, we should gather, attack the apostle personally; but may rather have claimed to be on his side. The movement of thought we have followed in vers. 15-23 proceeds from <span class="accented">Christ's redeeming work</span> to <span class="accented">the experience of the Colossians</span> in receiving it, and <span class="accented">the labours of the apostle</span> in publishing it; and is parallel to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-3:13</a>. Here, however, the <span class="accented">second</span> of these topics has been made quite subordinate (vers. 21-23: comp. Ephesians it.). The <span class="accented">third</span> is the subject of our next section. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisible God, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.</body></html>
