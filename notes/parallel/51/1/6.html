The probable reading is, <span class= "ital">which is come unto you, just as in all the world it is now bringing forth fruit and growing, as also it does in you.</span> In this sentence there are two lessons implied. First, the universality of the gospel, in which it stands contrasted, as with all local and national religions, whether of Judaism or of Paganism, so also with the secret doctrines of Gnostic speculation, intelligible only to the initiated few. Next, the test of its reality both by practical fruit of action, and by the spiritual growth connected therewith. In relation to the former, "faith without works" is "dead"; in relation to the other it is "imperfect," needing to be developed into maturity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-20.htm" title="But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?">James 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-22.htm" title="See you how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?">James 2:22</a>). Both these lessons were evidently needed, in consequence of the appearance at Colossae of the occult mysticism and the unpractical speculation noted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. But the Church itself was still faithful. Hence the last words, "as also it does in you," turning back again to Colossae in particular, are an insertion of kindly courtesy--one of the insertions of apparent afterthought not unfrequent in St. Paul's Epistles--intended to show that the implied warning is by no means a condemnation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That is come unto you, even as also</span> (it is) <span class="cmt_word">in all the world, bearing fruit and increasing, as in you also</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>; Acts if. 47; 5:14; 6:7; 9:31; 11:21; 12:24; 19:20). The words, "and increasing," are added to the text on the testimony, all but unanimous, of the older witnesses. Their propriety is manifest; for the success of the gospel at Colossae was a gratifying evidence, both of its inherent fruitfulness, and of its rapid progress in the Gentile world. Stationary at Rome (see Introduction, &sect; 3), and with his messengers coming and going, and news reaching him from time to time of the advance of the Christian cause, the strong expression, "in all the world," is natural to St. Paul. From Rome "all the world" is surveyed, just as what takes place at Rome seems to resound "in all the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). <span class="accented">Bearing fruit</span> (verb in middle voice, implying inherent energy) precedes <span class="accented">growing - the</span> first "describing the inner working," the second" the outward extension of the gospel" (Lightfoot). For "bearing fruit," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8, 16</a>: and for "growing," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-33</a>; and parallel passages; see also ver. 11. In the last clause the expression "doubles back upon itself" in a fashion characteristic of St. Paul, whose sentences grow and change their form like living things while he indites them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>, R.V.): the coming of the gospel to Colossae suggests the thought of its advent in the world, and this gives place to the fuller idea of its fruitfulness and expansion, which in turn is evidenced by its effect at Colossae. <span class="cmt_word">Since the day that ye heard (it), and knew well the grace of God in truth</span> (ver. 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1, 2, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14</a>). For their progress had been continuous (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>). Meyer and Ellicott, with the A.V., better maintain the connection of thought in understanding "the gospel" as object of "heard." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">knew well</span>, with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 9, etc.), belongs specially to the vocabulary of this group of Epistles. <span class="accented">Knowledge</span>, in 1 Corinthians, is denoted by the simple <span class="accented">gnosis.</span> But this word became at an early time the watchword of the heretical <span class="accented">Gnostics</span> (" men of knowledge:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>); and the false teachers of Colossae pretended to an intellectual superiority, asserted, we may imagine, in much the same way (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-4, 8, 23</a>). The apostle now prefers the more precise and distinctive <span class="accented">epignosis</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>), meaning" accurate" or" advanced knowledge" (see Lightfoot here, and on ver. 9). "To hear the gospel" is "to know well the grace of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20 - 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>); the <span class="accented">full knowledge</span> of which "in truth" (ver. 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14, 15, 20-24</a>) would preserve the Colossians from knowledge falsely so called. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.</body></html>
