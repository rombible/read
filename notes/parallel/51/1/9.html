The prayer is for their full and perfect knowledge of God's will; but this is emphatically connected with practical "walking" in that will, first by fruitfulness in good work, next by showing themselves strong in Christ to endure sufferings, lastly by thankful acceptance of God's call to inheritance among the saints in light. There is a hearty recognition of the blessing of knowledge (on which the incipient Gnosticism of the day was so eloquent); but it is to be tried by the three tests of practical goodness, patience, and thankful humility.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Do not cease to pray for you.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm" title="Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;">Ephesians 1:16</a>. "To pray" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Philippians 4:6</a>) is the general word for "to worship"; "to desire" indicates prayer, properly so called, asking from God what is requisite and necessary for ourselves or for others.<p><span class= "bld">The knowledge of his will.</span>--The "knowledge" here spoken of is the "full knowledge," to be attained in measure here, to be made perfect in heaven. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>, "Now I know in part; but then shall I know (perfectly) even as I am known." On this word, especially frequent in the Epistles of the captivity, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>. It should be noted that the knowledge here prayed for is "the knowledge <span class= "ital">of God's will"</span>--not speculation as to the nature of God, or as to emanations from Deity, or even as to the reasons of God's mysterious counsels, but knowledge of what actually is His will, both in the dispensation which is to be accepted in faith, and in the commandments to be obeyed in love. So St. Paul (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1Timothy 1:4-5</a>) contrasts with the "fables and endless genealogies" of Gnostic speculation, "the end of the commandment," "charity out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned."<p><span class= "bld">In all wisdom and spiritual understanding.</span>--This "knowledge of God's will" is man's "wisdom." For "wisdom" is the knowledge of the true end of life; which is (as the Book of Ecclesiastes so tragically shows) vainly sought, if contemplated apart from God's will, but found (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm" title="Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>) in the "fear of the Lord" and the "keeping of His commandments." (On the relation of the supreme gift of wisdom to lesser cognate gifts, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a>.) "Understanding" here is properly the faculty of spiritual insight or judgment, the speculative exercise of wisdom, as the "prudence" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a> is the practical. Hence St. Paul subjoins the practical element at once in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause we also</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6-13</a>).

For the errors invading Colossae were of a Gnostic type, mystic at once and rationalistic; against which a clear and well-informed understanding was the best protection (comp. notes on "truth," in vers. 5, 6; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8, 18, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>). This "wisdom and understanding" are "spiritual," as inspired by the Divine Spirit (comp. the use of "spirit," "spiritual," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a> and Gal 5:16, 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>), and opposed to all "wisdom of the flesh," the unrenewed nature of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4-6, 13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.</body></html>
