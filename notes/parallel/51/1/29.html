We need not, with Meyer and Ellicott, distinguish inward from outward <span class="accented">striving</span> in this word. The apostle's bodily sufferings (ver. 21) and his mental anxiety (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>) alike enter into the mighty struggle which he is maintaining on the Church's behalf, and which strains every fibre of his nature to the utmost (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>). "Striving" implies opponents against whom he contends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>); "toiling hard," the painful efforts he has to make. In this toll he is divinely sustained, for he "strives according to his [Christ's: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>] working." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("energy," "operative force," "power in action") - another word of St. Paul's vocabulary (frequent also in Aristotle) - is used by him only of supernatural power, "a working of God," "of Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which worketh in me with power</span> (ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>). The "energy of Christ" is such that it "effectually works" in the apostle; the same idea is repeated in noun and verb (ver. 11, note). The verb is middle in voice, as this "working" is that in which the Divine "energy of Christ" puts itself forth and shows what it can do (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3-6</a>); see note on "bearing fruit," ver. 6, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 318 (dynamic middle). So it works unmistakably "in [or, 'with'] power." Never do we find this consciousness of the Divine power dwelling in himself expressed by St. Paul with such joyous confidence as at this period (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9, 20</a>; and comp. note on ver. 23 b). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:24-29 Both the sufferings of the Head and of the members are called the sufferings of Christ, and make up, as it were, one body of sufferings. But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.</body></html>
