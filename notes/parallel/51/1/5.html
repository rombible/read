Compare the fuller expression of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1Thessalonians 1:3</a>, "your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope." But the place assigned to hope in this passage is notable. "For the hope" is really "on account of the hope." Hence faith and love are spoken of, not merely as leading up to hope, but as being actually kindled by it. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a> we find that, while faith and love are taken for granted, there is a special prayer that they may be enlightened "to know the hope of His calling" as the one thing yet needful. The prominence given to the thought of "the heavenly places" in the Epistles of the captivity, and therefore to Christ in heaven, even more than to Christ risen, is evident to any careful student. Accordingly, the hope, which is the instinct of perfection in man, and which becomes realisation of heaven in the Christian, naturally comes out with corresponding emphasis.<p><span class= "bld">Ye heard before.</span>--That is, at their first conversion. There is an implied warning against the new doctrines, which are more fully noticed in the next chapter.<p><span class= "bld">The truth of the gospel.</span>--This expression (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>) is emphatic. It refers to the gospel, not chiefly as a message of graciousness and mercy, but rather as a revelation of eternal truths, itself changeless as the truth it reveals. There is a corresponding emphasis, but stronger still, in St. John. (See, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1John 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.">1John 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2John 1:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-2.htm" title="Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.">3John 1:2-3</a>.) The gospel was now winning its way to supremacy over civilised thought. Hence the need of warning against the sudden growth of wild speculations, contrasted with the unchanging simplicity of its main truths.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - (We give thanks) <span class="cmt_word">because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm">Ephesians 1:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50-58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2, 3</a>). "Hope" is <span class="accented">objective - matter of hope</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-5.htm">Galatians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>. St. Paul speaks most of <span class="accented">heaven</span> and <span class="accented">heavenly things</span> in the letters of this period. Ver. 4 gives the nearest grammatical connection for this clause; and many recent commentators, following Greek interpreters, accordingly find here that which "evokes and conditions" the Colossians' "love" (Meyer, Ellicott) or "faith and love" (De Wette, Lightfoot). But this construction we reject. For it makes the heavenly reward the reason of the Colossians' present (faith and) love, reversing the true and Pauline order of thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17, 18</a>); while, on the other hand, the heavenly hope is the last and highest ground of the apostle's thanksgivings and encouragements, and the forfeiture or impairing of it the chief matter of his fears and warnings throughout the Epistles of this group (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 22, 23, 27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11-21</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>). It is better, therefore, with Bengel, Hofmann, Klopper, Conybeare, Eadie, and others, from Athanasius downwards, to refer ver. 5 as well as ver. 4 to the principal verb, "we give thanks" (ver. 3). What the apostle hears of "the faith and love" of the Colossian brethren moves him to give thanks for "the hope which is in store for them in heaven." Of that hope this faith and love are to him a pledge and an earnest, even as the "seal of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>) and the "peace of Christ in their hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; see note) are to themselves. Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4, 5</a>, from the present faith and patience of the saints the certainty of their future blessedness is argued. By singling out this <span class="accented">hope</span> as chief matter of thanksgiving here, the apostle enhances its certainty and its value in his readers' eyes. (On this verse, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 74-80.) From the <span class="accented">general occasion and ground</span> of his thanksgiving in the Christian state and prospects of his readers, St. Paul proceeds to dwell on certain <span class="accented">special circumstances</span> which enhanced his gratitude to God (vers. 56-8). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (hope) <span class="cmt_word">ye heard of before, in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span> or, <span class="accented">good tidings</span> (vers. 7, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). There is a veiled polemic reference in "the word of <span class="accented">the truth</span> of the gospel" (comp. ver. 7 and parallels from Galatians). The word "before" (<span class="accented">aforetime</span>) "contrasts their earlier with their later lessons, the true gospel of Epaphras with the false gospel of recent teachers" (Lightfoot). Others interpret, less suitably: <span class="accented">heard already</span> (<span class="accented">before my writing</span>), or <span class="accented">heard beforehand</span> (<span class="accented">before the fulfilment of the hope</span>). It is in St. Paul's manner to refer his readers at the outset to their conversion and first Christian experiences (see parallel passages). Their <span class="accented">hope</span> was directly at stake in the controversy with Colossian error. Here we meet the first of those cumulative combinations of nouns, so marked a feature of the style of Colossians and Ephesians, which are made a reproach against these Epistles by some critics; but each is appropriate in its place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.</body></html>
