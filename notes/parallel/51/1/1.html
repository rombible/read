The mention of Timotheus here, and the omission of his name there, mark the difference in character between the two Epistles. In a special Epistle like this Timotheus would be joined with St. Paul as usual. In a general Epistle to the churches of Asia, the Apostle alone could rightly speak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus through God's will, and Timothy the brother</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>). The apostle designates himself by his <span class="accented">office</span>, as always, except in the Macedonian Epistles and the letter of private friendship to Philemon. Timothy shares also in the greeting of the Epistle to Philemon, probably a leading member of the Colossian Church (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-9.htm">Colossians 4:9, 17</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2, 10-12</a>). During St. Paul's long residence at Ephesus Timothy was with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>), and there, probably, Philemon had come under his influence (see Introduction, &sect; 2), and made Timothy's acquaintance. There was, therefore, at least one link of acquaintance between "Timothy the brother" and "the saints in Colossae" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; 1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>, where his name appears in the same way). The honourable prominence thus given to Timothy marked him out for future leadership in the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2, 5, 6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.</body></html>
