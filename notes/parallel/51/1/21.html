The combination of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("being") with perfect passive participle ("having been alienated") implies a fixed condition, that has become as a part of one's nature (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, Revised Text). As the opposite of "reconciled," "alienated" is strictly passive, and denotes, not a subjective feeling on the part of the sinner, but an objective determination on the part of God, an exclusion from the Divine favour, from "the kingdom of the Son" and "the lot of the saints" (vers. 12, 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3, 11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>: comp. usage of LXX in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9; 1</a> Esdr. 9:4; Sir. 11:34). "Enemies in your thought" sets forth the disposition of the sinner towards God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18</a>: so Alford,Ellicott, Lightfoot). Meyer maintains the passive sense of "enemies," as found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>. On the latter view, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> is instrumental dative, "by," "in virtue of your state of mind;" on the former, it is dative of reference or definition. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (here only and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a> and Ephesians 4:18 in St. Paul) has possibly a polemical reference. It denotes in Greek philosophy, the faculty of <span class="accented">thought</span>, as opposed to the bodily powers. In Philo's teaching it signifies the higher part of human nature, akin to God, and opposed to evil which belongs to the senses: "Thought (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the best thing in us" ('On Fugitives,' &sect; 26); "Every man in regard to his intellect (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is united to the Divine Word, being an impression or fragment or ray of that blessed nature; but in respect of his body he belongs to the entire world" ('On the Creation of the World,' &sect; 51). But here sin is associated With <span class="accented">the intellect in</span> man, and redemption with "the body of Christ's flesh" (ver. 22): comp. notes on "reason," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>, and "body," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, where <span class="accented">the reason</span> is vain, <span class="accented">the intellect</span> darkened. "Wicked [emphasized by its position in the Greek, denoting <span class="accented">active</span> evil; see Trench's 'Synonyms,' on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>] works" is a phrase common in St. John, only used here by St. Paul (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). These <span class="accented">works</span> are the practices of life in which the sinner is abidingly excluded from "the kingdom of Christ and God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>), and manifests the radical antipathy of his mind toward God. "Yet [or, 'but'] now:" comp. ver. 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, etc. - a lively form of transition characteristic of St. Paul, primarily temporal, then also logical in sense. "Were ye reconciled" breaks through the grammatical structure of the sentence, as in vers. 26, 27 (see Lightfoot, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 717). If "did he reconcile" (or, "hath he reconciled") be the correct reading, "Christ" is still subject of the verb, as in vers. 19-22, and consistently with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>. (On "reconcile," see ver. 20.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisible God, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.</body></html>
