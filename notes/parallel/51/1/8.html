The love here would seem to be especially love towards St. Paul, a part of the "love towards all the saints" ascribed to them above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who also showed us your love in (the) Spirit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> your <span class="accented">love</span> to us. <span class="accented">Timothy and myself</span>, especially if we read "in our behalf" in ver. 7: so, many interprefers, from Chrysostom to Klopper. Epaphras had conveyed the blessings of the gospel from St. Paul to the Colossians, and they now send back the grateful assurance of their love by the same channel (comp, note on "having heard," ver. 4, and parallel passages). This was a choice fruit of the gospel in them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10, 15-18</a>), and such a reference to it gives a kindly conclusion to the thanksgiving. Ellicott and others understand here <span class="accented">brotherly love in general</span> - a somewhat pointless repetition of ver. 4. Meyer, reading "on your behalf" in ver. 7. more suitably suggests the Colossians' <span class="accented">love to Epaphras</span> in return for his services to them. The <span class="accented">Spirit</span> is the ruling element of the Colossians' love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) Love-in-the-Sprat forms a single compound phrase, like "faith-in-Christ-Jesus" (ver. 4). The one <span class="accented">Spirit</span> dwells alike in all the members of Christ's body, however sundered by place or circumstance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-4</a>), and makes them one in love to each other as to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23, 24</a>). "Spirit" occurs besides in this Epistle only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a> (but see "spiritual," ver. 9), and some find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1, 5</a> the explanation of this phrase (<span class="accented">sc.</span> "a love formed in absence, without personal intercourse:" but this is forced, and doubtful in point of grammar). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - The <span class="accented">opening prayer</span> rises out of the foregoing thanksgiving, and leads up to the chief doctrinal statement of the Epistle (vers. 15-20: compare, for the connection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8-17</a>). The burden of this prayer, as in other letters of this period, is the Church's need of <span class="accented">knowledge</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9, 10</a>). Here this desire has its fullest expression, as the necessity of the Colossians in this. respect was the more urgent and their situation, therefore, the more fully representative of the stage in the history of the Pauline Churches now commencing. He asks for his readers <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a fuller knowledge of the Divine will (ver. 9); to result in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> greater pleasingness to God (ver. 10 a), due <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to increased moral fruitfulness and spiritual growth (ver. 10 b), to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> patience under suffering (ver. 11), and to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> thankfulness for the blessings of redemption (vers. 12-14). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.</body></html>
