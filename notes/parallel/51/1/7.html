The name is a shortened form of Epaphroditus, but it is most unlikely that he is the same as the Epaphroditus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Philippians 4:18</a>. Being, it seems, a native of Colossae itself, he was apparently its first evangelist, and is afterwards described as feeling some responsibility for it and its neighbouring cities, Laodicea and Hierapolis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm" title=" For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.">Colossians 4:13</a>). His work could not have been transient, for under him the Colossians are said not only to have "heard," but also to have "known" (come to know perfectly) "the grace of God." St. Paul here gives emphatic testimony to his faithfulness, and to his preaching to them "in truth." That he was, then or afterwards. Bishop of Colossae is probably a mere guess of tradition. But he may have had some such charge as that which was afterwards more formally committed to Timothy at Ephesus, and Titus in Crete. At this time, however, he remained with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12-13</a>), and apparently shared his captivity, for he is called (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23</a>) his "fellow-prisoner."<p><span class= "bld">Who is for you a faithful minister</span> <span class= "bld">of Christ.</span>--(1) "For you" is, properly, <span class= "ital">on your behalf.</span> This has been supposed to mean that Epaphras, like his Philippian namesake, had been a representative of the Colossian Church, in ministry to the Apostle; but this is hardly compatible with the entire absence of any personal reference in the sentence. Contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm" title="Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:">Philemon 1:13</a>, "that on thy behalf he might minister <span class= "ital">to me."</span> If this reading, therefore, is to stand, "on your behalf" must be taken to signify generally "for your benefit," which is doubtless the meaning of our version. (2) But there is considerable, perhaps preponderating, MS. authority for the reading "on our behalf," that is, <span class= "ital">in our stead.</span> This makes Epaphras a representative, perhaps an actual messenger, of St. Paul, for the conversion of the church at Colossae; sent probably at the time when the Apostle had his head-quarters at Ephesus, and when "all that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-10.htm" title="And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.">Acts 19:10</a>). This interpretation not only gives greater force to this passage, but explains also the attitude of authority here assumed by St. Paul toward a church which he had not seen, differing so markedly from the tone of his Epistle to the Romans in a like case.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As ye learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant;</span> literally, <span class="accented">bondman</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-20.htm">Ephesians 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14</a>). Only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> does the epithet "fellow-bondman" appear again in St. Paul (the Revisers in these two places omit their marginal "bondservant"). The dominant thought of Christ Jesus "the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-4:1</a>) possibly dictates this expression. That the Colossians had received the gospel in this way from Epaphras, a disciple of St. Paul, was a striking proof of its fruitfulness, and a further cause for thanksgiving on his own part. <span class="cmt_word">Who is a faithful minister of Christ on our (or, <span class="accented">your</span>) behalf</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-22.htm">2 Corinthians 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). He puts his seal upon the ministry of Epaphras, and vindicates it against all questioning at home. Textual evidence for "on our" or "your behalf" is pretty evenly balanced: most older Greek copies read the first person, while the ancient versions generally adopted the second; and the critical editors are similarly divided. The Revisers, with Tregelles, Alford, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, prefer "our," which gives a finer and more fitting sense. It was as St. Paul's representative that Epaphras had ministered in Colossae, and to him he now reported his success; and this justified the apostle in claiming the Colossians as his own charge, and in writing to them in the terms of this letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1, 2, 5-7</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13-16</a>). "Minister" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">deacon</span>, in its official sense found in St. Paul first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, then in 1 Timothy) is to be distinguished from the "servant" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">slave</span>) of the last clause, and from "assistant" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>), and "attendant" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>); see Trench's 'Synonyms of the New Testament.' It is a favourite word of St. Paul's, and points to the service rendered, while other terms indicate the status of the servant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.</body></html>
