The "lot" (like the Old Testament type of the share in the land of Canaan," the lot of their inheritance") is the place assigned to the saints primarily by the grace of God. It may have, as in the case of the type, to be fought for; but it is won not by our own arm, but by "God's hand and His arm, and the light of His countenance, because He has a favour unto us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm" title="For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you had a favor to them.">Psalm 44:3</a>). Hence, in accordance with St. Paul's usual teaching (especially emphatic in this and the Ephesian Epistle), the whole stress is laid on God's grace, giving us our lot, and "making us meet" to accept it.<p><span class= "bld">In light.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">in the light.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8-14</a>--a passage dwelling on the idea of the kingdom of light, almost as strongly and exhaustively as St. John himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1John 1:5-7</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> "In the light" (opposed to "the power of darkness" of the next verse) is in the light of God's countenance, revealed in the face of Jesus Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Giving thanks to the Father, who made us</span> (or, <span class="accented">you</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>meet for our</span> (or, <span class="accented">your</span>) <span class="cmt_word">share in the lot</span> (or, <span class="accented">portion</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the saints in the light</span> (vers. 3-5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>). The reading "us" is very doubtful. Westcott and Hort, with Tischendorf, prefer "you," as in the two oldest manuscripts: for the transition from first to second person, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13, 14</a> (vers. 9-12). In the same strain the apostle gave thanks on their account (ver. 5). Thanksgiving" is prominent in this letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>), as "joy" in Philippians. The title "the Father" frequently stands alone in St. John's Gospel, coming from the lips of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Son</span>, but St. Paul employs it thus only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>, R.V.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>); see note on ver. 2. Those "give thanks to the Father" who gratefully acknowledge him in "the spirit of adoption" as their Father through Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>). And <span class="accented">the Father makes us meet for the inheritance</span> when he enables us to call him "Father" - "If children, then heirs." "To make meet" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, the verb found besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5, 6</a> in the New Testament, "to make sufficient," R.V.) is "to make competent," "to qualify" for sonic position or work. This <span class="accented">meetness</span>, already conferred on the Colossians, consists in their forgiveness (ver. 14) and adoption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5-7</a>), which qualify and entitle them to receive the blessings of Christ's kingdom (ver. 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>), and which anticipate and form the basis of that worthiness of character and fitness of condition in which they are finally to be presented "perfect in Christ" (vers. 10, 22, 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23, 24</a>); "not <span class="accented">qui dignos fecit</span> (Vulgate), but <span class="accented">qui idoneos fecit"</span> (Ellicott). "Called and (made us meet)" is one of the few characteristic readings of the great Vatican Manuscript, which Westcott and Herr reject (see their 'Introduction,' &sect; 320, and Lightfoot's 'Detached Notes,' p. 251). "The lot of the saints" is that entire wealth of blessedness laid up for the people of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-7</a>), in which each has his due <span class="accented">share</span> or <span class="accented">part</span> (Meyer, Ellicott, Lightfoot, less suitably: "parcel of (consisting in) the lot"); comp. ver. 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7</a>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("lot," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>), scarcely distinguishable from the more usual <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("inheritance," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>), is used in the Old Testament (LXX) of the sacred land as "divided by lot," and as "the lot" assigned to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-21.htm">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>, etc.), also of Jehovah himself as "the lot" of the landless Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>), and of Israel in turn as "the lot" of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>). It is the divinely allocated possession of the people of God in his kingdom. It belongs to them as "saints" (ver. 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15.htm">Psalm 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-34.htm">Numbers 35:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>); and it lies "in the light," in "the kingdom of the Son of God's love" (ver. 13) that is filled with the light of the knowledge of God proceeding from Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), light here manifest "in part" and in conflict with Satanic darkness (ver. 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:4-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>), hereafter the full possession of God's saints (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19, 20</a>). Vers. 13 and 14 proceed to show how this qualification has been gained. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.</body></html>
