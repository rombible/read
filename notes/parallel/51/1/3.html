They had been full of faith, love, and hope, the fruit of a true gospel preached by Epaphras; there was fear now lest they should be beguiled from it, although that fear was obviously not yet realised, as had been formerly the case with the Galatians. Hence St. Paul's emphasis on their hearing, knowing, and learning the truth, and on the faithfulness of Epaphras as a minister of Christ.<p>(3, 4) Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15-16</a>, where there is an almost exact verbal coincidence. Whatever may be the force there of the words "having <span class= "ital">heard</span> of your faith," clearly here they harmonise with many indications that the Colossian Church, though well known to St. Paul, was not known by personal knowledge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-8.</span> - The <span class="accented">opening thanksgiving</span> is full and appropriate. Its content is determined by the state of this Church, and by the apostle's relation to it through Epaphras, and his own present position. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We give thanks to God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="accented">We</span>; <span class="accented">Timothy and I</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>, etc.). The Revised Text omits "and" between" God" and "Father," following Lachmann, Westcott and Heft, and Lightfoot (who hesitates), on evidence numerically slight, but sufficient; especially as in every other instance of this combination the conjunction is present. "Father" is also without definite article in the better attested (Revised) reading. The words, "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," bear, therefore, an explanatory, quasi-predicative force. St. Paul wishes his readers to understand that he gives thanks to God on their account distinctly under this aspect, regarded as <span class="accented">"Father</span> of Christ." He has just spoken <span class="accented">of "our</span> Father," and now adds, "Father of our Lord Jesus <span class="accented">Christ,"</span> suggesting that it is in this relation that we know God as <span class="accented">"our</span> Father," the Author of grace and peace, the Object of Christian thanksgiving. So the sovereign and exclusive mediation of Christ, the ruling idea of the whole Epistle, is thrown into bold relief at the outset; and, in this light, the unique omissions of vers. 2 and 3 explain and justify each other. This fatherhood embraces the entire Person and offices of the Son as "our Lord Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Praying always for you</span> (ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>). The apostle had known from the first of the existence of this Church; and had already been in communication with it (see Introduction, &sect; 2). He had, therefore, a general prayerful interest in the Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>), that has been quickened to joyful thanksgiving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6-10</a>) by the arrival of Epaphras. "Always" and <span class="accented">"for</span> you" - either or both of the phrases - may be joined grammatically to <span class="accented">"we</span> give thanks" or to "praying:" the latter connection is preferable (see Alford or Ellicott); similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-4.htm">Philemon 1:4</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a> the turn of expression is different. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.</body></html>
