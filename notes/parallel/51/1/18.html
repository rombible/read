In this he touches on a doctrine more fully developed in the Epistle to the Ephesians. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>.) But still, as has been already noted, there is in this Epistle more stress on the supreme dignity of the Head, as in the other more on the unity, and blessing, and glory of the Body. It should be observed that in this, His mediatorial office, there is throughout a mysterious analogy to His eternal sonship. In both He is "the Head," first, of universal creation, next, of the new creation in His Church; He is "the beginning," in the one case in eternity, in the other in time; He is "the firstborn," now in Eternal Sonship, now in the Resurrection making Him the new life of mankind.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">He is the head.</span>--"He" is again emphatic. "He who is the image of God, He also is the Head." (On the title itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The beginning.</span>--Chrysostom reads here a kindred word, <span class= "ital">the first-fruits.</span> The reading is no doubt a gloss, but an instructive one. It shows that the reference is to Christ, as being in His humanity "the first principle" of the new life to us--the "first-fruits" from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1Corinthians 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1Corinthians 15:23</a>), and "the bringer of life and immortality to light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2Timothy 1:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The firstborn from the dead.</span>--The same title is given to Him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,">Revelation 1:5</a>. In his sermon at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>), St. Paul quotes the passage, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee," as fulfilled in that "He raised up Jesus again." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.">Hebrews 5:5</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>, he speaks of Christ as "declared" (or, <span class= "ital">defined</span>) "to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead." The Resurrection is (so to speak) His second birth, the beginning of that exaltation, which is contrasted with His first birth on earth in great humility, and of His entrance on the glory of His mediatorial kingdom. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>, where the starting-point of all His exaltation is again placed in the Resurrection.)<p><span class= "bld">That in all things he might . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">That in all things He might become pre-eminent.</span> The words "He might become," are opposed to the "He is" above. They refer to the exaltation of His humanity, so gloriously described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9-11</a>. Thus absolutely in His divine nature, relatively to the mediatorial kingdom in His humanity, He is "the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.">Revelation 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.">Revelation 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

The Pauline doctrine of the Church as the body of Christ is developed in Colossians and Ephesians, especially in the later Epistle, where it receives its fruitful application. Here the doctrine of the Person of Christ and the doctrine of the Church find their meeting-point as mutually implying each other, and together opposed to the double effect of early Gnosticism, which tended first to lower the dignity of Christ, and then to impair the unity of his Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, note). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4, 5</a> the figure of the <span class="accented">body and members</span> is merely a passing illustration of the mutual relation of believers in the Church; now <span class="accented">the body of Christ</span> becomes the formal title of the Church, expressing the fundamental and fixed conception of its nature as related to him, who is the centre of its unity, the source of all vital energy and directing control within it (comp. the <span class="accented">vine and branches</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15.htm">John 15</a>.). In vers. 16, 17 the writer passed from the thought of the origin to that of the constitution of the cosmos; now he proceeds in the reverse order. (<span class="accented">He is the head</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>who is</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Beginning</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is without article, used as a proper noun. It is arbitrary to identify it with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> ("firstfruits") of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16</a>. As explained by the following words, it denotes, as in philosophical Greek, a <span class="accented">first principle, originating cause, fens et origo</span> (see Lightfoot's note and references). To borrow "of the dead" from the following parallel clause weakens the force of both. His body, the Church, <span class="accented">begins</span> in him, dating and deriving from him its "all in all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This is quite consistent with the "all things are of God" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; for the apostle is thinking here of the relative, historical beginning of <span class="accented">"the</span> kingdom of the Son" (ver. 13), there of the absolute beginning of the Divine work of redemption (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; and note on "unto him," ver. 16). St. John, writing to the neighbouring Laodicea, echoes, apparently, this language of our apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>) <span class="cmt_word">As Firstborn out of the dead</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-30.htm">Acts 13:30-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>), this Beginning actually begins; Christ becomes the source, of a new humanity, a new creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). The apostle derives the whole life and power of Christianity, whether as seen in Christ or proved by his people, from his resurrection (see parallels). The name <span class="accented">Firstborn</span> brings over with it into this verse the glory which surrounds it in ver. 15. The Divine Firstborn, who is before and over all things, wins his title a second time for his earthly brethren's sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10-15</a>). As he appears "out of the dead," born anew from the dark womb of the grave, the nether abyss (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm">Romans 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>), the Father declares to him, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>); the Church exclaims," My Lord and my God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>); "all authority in heaven and on earth" becomes his (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>); he is made "Firstborn over many brethren," who call him Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>); and proceeds to "subdue all things unto himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).

And he won this title so as to carry out an antecedent purpose in his mind (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; "In the mind of the father," say Meyer and others - a thought true in itself, but interpolated here), viz. that he might become in all things pre-eminent (ver. 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm">Luke 19:12-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-29.htm">Luke 22:29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7, 8</a>).

He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.</body></html>
