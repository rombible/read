"We <span class="accented">have</span> redemption" ("<span class="accented">had</span> it," according to a few ancient witnesses) in present experience in "the forgiveness of our sins "(vers. 21, 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7-2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a> gives its objective ground. The "redemption of the body" (also <span class="accented">bought</span> by the same <span class="accented">price</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>) will make the work complete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). Lightfoot suggests that the apostle intends to contradict the doctrine of redemption taught by the Gnostics, who made it consist in initiation into their "mysteries" (see note on ver. 27); and supposes that this notion may already have existed at Colossae in some incipient form. But such an abuse of the term seems to imply a well established and familiar Christian use. Philo, who speaks the language of the Jewish philosophic mysticism of the first century, has no such usage. In firm, clear lines the apostle has retraced, in vers. 12-14 (comp. vers. 20-23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-14</a>), the teaching of his earlier Epistles on the doctrines of salvation. Here he assumes, in brief and comprehensive terms, what in writing to the Galatians and Romans he had formerly been at so much pains to prove. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.</body></html>
