(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm" title="Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.">1Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.">2Thessalonians 3:5</a>.) "Teaching" is simply instruction--including, of course, practical exhortation--of those already warned.<p><span class= "bld">Perfect.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Philippians 3:15</a>, and Notes there. Here, however, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6-7</a>, the reference may be to the sense of "perfect "as "initiated in mystery." St. Paul, in opposition to the exclusive claim of "perfection" by the speculators in mystic knowledge ("falsely so called") would present "every man," learned or ignorant, "perfect before God." In this universality of privilege lies the glorious distinction between the gospel and all schools of philosophy, whether they reject or assume its name.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom we proclaim, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-11.htm">1 Corinthians 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22, 23</a>). <span class="accented">We</span> (emphatic, like the "I" of vers. 23, 25) includes St. Paul's coadjutors, Epaphras in particular (ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7, 11, 12</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to publish</span>, bears a wider sense than <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to herald</span> (ver. 23), St. Paul's favourite word. "Admonishing and teaching" are the two essential parts of the apostle's ministry, related as repentance to faith (Lightfoot, who gives interesting classical parallels). <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> (radically, "to put in mind"), peculiar to St. Paul in New Testament (including <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>), may denote reproof for the past, but more especially warning for the future (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>: comp. note on Colossians 3:16). Thrice in this verse "every man" is repeated, and "in all wisdom" follows "teaching" with a marked emphasis. The Colossian errorists, as we should presume from the general tenor and affinities of their system, sought to form an inner mystical school or circle of discipleship within the Church, initiated into a wisdom and holiness supposed to be higher than that attainable by ordinary Christian faith (see note on "mystery," ver. 26; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3, 8</a>). <span class="accented">An intellectual caste-feeling</span> (see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>) was springing up in the Church. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a> the apostle denounces the pride of reason which claims "the things of God" as its own; here he denounces the pride of intellect which refuses the knowledge of them to those who stand on a lower level of mental culture. To <span class="accented">every man</span> the Divine wisdom in Christ is accessible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18, 19</a>): to none but "the spiritual man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 12-3:1</a>). "Wisdom" here is not subjective, a quality of the apostle (so Meyer, quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>), but objective, the quality of the truth itself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we may present every man perfect in Christ</span> (ver. 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-7.htm">2 Corinthians 13:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>): the aim alike of Christ's redemption (ver. 22) and of the apostle's ministry. "Perfect" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is a word associated with the Greek mysteries (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>; and quotations in Lightfoot), and in common use denoted "full-grown," "grown men," as opposed to" children "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:1</a>). The philosophic Judaists affected this term considerably. Philo frequently distinguishes between the "perfect" or "fully initiated" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), who are admitted to the sight of God, and the "advancing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>), who are candidates for admission to the Divine mysteries; and he makes Jacob a type of the latter, Israel of the former (see 'On Drunkenness,' &sect; 20; 'On Change of Names,' &sect; 3; 'On Agriculture,' &sect;&sect; 36-38). The apostle makes "perfect" designedly parallel to the "holy and without blemish" of ver. 22, holding out a spiritual ideal very different from that of Alexandrine mystics; and declares that it is to be realized "in Christ" (vers. 2, 4), as in ver. 22 it appeared to be wrought "through Christ" and "for Christ" (comp. ver. 16). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:24-29 Both the sufferings of the Head and of the members are called the sufferings of Christ, and make up, as it were, one body of sufferings. But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.</body></html>
