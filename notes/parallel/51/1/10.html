"The Lord" is here, as usual, the Lord Jesus Christ; to walk worthy of Him is to have His life reproduced in us, to follow His example, to have "the mind of Christ Jesus." The "worthiness" is, of course, relative to our capacity, not absolute.<p><span class= "bld">All pleasing.</span>--The word here used is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is employed in classic and Hellenistic Greek to mean "a general disposition to please"--a constant preference of the will of others before our own. It is here used with tacit reference to God, since towards Him alone can it be a safe guide of action. Otherwise it must have the bad sense which in general usage was attached to it. St. Paul emphatically disowns and condemns the temper of "men-pleasing" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm" title="Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1Thessalonians 2:4</a>), as incompatible with being "the servant of Christ." He could, indeed, "be all things to all men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1Corinthians 9:22</a>); he could bid each man "please his neighbour for his edification" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-12.htm" title="And again, Esaias said, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.">Romans 15:12</a>). But the only "pleasing" to which the whole life can be conformed is (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>) the consideration "how we ought to walk and to please God." Only in subordination to this can we safely act on the desire of "all pleasing" towards men.<p><span class= "bld">Increasing in </span>(<span class= "ital">or, by</span>) <span class= "bld">the knowledge of God.</span>--The context evidently shows that the path towards the knowledge of God here indicated is not the path of thoughtful speculation, or of meditative devotion, but the third path co-ordinate with these--the path of earnest practice, of which the watchword is, "Do and thou shalt know."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm">Hebrews 13:21</a>); so <span class="accented">as to please him in every way.</span> "The end of all knowledge, the apostle would say, is conduct" (Lightfoot). Spiritual enlightenment (ver. 9) enables the Christian to <span class="accented">walk</span> (a Hebraism adopted also into biblical English) in a way "worthy of the Lord" (Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>, etc.), becoming those who have such a Lord and who profess to be his servants. And to be "worthy of Christ" is to "please God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4, 5, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>). This is the ideal and the aim of the religious life throughout the Bible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8</a>). The characteristics of this walk are set forth by three coordinate participial phrases (vers. 10b-12), standing in the half independent nominative case instead of the more regular accusative (as agreeing with the understood object of the infinitive <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: see Winer's ' N.

"Good work" is that which is <span class="accented">beneficial, practically good</span> (see parallel passages). "In every good work" might grammatically qualify the foregoing" pleasing ' (so R.V. margin and many older interpreters), but appears to be parallel in position and sense with "in all power" (ver. 11). On"bearing fruit" (active in voice where the subject is <span class="accented">personal:</span> comp. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>), see note to ver. 6. While doing good to his fellow-men, the Christian is <span class="cmt_word">growing by</span> (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the knowledge of God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>). His own nature becomes larger, stronger, more complete. Here it is individual (internal) growth, in ver. 6 collective (external) growth (of the gospel, the Church) that is implied; the two are combined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13-16</a>. The dative <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (so best copies and Revised Text: the Received, <span class="accented">unto the knowledge</span>, is a repetition of ver. 9) is "dative of instrument" (Alford, Lightfoot) rather than "of respect" (<span class="accented">in the knowledge</span>; so R.V.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.</body></html>
