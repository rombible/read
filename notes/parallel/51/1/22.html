The meaning is, of course, His natural body, as distinguished from His mystic Body, spoken of above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>). But this is no sufficient reason for the use of this phrase, for there could be no confusion between them in this passage. Hence, without ascribing to the word "flesh" a distinctly polemical intention, we may not unnaturally suppose that there was present to St. Paul's mind the thought of the Gnosticism, which depreciated the body as evil, and which must have always inclined to the idea that "Jesus Christ had not come in the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1John 4:2-3</a>); and that the presence of this thought induced some special emphasis in his language.<p><span class= "bld">Holy and unblameable and unreproveable.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>. The word "to present" is used both in a sacrificial sense (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>) and in the sense of introduction and presentation (as of a bride, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The words, "holy and unblameable," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"without blemish," suit the former sense. But "unreproveable" is incongruous with it, and the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>) speaks of "access" or introduction to the Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the body of his flesh</span> (ver. 20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-10.htm">1 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). With a significant emphasis, the material body of Christ is made the instrument of that reconciliation in the carrying out of which "his whole fulness" is engaged (vers. 19, 20); see note on "thought," ver. 21, and on "body," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. The necessity of the double expression was shown by the fact that the Gnostic Marcion erased "of his flesh" from the text of this Epistle, and interpreted "the body" as "the Church;" Bengel and others suppose "of his flesh "to be added to prevent this mistake (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:19). This phrase was the crux of Docetism, whose principles were indeed implicitly contained in the Alexandrine-Jewish philosophy with its contempt for matter and the physical life, which was now first beginning to leaven the Church. <span class="accented">Body</span> is antithetical to <span class="accented">soul: flesh</span> to <span class="accented">spirit.</span> The former is individual and concrete, the actual physical organism; the latter denotes the material of which it consists, the bodily nature in its essence and characteristics (comp. note on ver. 11; and see Cremer's 'Lexicon' on these words). "In the body" is not "by the body," nor "during his earthly life" (as though opposed to "out of the body," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-3.htm">2 Corinthians 12:3</a>), but "as incarnate." The Epistle to the Hebrews expands the thought of our Epistle in its own way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>. That reconciliation is through the (or, <span class="accented">his</span>) death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm">John 11:51, 52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>) is the fundamental axiom of the gospel (ver. 5), already implied in vers. 14 and 20. And the atoning death presupposes the Incarnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>). The two foregoing phrases belong grammatically to ver. 21. To present you holy and without blemish and unreprovable before him (ver. 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>); before "Christ" (ver. 19), who is "Judge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22, 23</a>) as well as "King" and "Redeemer" (vers. 13, 14): this also belongs to his <span class="accented">fulness.</span> He will "himself present the Church to himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, Revised Text; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>). In this <span class="accented">presentation</span> his redeeming work culminates (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; and, in view of the connection of vers. 22 and 23, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-6.htm">1 Corinthians 1:6-9</a>). So, in general, Meyer and Alford. Ellicott and Lightfoot refer to <span class="accented">God's present approbations</span>, quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, a parallel much less close than ver. 27, and supposing "God" the subject of the verb (see note on ver. 19). "Holy erga Deum; <span class="accented">without blemish</span> respectu vestri; <span class="accented">unreprovable</span> respectu proximi" (Bengel). (On "holy," see note, ver. 2; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>.) "Apropos is not "without blame," but "without blemish," "immaculate" (Lightfoot, R.V.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). In the LXX it is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">tamim</span> ("integer"), "faultless" in bodily condition or in moral character. "Unreprovable," as a judicial term ("without charge that can be preferred"), points to the judgment day, and hence is wanting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-10.htm">1 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6, 7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisible God, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.</body></html>
