As the Church's <span class="accented">minister</span>, he is bound to toil and to suffer in whatever way her welfare requires. Elsewhere he styles himself "minister of the gospel" (ver 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>), "of God," "of Christ," "of a new covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>). (On "minister," see note, ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">According to the stewardship of God, that was given me to you-ward</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>, R.V.; 1 Timothy 3:15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-2.htm">Luke 16:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("economy") is first "house-management," then "administration" generally the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("house-steward") was a confidential upper servant, frequently a slave, who controlled the general arrangements of a large establishment, and was responsible immediately to the master. Such an office the apostle holds, along with others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>), in the Church, "the house of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a>: this conception, like that of "the body of Christ" - comp. note on ver. 18 - is fully developed only in the later Epistles). In this office he "administers the gospel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17, 18</a>), "the grace of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>), and here more especially "the mystery" of vers. 26, 27 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, R.V.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a> and Ephesians 3:2, the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is referred to God himself, the supreme Dispenser in his own house. This office "was given" him, and specifically as "toward the Gentiles" (for "you" points to the Colossians as Gentiles, vers. 24, 27, notes; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>), when he first became a servant of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15, 16</a>). Some interpreters connect "to you-ward" with the word "fulfil," but less suitably (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To fulfil the word of God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>). "To fulfil" (see vers. 9, 24, and "fulness," ver. 19; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>) is either "to complete," to give full development and extension to the gospel message (vers. 5, 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 21, 27</a>); or "to accomplish" the prophetic word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8 - 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15-17</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>, and frequently in the Gospels. This verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, however, is not used by St. Paul elsewhere in the latter sense, and the former precisely suits the context (compare parallels from Romans). Other interpretations - "to preach abundantly," "to continue Christ's preaching" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>), "to execute the Divine commission" - miss the sense of the verb. <span class="accented">The word</span> which it is the object of the apostle's ministry <span class="accented">to fulfil</span>, and in regard to which he had a special stewardship, is none other than - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:24-29 Both the sufferings of the Head and of the members are called the sufferings of Christ, and make up, as it were, one body of sufferings. But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.</body></html>
