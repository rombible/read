It was of God's own pleasure, inscrutable to man. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>, we read "the mystery of His will." Note also, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4-6</a>, the repeated reference to the predestination of God in His love.<p><span class= "bld">The riches of the glory.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>; and Notes there.<p><span class= "bld">Which is Christ in you.</span>--This mystery specially committed to St. Paul to declare is. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a>, defined thus, "That the Gentiles should be (or, <span class= "ital">are</span>) fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel"; and the nature of this promise is explained below, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." Here the mystery itself is boldly defined as "Christ in you;" just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, according to one interpretation of that difficult passage, "the mystery of godliness" is Christ Himself, "who was manifest," &c. Here we have again a significant illustration of the difference between the characteristic ideas of the two Epistles. In the Ephesian Epistle the unity of all in God's covenant is first put forth, and then explained as dependent on the indwelling of Christ in the heart. Here the "Christ in you" is all in all: the unity of all men in Him is an inference, but one which the readers of the Epistle are left to draw for themselves. On the great idea itself, in the purely individual relation, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; in the more general form, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?">2Corinthians 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The hope of (</span><span class= "ital">the</span>) <span class= "bld">glory.</span>--So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1Timothy 1:1</a>, "The Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope." "The glory" is the glorified state of perfection in heaven, wrapt in the communion with God, and so "changed from glory to glory." Again we note (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>) the special emphasis laid on the hope of heaven. Christ is "our hope," as He is "our life," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the ground of our sure and certain hope of the future, as of our spiritual life in the present.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the Gentiles</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11, 12, 25-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9-12</a>). "Willed" stands emphatically first in the Greek. The revelation was so momentous in its issue, so signal in its method, and so contrary to human foresight and prejudice, that it proceeded evidently from" the will of God" (vers. 1, 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18</a>): "Who was I," said St. Peter, "that I could withstand God?" The Ephesian letter delights to dwell on <span class="accented">God's will</span> as the cause of the whole counsel and work of salvation. The Revisers have rendered the verb by "was pleased," the equivalent of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> (ver. 19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 9</a>; etc.). There is no need to seek a reference to <span class="accented">free grace</span> in the verb "willed;" the two ideas are concurrent, but distinct (see, however, Lightfoot). The apostle's mind is filled with amazement as he contemplates the boundless <span class="accented">riches</span> which the salvation of the Gentiles revealed in God himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8-10</a>). "The glory of this mystery" is the splendour with which it invests the Divine character (on "glory," see note, ver. 11; and for "riches of glory," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>). <span class="accented">Amongst the Gentiles:</span> "semi-local clause, defining the sphere in which the riches of the glory is more specially evinced" (Ellicott). At last this <span class="accented">mystery</span> is defined: <span class="cmt_word">which is Christ in you</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>). By a bold metonymy, the <span class="accented">mystery</span> is identified with its subject or content. It is "Christ" himself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>, note), the Divine secret of the ages, the burden of all revelation; and "Christ in you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), Christ dwelling in Gentile carts - this is the wonder of wonders! So the "sinners of the Gentiles" receive "the like [equal] gift" with the heirs of the promises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>). By a further and yet bolder apposition, this mystery of <span class="accented">Christ in Colossian believers</span> is <span class="cmt_word">made one with the hope of glory</span> (vers. 5, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm">Ephesians 1:12-14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), of which it is a pledge and a foretaste (vers. 4, 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10-17</a>). This <span class="accented">glory</span> is that which the Christian will wear in his perfected, heavenly state (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>), when he will fully reflect the glory he now beholds in God through Christ ("the glory of this mystery"): compare the double "glory" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. The rights of the Gentile believer in Christ are therefore complete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). Possessing him now in his heart, he anticipates all that he will bestow in heaven (on "hope," see ver. 5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:24-29 Both the sufferings of the Head and of the members are called the sufferings of Christ, and make up, as it were, one body of sufferings. But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.</body></html>
