This is the first principle of all godly life. The main object of all life, speculative or practical, is declared to be, not our own happiness or perfection, not the good of our fellow-men, but the "glory of God"--the carrying out of His will, and so manifesting His moral attributes. We are taught that if we "seek this first, all the other things shall be added unto us." But here we have the principle, not only of godly life, but of Christian life. It does all "in the name of Christ," that is, as conformed to His image, and so being His representative; it looks up thankfully to God our Father, but it is through Him, "having our sonship by adoption" through His all-sufficient mediation. Its desire is, not only that God may be glorified, but that "He may be glorified through Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">1Peter 4:11</a>). Once more we trace here the special and emphatic purpose of the Epistle.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm" title=" Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.">Colossians 3:18</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a> deals with the three great relations of life--between wives and husbands, children and parents, servants and masters. In this section we have the closest parallelism with the Epistle to the Ephesians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:22</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>). But the treatment of the first relation is far briefer, having nothing to correspond to the grand and characteristic comparison of marriage to the union between Christ and the Church. Even in the second there is somewhat greater brevity and simplicity. The third is dwelt upon with marked coincidence of language, and at least equal emphasis. We can hardly doubt that the presence of Onesimus, the runaway slave, suggested this peculiar emphasis on the right relation between the slave and his master.<p>[It will only be necessary to note the few points in which this section differs notably from the parallel passage.]<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And everything, whatever ye he doing in word or deed,</span> (do) <span class="cmt_word">all in the name of</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Lord Jesus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>). Ver. 16 speaks of "word" only; to it is added the "deed," which stands for all the practical activities of life. Both meet in the following "all." "The name of the Lord Jesus" is the expression of his authority as "Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13, 15, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>), and of his personal character and relation to us as "Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, Revised Text). (On the prominence of the title "Lord" in this Epistle, see note on Colossians 2:6.) (For the emphatic, absolute nominative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> at the head of the sentence, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-10.htm">Luke 12:10</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Giving thanks to God</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Father through him</span> (ver. 15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>). Again <span class="accented">thanksgiving</span> is urged on the Colossians. It is to be the accompaniment of daily talk and work - to be offered to God in his character as "Father" (see notes on Colossians 1:2, 3, 12), and "through the Lord Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>), by whom we have access to the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>) and receive from him all the benefits of redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-17 We must not only do no hurt to any, but do what good we can to all. Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.</body></html>
