(Comp. the fuller treatment of this subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14-22</a>; where, in accordance with the whole character of that Epistle, the unity "in one Body," here only alluded to, is worked out in vividness and detail.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let the peace of Christ be umpire in your hearts</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14, 20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>). "Of God," the reading of the Received Text, is borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>, where, however, "in Christ Jesus" follows (comp. ver. 13 <span class="accented">b</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). "The peace of Christ" is that which he effects in reconciling men to God, and to himself as their Lord (ver. 13 <span class="accented">b</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, see note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>). Here is the source of inner tranquillity and health of soul (see note on "peace," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); and of the outward union and harmony of the Church, the body of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Christ's peace</span>, his "legacy," is that which he possessed and exemplified - an idea foreign to this context. This "peace" is to "act as umpire" in the Christian's heart. The compound <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>-<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> ("act as umpire against you") has already been used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a> (see note; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>, cognate <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of the false teacher who, in condemning the faith of the Colossian Christians as insufficient for the attaining of "perfectness" (ver. 14) without angel worship, etc., virtually <span class="accented">took away their prize</span> and judged them "unworthy of eternal life." The Greek commentators seem, therefore, to be right, as against most moderns (but see Klopper on the other side), in retaining the primary sense of the verb instead of generalizing it into "rule" or the like. It stands in precise antithesis, both of sense and sound, to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>: "Let not the deceivers decide against you, but let the peace of Christ decide in your hearts" (Cramer's 'Catena'). "The peace of Christ" dwelling within the heart is to be the security of the Colossian believer against the threats of false teachers: "They seek to rob you of your prize; let this assure you of it." Present, conscious peace with God is a warrant of the Christian's hope of everlasting life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>). This assurance is identical with "the witness of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). The apostle argued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 5</a> from the present faith and love of his readers to "the hope laid up for them in heaven;" here he bids them find in the peace which Christ has brought to their souls the earnest of their future bliss. It is but a generalizing of the same idea when he speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a> of "the peace of God" as "garrisoning the heart and thoughts" against fear and doubt. <span class="cmt_word">Unto which also ye were called, in one body</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-18, 1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>). So this "peace" is to be at once their inward safeguard, and the ground of their outward union. They are to stand together in its defence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>). Error, which blights the Church's <span class="accented">hope</span>, destroys her unity. So the maintenance of that "one hope of our calling," assured by a Divine peace within the soul, unites all Christian hearts in a common cause (compare the connection of vers. 18 and 19 in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>.). With St. Paul, the peace of God's children with him and with each other is so essentially one that he speaks almost indistinguishably of both (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He adds, and be ye thankful</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>); viz. "for this assurance of your future blessedness afforded by the peace of Christ within your hearts, with its outward evidence in your Christian unity." The apostle gave thanks for them on like grounds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5</a>: comp. 1:12-14). The command <span class="accented">to give thanks</span> prevails in this Epistle, as that <span class="accented">to rejoice</span> in Philippians. "Be" is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("become"); so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1, 17</a>. It implies "striving after an aim as not yet realized" (Meyer: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>) - rather, therefore, "to be in act," "to prove" or "show one's self thankful" (see Grimm's 'Lexicon;' and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-36.htm">Luke 10:36</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-17 We must not only do no hurt to any, but do what good we can to all. Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.</body></html>
