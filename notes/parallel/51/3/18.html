THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF FAMILY DUTIES. We note that in each of the three family relations here dealt with, the subordinate party is first addressed, and the duty of submission is primarily insisted upon (vers. 18, 20, 22: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3, 5-8</a>. There may have been some special reason for this in the state of the Asiatic Churches or of Greek society in that region. But other indications show (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-24.htm">1 Corinthians 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5, 9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>) that the apostle perceived and sought to check the danger of unsettlement in the natural order of family and social life which often attends great spiritual revolutions, especially when they are in the direction of religious liberty. As in the case of Luther, the apostle's later teaching is largely directed against the antinomianism which resulted, by way of perversion and abuse, from the preaching of salvation by grace and of the sanctity of the individual believer (comp. introductory note to this chapter). Observe how <span class="accented">the Lord</span> and his authority are made to furnish a higher sanction for each of these natural duties. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fit in the Lord</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). On this duty the apostle dilates in the Ephesian letter, in illustration of its teaching respecting "Christ and the Church" (comp. the very different treatment of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-7</a>), The use of the <span class="accented">article</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) in the nominative of address is frequent in New Testament, though not in classical Greek. Lightfoot thinks it Hebraistic. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> stands in the imperfect tense (literally, <span class="accented">it was</span> fit), denoting a normal propriety (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4</a>, Westcott and Hort; and for the general expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm">1 Corinthians 11:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-8.htm">Philemon 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>). Like all men of a sound moral nature, St Paul has a strong sense of natural propriety. The adjunct "in the Lord" belongs to "was fit," not "be subject" (comp. ver. 20). The constitution of nature, as we have learnt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>, is grounded "in the Lord." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a> St. Paul shows that this inherent propriety has a deep spiritual significance; and he makes the subjection of the Church to her heavenly Lord a new reason for wifely submission. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:18-25 The epistles most taken up in displaying the glory of the Divine grace, and magnifying the Lord Jesus, are the most particular in pressing the duties of the Christian life. We must never separate the privileges and duties of the gospel. Submission is the duty of wives. But it is submission, not to a severe lord or stern tyrant, but to her own husband, who is engaged to affectionate duty. And husbands must love their wives with tender and faithful affection. Dutiful children are the most likely to prosper. And parents must be tender, as well as children obedient. Servants are to do their duty, and obey their masters' commands, in all things consistent with duty to God their heavenly Master. They must be both just and diligent; without selfish designs, or hypocrisy and disguise. Those who fear God, will be just and faithful when from under their master's eye, because they know they are under the eye of God. And do all with diligence, not idly and slothfully; cheerfully, not discontented at the providence of God which put them in that relation. And for servants' encouragement, let them know, that in serving their masters according to the command of Christ, they serve Christ, and he will give them a glorious reward at last. But, on the other hand, he who doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he hath done. God will punish the unjust, as well as reward the faithful servant; and the same if masters wrong their servants. For the righteous Judge of the earth will deal justly between master and servant. Both will stand upon a level at his tribunal. How happy would true religion make the world, if it every where prevailed, influenced every state of things, and every relation of life! But the profession of those persons who are regardless of duties, and give just cause for complaint to those they are connected with, deceives themselves, as well as brings reproach on the gospel.</body></html>
