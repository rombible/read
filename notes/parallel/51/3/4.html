So we also note the especial reference to the "appearance of Christ" in the Pastoral Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm" title="That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;">2Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a>), and the constant revelation of it in the Apocalypse.<p>The whole passage forms a complete and magnificent picture of the spiritual life in Christ--the means of its beginning, the signs of its presence, and the hope of its close. It may be compared with the fuller yet hardly completer picture of Romans 8.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Christ shall be manifested, our</span> (or, <span class="accented">your</span>,) <span class="cmt_word">life, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>).

"Seeing him as he is" in his glory, "we shall be like him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>) in glory. At last the spiritual life of the soul will have its due organic expression, in a body perfect and heavenly as itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm">1 Corinthians 15:35-49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>). This is already the case with our human nature in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>); and the change will proceed from the Head to the members (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>), who will be conformed to his "body of glory," as now they are being conformed to his spiritual image (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9-11, 29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a>). The textual change from "your" to "our" is doubtful (see note on Colossians 2:13). Observe that "Christ" is repeated four times in the last four verses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 As Christians are freed from the ceremonial law, they must walk the more closely with God in gospel obedience. As heaven and earth are contrary one to the other, both cannot be followed together; and affection to the one will weaken and abate affection to the other. Those that are born again are dead to sin, because its dominion is broken, its power gradually subdued by the operation of grace, and it shall at length be extinguished by the perfection of glory. To be dead, then, means this, that those who have the Holy Spirit, mortifying within them the lusts of the flesh, are able to despise earthly things, and to desire those that are heavenly. Christ is, at present, one whom we have not seen; but our comfort is, that our life is safe with him. The streams of this living water flow into the soul by the influences of the Holy Spirit, through faith. Christ lives in the believer by his Spirit, and the believer lives to him in all he does. At the second coming of Christ, there will be a general assembling of all the redeemed; and those whose life is now hid with Christ, shall then appear with him in his glory. Do we look for such happiness, and should we not set our affections upon that world, and live above this?</body></html>
