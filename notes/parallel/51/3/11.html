"There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Jesus Christ." In comparing the passages (passing by the insertion here of "circumcision nor uncircumcision," which is simply explanatory of "Jew nor Greek") we notice in this--(1) The insertion of "barbarian, Scythian." This insertion is clearly intended to rebuke that pride of intellect, contemptuous of the unlearned, which lay at the root of Gnosticism. The "barbarian" was simply the foreigner (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11</a>); the "Scythian" was the savage, towards whom the contempt implied for the "barbarian" assumed explicitness, and reached its climax. (2) The omission of "male nor female." In the Oriental society, as in Galatia, the dignity of women needed to be asserted against supposed inferiority. In Greek or Graecised society, as at Corinth, Ephesus, and Colossae, the new "freedom" of the gospel was apt to be abused to license; hence it was rather the "subjection" of women which needed to be suggested. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.">1Corinthians 14:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.">1Timothy 2:11-15</a>.) (3) Whereas in the Galatian Epistle the stress is laid on the unity of all with one another in Christ, here (as usual) the great truth is that "Christ is all things and in all." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1Corinthians 15:28</a> we have this phrase applied to God, in contradistinction to the office of the Son in His mediatorial kingdom. Here it is in reference to that kingdom that it is used. In it Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>) "fills all in all;" and by His universal mediation all "life is hid with Him in God." He is all that can be needed, and that both "in all things" and "in all persons." But under both aspects the catholicity of the gospel is equally brought out; here by the direct union of all alike with Christ, there by the resulting unity of all with one another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where there is</span> (or, <span class="accented">can be</span>) <span class="cmt_word">no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-24.htm">Luke 22:24-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-12.htm">John 13:12-17</a>). That <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> means "can be," "negativing, not merely the fact, but the possibility," is doubtful in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-5.htm">1 Corinthians 6:5</a> (Revised Text). "In Christ" these distinctions are non-existent. There is no place for them. These and the following words indicate the sphere, as "unto knowledge" the end, and "after the image" the ideal or norm, of the progressive renewal to be effected in the Colossian believer. It can be carried on only where and so far as these distinctions are set aside. The "new man" knows nothing of them. The enmity between Greek and Jew being removed, the malice and falsehood that grew out of it will disappear (vers. 8, 9: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> "Jew" stands first, and the distinction of <span class="accented">sex</span> is added. The distinctions here enumerated appear as looked at from the Greek side. Only here in the New Testament does "Greek" precede "Jew" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>, etc.). "Barbarian" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>) and "Scythian" (only here in the New Testament) are together opposed to "Greek," and imply want of culture rather than alien nationality, the Scythian being the rudest of barbarians (see Lightfoot's full note). Such terms of contempt would, in Asia Minor, be commonly applied by Greeks to the native population. The party who affected philosophic culture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 23</a>) may, perhaps, have applied them to simple, uneducated Christians (see note on Colossians 1:28). (On "circumcision," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; and for the connection with ver. 9, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>.) For "bond" and "free," a division then pervading society universally, comp. Galatian list. Onesimus and Philemon are doubtless in the apostle's mind. On this relationship he enlarges in the next section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-4:1</a>). The four pairs of opposed terms represent distinctions <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of <span class="accented">race</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of <span class="accented">religious privilege</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of <span class="accented">culture</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> of <span class="accented">social rank</span>. <span class="cmt_word">But Christ is all things, and in all</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3, 10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32, 39</a>). "Christ" stands at the end of the sentence, with accumulated emphasis. The Church regards and values each man in his relation to Christ, and bids every other consideration bow to this. He is "all things" - our common centre, our standard of reference, and fount of honour, the stun of all we acknowledge and desire; and he is "in all" - the common life and soul of his people, the substance of all we experience and possess as Christians. The second "all" is masculine (so most commentators, from Chrysostom downwards), referring more specially to the classes just enumerated. Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>. (While he is "in all," it is equally true that all are "in him:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23, 26</a>.) Just as in the spiritual sphere, and in the relations between God and man, Christ is shown to be <span class="accented">all</span>, so that "principalities and powers" are comparatively insignificant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10, 15</a>); so in the moral sphere, and in the relations between man and man. All human distinctions, like all angelic offices, must pay homage to his supremacy, and submit to the reconciling unity of his kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.</body></html>
