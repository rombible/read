The only peculiarity of this passage is the strong emphasis laid on "the reward of the inheritance." "The reward" is in the original, <span class= "ital">a perfect recompense</span> or <span class= "ital">requital.</span> The "inheritance" is exactly that which no slave could receive; only a son could be an heir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>). Hence the slave on earth is recognised as a son in heaven. He "serves the Lord," but his service is the perfect freedom of sonship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye servants</span> (literally, <span class="accented">bondmen</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>be obedient in all things to your lords according to the flesh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-9.htm">Titus 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18-25</a>). The duties of <span class="accented">servants and masters</span> are prominent here (ver. 22- <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>), in view of the emphasis thrown upon the lordship of Christ; and partly, no doubt, with reference to the case of the runaway slave Onesimus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-9.htm">Colossians 4:9</a>; Epistle to Philemon) "Servant" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">bondman</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a> and commonly in St. Paul.

And they were undoubtedly numerous in the early Church. The gospel has always been welcome to the poor and oppressed. The attitude of St. Paul and of Christianity towards slavery claims consideration under the Epistle to Philemon; on this point see Lightfoot's 'Introduction.' Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a> (comp. vers. 7, 8) the apostle calls the master <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("lord") in reference to "the Lord Christ" (vers. 22 b, 24); elsewhere in the New Testament, as in common Greek, the opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>, etc.), "According to flesh," that is, "in outward, earthly relationship" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm">Romans 4:1</a>): Christ is <span class="accented">the Lord</span> in the absolute and abiding sense of the word (similarly, "in the flesh" and "in the Lord," <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not with acts of eye service</span> (literally, <span class="accented">not</span> <span class="accented">in eye services</span>)<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> as man pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-34.htm">Luke 11:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-2.htm">Psalm 123:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>). "Eye service" is plural here, according to Revised Text; singular in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>. Here the word <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> first oocurs in Greek, like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>). It strikes at the besetting sin of servants of all kinds. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("man pleaser") occurs in the LXX, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The servant whose aim it is to please his earthly master in what will catch his eye, plays a <span class="accented">double</span> part, acting in one way when observed, in another when left to himself; with this duplicity is contrasted "singleness of heart" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a> and 1 Cor 9:11, 13 has a different application). "Fearing the Lord" more than the eye of his earthly lord, the Christian servant will always act in "singleness of heart;" for "the eyes of the Lord are in every place." In the same manner the apostle ("bondman of Christ Jesus," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>) speaks of his own relations to men and to the Lord Christ respectively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4-6</a>, etc.: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37-44</a>). The reading "God" of Received Text is a copyist's emendation, a sample of a large class of corruptions of the text, where a word more familiar in any given connection is, more or less unconsciously, substituted for the original word. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:18-25 The epistles most taken up in displaying the glory of the Divine grace, and magnifying the Lord Jesus, are the most particular in pressing the duties of the Christian life. We must never separate the privileges and duties of the gospel. Submission is the duty of wives. But it is submission, not to a severe lord or stern tyrant, but to her own husband, who is engaged to affectionate duty. And husbands must love their wives with tender and faithful affection. Dutiful children are the most likely to prosper. And parents must be tender, as well as children obedient. Servants are to do their duty, and obey their masters' commands, in all things consistent with duty to God their heavenly Master. They must be both just and diligent; without selfish designs, or hypocrisy and disguise. Those who fear God, will be just and faithful when from under their master's eye, because they know they are under the eye of God. And do all with diligence, not idly and slothfully; cheerfully, not discontented at the providence of God which put them in that relation. And for servants' encouragement, let them know, that in serving their masters according to the command of Christ, they serve Christ, and he will give them a glorious reward at last. But, on the other hand, he who doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he hath done. God will punish the unjust, as well as reward the faithful servant; and the same if masters wrong their servants. For the righteous Judge of the earth will deal justly between master and servant. Both will stand upon a level at his tribunal. How happy would true religion make the world, if it every where prevailed, influenced every state of things, and every relation of life! But the profession of those persons who are regardless of duties, and give just cause for complaint to those they are connected with, deceives themselves, as well as brings reproach on the gospel.</body></html>
