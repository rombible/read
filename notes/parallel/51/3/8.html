(On "anger" and "wrath" (or "rage"), see ver. 6.) The latter is once ascribed to God by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>), more frequently in the Apocalypse. In man it is universally condemned. (For <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">malignity, badness of disposition</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a>; see Trench's 'Synonyms.') <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in its original sense, includes injurious speech of any kind, either against man or God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm">Romans 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-16.htm">Romans 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (only here in the New Testament) denotes, like the English "foul," either "scurrilous" or "filthy." The former kind of speech is suggested by the foregoing <span class="accented">blasphemia</span>; but especially in such an atmosphere as that of Greek city life, scurrility commonly runs into filthiness. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4</a>, where a slightly different word occurs, the latter idea is prominent. The two last vices, being sins of <span class="accented">speech</span>, must be put away "out of your mouth." "Your" bears the emphasis in the Greek; such utterance is quite unfit for <span class="accented">a Christian mouth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-10.htm">James 3:10</a>; and the prohibition of <span class="accented">lying in</span> the next verse). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.</body></html>
