The phrase is remarkable, apparently suggested by the claim to perfection, set up by the Gnostic teachers. They sought such perfection in knowledge peculiar to the few; St. Paul in the love which is possible to all.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>. "love" is the substance or substratum of the Christian virtues; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a> it is their head and beginning; here it is that which embraces and completes them. They imply love, but it is more than them all together. They lie within its circumference; wanting it, they fall to pieces and are nothing. (For <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> ("bond" or "band"), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a> we have the "bond of peace" (see next verse). Love is <span class="accented">the bond</span> in the active sense, as that <span class="accented">wherewith</span> the constituents of a Christian character or the members of a Church are bound together: peace, in a passive sense, as that <span class="accented">wherein</span> the union consists (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>). "Love" (compare "covetousness," ver. 5) is made conspicuous by the Greek definite article - being <span class="accented">that eminent, essential</span> grace of Christian love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>, etc.). "Perfectness" is genitive of object, not of quality: love unifies the elements of Christian goodness and gives them in itself their "perfectness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>). (For "perfectness," see note on "perfect," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; and comp. 4:12.) Against Galatian teachers of circumcision, and Corinthian exalters of knowledge, the apostle had magnified the supremacy of love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>); and so against the Colossian mysticism and asceticism he sets it forth as the crown of spiritual perfection, the goal of human excellence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-17 We must not only do no hurt to any, but do what good we can to all. Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.</body></html>
