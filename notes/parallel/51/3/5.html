There are, however, constantly emerging indications of independence of handling. Generally speaking, the Ephesian Epistle is fuller and deeper in treatment; and, moreover, it constantly brings out, in relation both to moral duty and to the observation of the relations of life, the great characteristic doctrine of the universal unity in Christ. This Epistle, on the other hand, is briefer and more incisive, and has only slight, though clear, indications of the idea so powerfully worked out in the other Epistle.)]<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5-9</a> contain the negative section of St. Paul's practical appeal, drawing out the consequences of the "death with Christ," in the mortification of all tendencies to impurity, malice, and falsehood. For these are the opposites to purity, love, and truth--the three great attributes of God, and therefore the three chief graces of man.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.</span>--The expression is doubly unique. It is the only passage where "mortification"--the killing of anything in us--is enjoined; and it is also notable, as not explicitly distinguishing between the members themselves, and the evil of which they are made the instruments. The sense is, of course, clear enough. It corresponds to the "crucifying the flesh" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-24.htm" title="And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.">Galatians 5:24</a>; and the idea of evil, mostly expressed plainly in the word "flesh," is here hinted in the phrase "which are on the earth," that is, which are busied with earth and bind us down to the earthly life. The particular word "members" is perhaps suggested by our Lord's command to "cut off the right hand" and "pluck out the right eye" if they cause us to offend (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.">Matthew 5:29-30</a>). But, as a rule, Scripture more clearly marks the distinction between the members and "the law of sin in the members" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.">Romans 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>); and we are usually bidden not to "kill our members," but to turn them from "instruments of unrighteousness" to be "instruments of righteousness unto God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>). The fact is that this passage contains only half the truth, corresponding to the death with Christ, and not the whole truth, including also the resurrection to the new life. Accordingly, as the next verse shows, the members to be mortified are actually identified with the vices of the old man residing in them.<p><span class= "bld">Fornication, uncleanness . . . covetousness, which is idolatry.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>, and Note there.<p><span class= "bld">Inordinate affection, evil concupiscence.</span>--These words are not found in the parallel passage. The word rendered "inordinate affection" is the general word for "passion" (<span class= "ital">pathos</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It is found united to "concupiscence" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1Thessalonians 4:5</a>, "the lust of concupiscence." Both words here are general words, denoting the condition of soul, of which "fornication" and "covetousness" are both exemplifications. This is the condition of unrestrained passion and desire, the former word implying a passive receptiveness of impression from without, the other the positive energy of desire to seek gratification. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-24.htm" title="And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.">Galatians 5:24</a>, "the affections" (<span class= "ital">passions</span>) and "lusts." Of such a temper Article IX. of the Church of England declares with singular accuracy, not that it is sin, but that it has in itself <span class= "ital">rationem peccati, </span>that is, the initial principle of sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make dead, therefore, the</span> (or, <span class="accented">your</span>) <span class="cmt_word">members that are upon the earth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>). "Your" is omitted by most textual critics, but English idiom requires it in translation. In its absence a stronger emphasis falls on the defining clause, "that are upon the earth." As these things may no longer be pursued or studied (vers. 1, 2), the organs devoted to them must be put to death. These <span class="accented">members</span> are indeed those of the actual body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>); but these <span class="accented">in so far as ruled hitherto by sinful impulse and habit</span>, constituting the body of "the old man" (ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>), "of the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), "of sin," and "of death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>), with "sinful passions working in its members, bearing fruit unto death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>): setup, note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>. <span class="accented">That</span> body is "made dead" by destruction of the evil passions that animated it. The body of "the new man" is physically identical with it, but different in moral habit and diathesis - a difference that manifests itself even in bodily expression and manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> occurs besides in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a> (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, a still stronger word is used of "the practices" of the body): as the aged Abraham had been <span class="accented">made dead</span> in respect of the natural possibility of fatherhood, so the body of the Christian is to be dead for purposes of sin. If there were any doubt as to the writer's meaning, the next clause removes it. His language has approached that of the philosophical ascetics (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, note and quotations); hence the abrupt explanatory apposition that follows: <span class="cmt_word">fornication, uncleanness,</span> (sensual) <span class="cmt_word">passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>). To these vices the Colossian Gentiles (some of them at least) had been to such a degree devoted that their <span class="accented">members</span> had become virtually identified therewith. The first two sins are related as particular and general. The second pair, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, are combined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> in contrast to "(bodily) sanctification and honour" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, and "passions of dishonour," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>). The former denotes a morbid, inflamed condition of the sensual appetite; the latter, craving for some particular gratification of it (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). Neither of these words is etymologically, or invariably, evil in sense. The degradation of such terms in all languages is a sad evidence of the corruption of our nature. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is both wider and more intense in meaning than our "covetousness." It denotes radically the disposition to "have more," "grasping greed," "selfishness grown to a passion." Hence it applies to sins of impurity, greediness for sensual pleasure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>); but by the emphatic use of the article ("the covetousness"), and by the words that follow, it is marked out as a distinct type of sin; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>, where "uncleanness" and "greed" are stigmatized as <span class="accented">vile</span> forms of sin. This word, often used by St. Paul, is peculiar to him in the New Testament. "The which" (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: setup. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>) gives a reason while it states a fact ("inasmuch as it is idolatry"). For the thought, setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; it is a commonplace of religion, and appears in Philo and Jewish rabbis (see Lightfoot). Lightfoot places a colon after "upon the earth," and supposes "fornication," etc., to be "proleptic accusatives," looking forward to some verb unexpressed, such as "put off" (ver. 8). But this is needless (see Winer, p. 666), and the command, "make dead your members," requires this qualifying explanation. The grammatical awkwardness of the apposition is not without rhetorical effect. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.</body></html>
