The opposite truth is asserted in ver. 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a> combines them both. The recompense of the faithful Christian slave is nothing less than "the inheritance" of God's children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 11, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>), which the apostle has so often under other terms assured to his readers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 23, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 15</a>). For a <span class="accented">slave</span> to be heir was "a paradox" (Lightfoot): see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>. No form of praise could be more cheering and ennobling to the despised slave than this. "In Christ," Onesimus is "no longer as a slave, but a brother beloved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>), and if a brother, then a joint heir with his master Philemon in the heavenly inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye serve the Lord Christ</span> (vers. 22, 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>); that is, <span class="accented">Christ is the Lord whose bondmen ye are.</span> "For" is probably a correct gloss, though a corrupt reading. Its insertion indicates that the sentence was read indicatively (Lightfoot, and R.V.); not imperatively ("serve the Lord Christ"), as Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, with the Vulgate, construe it. The verse amounts to this: "Work as for the Lord: he will repay you; you are his servants." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:18-25 The epistles most taken up in displaying the glory of the Divine grace, and magnifying the Lord Jesus, are the most particular in pressing the duties of the Christian life. We must never separate the privileges and duties of the gospel. Submission is the duty of wives. But it is submission, not to a severe lord or stern tyrant, but to her own husband, who is engaged to affectionate duty. And husbands must love their wives with tender and faithful affection. Dutiful children are the most likely to prosper. And parents must be tender, as well as children obedient. Servants are to do their duty, and obey their masters' commands, in all things consistent with duty to God their heavenly Master. They must be both just and diligent; without selfish designs, or hypocrisy and disguise. Those who fear God, will be just and faithful when from under their master's eye, because they know they are under the eye of God. And do all with diligence, not idly and slothfully; cheerfully, not discontented at the providence of God which put them in that relation. And for servants' encouragement, let them know, that in serving their masters according to the command of Christ, they serve Christ, and he will give them a glorious reward at last. But, on the other hand, he who doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he hath done. God will punish the unjust, as well as reward the faithful servant; and the same if masters wrong their servants. For the righteous Judge of the earth will deal justly between master and servant. Both will stand upon a level at his tribunal. How happy would true religion make the world, if it every where prevailed, influenced every state of things, and every relation of life! But the profession of those persons who are regardless of duties, and give just cause for complaint to those they are connected with, deceives themselves, as well as brings reproach on the gospel.</body></html>
