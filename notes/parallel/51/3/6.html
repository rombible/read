The latter phrase is cancelled by Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort; but retained by Ellicott and, preferentially, by the Revisers. The witnesses against it, though numerically few, are varied and select, and the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>) would suggest insertion of the words if originally absent. "The anger of God is coming" is a sentence complete in itself (setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). God's "anger" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>) is his settled punitive indignation against sin, of which his "wrath" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is the terrible outflaming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>); see Trench's 'Synonyms.' "Cometh" implies a continuing fact or fixed principle (see Winer, p. 332); or rather, perhaps, signifies that this "anger" is in course of manifestation, is "on the way:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>, "the anger that is coming," not "to come," also the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>. The objects of this anger ("children of wrath," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 3</a>) are "the sons of disobedience." The expressive Hebraism by which a man is said to be s <span class="accented">child</span> or <span class="accented">son</span> of the dominant quality or influence of his life is frequent in the New Testament. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.</body></html>
