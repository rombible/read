The phrase here is to be taken in its whole sense, both of "death to sin" and "death to the visible world."<p><span class= "bld">Your life is hid with Christ in God . . . Christ who is our life.</span>--In these two phrases, again, we pass from a lower to a higher expression of the same truth. (1) First, "our life is hid with Christ in God." The spiritual life in man is a "hidden life," having its source in God; the full conviction of it, as distinct from the mere instinctive consciousness of it in the mind itself, comes only from the belief that it is the image of God in us, and is sustained by constant communion with Him. If God be our God at all, we must live; for "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm" title="I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.">Matthew 22:32</a>). It is also "hid with Christ." Our Lord's ascent to His glory in heaven is at once the pledge and the means of this our spiritual communion with God. It is "with Him" that we can "in heart and mind ascend;" it is "with Him" that we can "continually dwell." (2) But this is not all. "Christ is our life" now as well as hereafter. This is simply a summary of the two truths;" Christ liveth in me (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), as the source of life; and "To me to live (the actual condition of life) is Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>). It is but a brief expression of faith in the truth which our Lord Himself declared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>), "I am the Life; whoso liveth and believeth in Me shall never die." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>.) Hence our spiritual life is not only a being "with Christ;" it is also unity with Christ in the bosom of the Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye died, and your life is hid, with Christ, in God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). In this <span class="accented">hidden life</span> of the Christian lies the ground and the spring of the more outward life of thought and endeavour of vers. 1, 2. And this <span class="accented">life</span> comes through <span class="accented">death</span>, from that "dying with Christ" out of which we "rose with him" (ver. 1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 4, 8</a>). "The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ('ye died') denotes the past act; the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ('hath been and is hid') the permanent effects" (Lightfoot). (On the nature of this <span class="accented">death</span>, see notes to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>.) <span class="accented">"Died</span> - and your <span class="accented">life!"</span> this paradox is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10, 11</a>, and repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>. The Christian's <span class="accented">life</span> is lodged in the sphere of "the unseen and eternal." It centres in <span class="accented">Christ</span>, and as he is <span class="accented">hidden</span> - withdrawn from the world of sense, yet with us always in his Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16-22</a>) - so our life <span class="accented">with him.</span> And if "with Christ," then "in God;" for "Christ is God's" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>); "lives to God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>), and "is at God's right hand" (ver. 1), being "the Son of his love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>). The apostle says, "in God" ("in heaven," <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>), to emphasize the fact of the union of Christ with God, or perhaps to deepen the reader's sense of the sacredness of this life in Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14-16</a>). "Is hid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3</a>), another allusion to the fondness of the Colossian errorists for <span class="accented">mysteries.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a> St. Paul spoke of the ancient mystery of a Christ for all the world; then of the new, perpetual mystery of a Christ dwelling within believing hearts. But this second mystery is equally that of <span class="accented">our life in Christ</span> as of <span class="accented">Christ's life in us</span>, lifting us to heaven while it brings him down to earth. This mutual indwelling of the Head in heaven and the members upon earth is the most intimate and inscrutable of all secrets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22, 23, 26</a>). "The world knows neither Christ nor Christians, and Christians do not even know themselves" (Bengel). But as the old historic secret had its manifestation at last (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>), so will the new secret that lies enfolded within every Christian life - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 As Christians are freed from the ceremonial law, they must walk the more closely with God in gospel obedience. As heaven and earth are contrary one to the other, both cannot be followed together; and affection to the one will weaken and abate affection to the other. Those that are born again are dead to sin, because its dominion is broken, its power gradually subdued by the operation of grace, and it shall at length be extinguished by the perfection of glory. To be dead, then, means this, that those who have the Holy Spirit, mortifying within them the lusts of the flesh, are able to despise earthly things, and to desire those that are heavenly. Christ is, at present, one whom we have not seen; but our comfort is, that our life is safe with him. The streams of this living water flow into the soul by the influences of the Holy Spirit, through faith. Christ lives in the believer by his Spirit, and the believer lives to him in all he does. At the second coming of Christ, there will be a general assembling of all the redeemed; and those whose life is now hid with Christ, shall then appear with him in his glory. Do we look for such happiness, and should we not set our affections upon that world, and live above this?</body></html>
