Of the new nature there are two marks--towards man love in all its various forms, towards God thanksgiving and living to His glory.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">The new man, which is</span> (<span class= "ital">being</span>) <span class= "bld">renewed.</span>--There are here the same two different words which are found in the parallel passage. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>). "The new man" is here properly the <span class= "ital">youthful man</span> "which is renewed," that is, to which is given a nature really fresh and new.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having put on the new</span> (man), <span class="cmt_word">which is being renewed unto</span> (full) <span class="cmt_word">knowledge, after</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">image of him that created him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). New (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is "young," "of recent date" (compare the "once," "but now" of vers. 7, 8; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1, 2</a>). whose birth was well remembered, and which presented so vivid a contrast to the "old man with his deeds." "Being renewed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, derived from the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) sets forth the other side of this newness, its <span class="accented">novelty</span> of quality and condition (compare "newness of life," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). And this participle is in the present tense (continuous), while the former is in the aorist (historical). So the notions are combined of <span class="accented">a new birth</span> taking place once for all, and a new <span class="accented">character</span> in course of formation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 24</a> these ideas are in the same order (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Full knowledge" was one purpose of this renewal, the purpose most necessary to be set before the Colossians. The nature and objects of this <span class="accented">knowledge</span> have been already specified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 9, 27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3, 9, 10</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-31</a>; and on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>). "After (the) image" is clearly an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a> ("after God"). It is adverbial to "renewed," not to "knowledge." Man's renewal in Christ makes him what the Creator at first designed him to be, namely, his own image (compare note on "reconcile," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). Chrysostom and others take "Christ" as "him that created," in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>; but then it is said that all things "were created <span class="accented">in</span>... <span class="accented">through</span>... <span class="accented">for</span> Christ," not absolutely that <span class="accented">Christ created</span> them. But "the image of God after which" man was created and is now recreated, is <span class="accented">seen</span> in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.</body></html>
