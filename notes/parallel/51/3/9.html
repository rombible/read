The imperatives of vers. 5 and 8 were aorists, enjoining a single, decisive act; this is present, as in vers. 1, 2, 15, 18, etc., giving a rule of life. Only in Colossians and Ephesians do we find the apostle give a general warning against <span class="accented">lying.</span> What reason there was for this we cannot tell; unless it lay in the <span class="accented">deceit</span> of the heretical teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>). The <span class="accented">lying</span> in question is uttered within the Church ("to one another"), and is fatal to its unity (ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-30</a>). The following aorist participles, "having stripped off" and "having put on" (ver. 10), may, grammatically, be part of the <span class="accented">command</span> - "strip off," etc., and "lie not" - as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>; or may state the <span class="accented">fact</span> on which that command is based. The latter view is preferable (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, English Version; but see Lightfoot); for the participles describe a change already realized - a change <span class="accented">of principle</span>, which has, however, still to be more fully carried out in <span class="accented">practice</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1, 3, 7, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-20.htm">Ephesians 4:20-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27, 28</a>): in ver. 12 the imperative mood is resumed with an emphatic "therefore," implying a previous reference to fact. (On the double compound <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "having stripped off (and put) away," see notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11, 15</a>.) The "Old man"; is the former self, the "I no longer living" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>) of the Colossian believer, to whom "the members that are upon the earth" (ver. 5) belonged - the entire sinful personality of "him who is in the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8</a>). His "deeds" ("practices," "habits of doing," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; see Trench's 'Synonyms' on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>) are the pursuits of which vers. 5, 8, 9 supply examples. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.</body></html>
