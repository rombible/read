But St. Paul is not content without noting their own active participation--"ye walked in them." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17-20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In which also ye walked once, when you were living in these</span> (things) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a>). Even retaining "sons of disobedience" in ver. 6, it seems better, with Alford, Lightfoot, and the English Version, to read <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="accented">neuter</span>, "in which," referring to the same antecedent (ver. 5)as "because of which" in ver. 6; not "amongst whom" (Ellicott, Meyer). The latter interpretation is against the general usage of "walk in" with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>), and seems to condemn the mere fact of living "amongst the sons of disobedience" (see, on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>). The parallel "because of which" (ver. 6) gives <span class="accented">also</span> its force: these sins are visited with the Divine anger, and <span class="accented">moreover</span> are the very sins in which the Colossians aforetime had lived; observe the same connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-10.htm">1 Corinthians 6:10, 11</a>. "Were living" stands opposed to "make dead" of ver. 5, and to "ye died" (ver. 3: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>); it marks the time when "the old man" (ver. 9), with his "earthly members" (ver. 5) was alive and active (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 9</a>, "sin came to life"). "In these things" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>: Revised Text) points to the things enumerated in ver. 6, with a mental gesture of contempt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.</body></html>
