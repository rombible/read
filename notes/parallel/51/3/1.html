We observe that this celebrated passage occupies a place at the close of the doctrinal portion of the Epistle, exactly corresponding to the even greater passage on the unity of the Church in God in the Epistle to the Ephesians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1-16</a>). It is unlike that passage, because, summing up the main teaching of this Epistle, it dwells simply on the close personal relation of all souls to God in Jesus Christ, who is at once "the image of God," and the one Mediator between God and man. It is like it (and like other passages of the Epistles of the Captivity) because it passes on from Christ risen to Christ in heaven: it takes for granted our being risen with Christ, and bids us in heart to ascend to heaven now, and look forward to the bliss of heaven in the hereafter.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">If ye then be risen</span> (rather, <span class= "ital">ye rose</span>) <span class= "bld">with Christ.</span>--In these words is marked the beginning of the spiritual life, referred evidently to baptism. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>.) It is a "resurrection with Christ" and in Christ; as such it is dwelt upon in detail in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1-14</a>. We may note that this phrase, implying a sudden passing from death unto life, accords more exactly with the idea of adult baptism, accepted in conscious faith, and leading at once to a new life; while the later phrase, "regeneration" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>), which speaks of the soul as passing, indeed, at once into a new condition, but as having only the undeveloped germ of the new life, corresponds more closely with the idea of the infant baptism, which gradually superseded the other. Here this spiritual resurrection is taken for granted, and the Apostle goes on at once to the next stage of the spiritual life.<p><span class= "bld">Christ.</span>--The name, four times repeated, has in all cases the article prefixed to it. Evidently it used emphatically to refer to our Lord, as our Mediator--our Prophet, Priest, and King.<p><span class= "bld">Seek those things which are above . . . set your affection on things above.</span>--Here we have the spiritual life in its continuance. It is described, (1) first, as "seeking the things above"--that is, looking, and so growing, to perfection. This characteristic is dwelt upon with great fulness and beauty in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:12-16</a>. (2) Next, in a still higher strain, as "setting our affection on the things above," or, more properly, <span class= "ital">catching the spirit of the things above, </span>being "heavenly-minded" already--anticipating heaven, not only in hope, but in tone and temper, seeing things as God sees them, and seeing all in relation to Him. On this we may again compare the great passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20-21</a>, on our "citizenship of heaven." Of such heavenly-mindedness we have, perhaps, the most perfect specimen in the calm and loving certainty of St. John's Epistles. (3) These two graces must be united In the one is the secret of growth, in the other the present earnest of perfection. Moreover, the higher grace must follow from the former; "for, where our treasure is, there will our heart be also."<p><span class= "bld">Where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</span>--The allusion is emphatic. Heaven is to us, in itself, a vague expression of unknown bliss. It is made definite to the Christian by the thought of Christ. in His glorified humanity, there enthroned in majesty, "preparing a place for us," and drawing us to be with Him. (Note a similar emphatic reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>, "He raised us up, and made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.")<p>This glorious idea of Christ in heaven, and heaven in Christ, runs through the whole book of the Revelation of St. John, from the opening Epistles to the last vision of glory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - SECTION VII. THE TRUE CHRISTIAN LIFE. The apostle, having delivered his attack on the system of error inculcated at Colossae, now passes from the controversial to the more practical purport of his letter. There is no break, however, in the current of his thought; for throughout this chapter he urges the pursuit of a practical Christian life in a sense and in a manner silently opposed to the tendencies of Gnosticizing error. How much more congenial was the task to which he now addresses himself we may judge, perhaps, from the ease and simplicity which mark the language of this chapter, as compared with the abrupt and seemingly embarrassed style of the last section. We may analyze the hortatory section of the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4:6</a>) as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>, urging the Colossians to maintain <span class="accented">a lofty spiritual life</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> vers. 5-8, <span class="accented">to put off</span> their old vices, <span class="accented">impurity, malice, falsehood</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> vers. 9-14, <span class="accented">to put on</span> the new Christian virtues, especially <span class="accented">gentleness, forgivingness, love</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> vers. 15-17, to let <span class="accented">the sovereign influence of Christ</span> sway their whole life - inward, social, secular; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> ver. 18 - <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>, enjoining the Christian discharge of their relative duties, as <span class="accented">wives and husbands, children and fathers, servants and masters</span>, under the sense of their allegiance to <span class="accented">the Lord Christ</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2-4</a>, exhorting to <span class="accented">constant prayer</span>, and especially for the apostle himself at the present juncture; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(g)</span> vers. 5, 6, to wise conduct and edifying speech <span class="accented">toward them that are without.</span> It will be seen how much more comprehensive and systematic is the view thus presented of Christian duty than that furnished by earlier Epistles; and how the ideas of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">supremacy of Christ, the unity of the Christian brotherhood</span>, and <span class="accented">the sacredness of the natural constitution of human life</span>, which were threatened by the rise of Gnosticism in Colossae, underlie the apostle's exposition of Christian ethics. Paragraphs (a) to (d) in the above analysis we have grouped together under the title given to this section; (e) demands a separate treatment; and (f) and (g) will finally be bracketed together. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If, therefore, ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at God's right hand; mind the things above, not the things upon the earth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-13.htm">Luke 12:13-40</a>). The apostle has already shown that when his readers, entering the gate of baptism, became Christians through faith in Christ, they <span class="accented">died with him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>), <span class="accented">were buried</span>, then <span class="accented">raised and made alive together with him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>): comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>. So they were restored to peace and favour with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13, 14</a>), severed from their old life of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), and set in the path of holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>). At the same time, they left behind all childish, tentative forms and notions ("rudiments") of religion, whether Jewish or non-Jewish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 11, 18, 20-23</a>). They became dead both from sin and from human modes of salvation. Both are included in "the things upon the earth," to which belong at once the grosser sensual forms of sin (ver. 5) with its "surfeiting of the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>), and that vaunted <span class="accented">philosophy</span>, which is after all earth born and earthward tending (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 20</a>), bringing the soul again into bondage to material things. The apostle lifts his readers into a new, heavenly sphere. He bids them make "the things above," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the things of Christ," the one object of their thought and endeavour. So they will master the flesh <span class="accented">by rising above it</span>, instead of fighting it on its own ground by ceremonial rite and ascetic regimen. "The things above" are no abstract, transcendental conception, as in the theology of St. Paul's opponents, for they are "where Christ is." The things "in the heavens" as well as those "upon the earth" were created "in him, through him, unto him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>); <span class="accented">there</span> he is Lord, even as <span class="accented">here</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). His presence gives distinctness and positiveness to the Christian's view of heaven, and concentrates his interests and affections there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>). "Seated" is placed with emphasis at the end of its clause, indicating the completeness of the Saviour's work and the dignity of his position (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; and see Pearson on the Creed, art. 6.). (For "the things above," see vers. 3, 4; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a> and Colossians 2:18 compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11-14, 20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16-5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>.) To "seek" these things is to strive that they may be ours in the future; to "mind" them is to occupy our thoughts with them in the present. (For the word "mind" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-7</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">minding</span>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a> it is rendered by "regard.") <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 As Christians are freed from the ceremonial law, they must walk the more closely with God in gospel obedience. As heaven and earth are contrary one to the other, both cannot be followed together; and affection to the one will weaken and abate affection to the other. Those that are born again are dead to sin, because its dominion is broken, its power gradually subdued by the operation of grace, and it shall at length be extinguished by the perfection of glory. To be dead, then, means this, that those who have the Holy Spirit, mortifying within them the lusts of the flesh, are able to despise earthly things, and to desire those that are heavenly. Christ is, at present, one whom we have not seen; but our comfort is, that our life is safe with him. The streams of this living water flow into the soul by the influences of the Holy Spirit, through faith. Christ lives in the believer by his Spirit, and the believer lives to him in all he does. At the second coming of Christ, there will be a general assembling of all the redeemed; and those whose life is now hid with Christ, shall then appear with him in his glory. Do we look for such happiness, and should we not set our affections upon that world, and live above this?</body></html>
