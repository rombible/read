It is God that justifies.">Romans 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-13.htm" title="Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.">Romans 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1Timothy 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm" title="These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.">Revelation 17:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Holy and beloved.</span>--Of such election there are here two signs. The elect are "holy," consecrated to God in thought and life; and "beloved," accepted and sustained in their consecration by His love. Both epithets belong to them as conformed to the image of Christ (Rev. 8:29); for He is "the Holy One of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-34.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are; the Holy One of God.">Luke 4:34</a>), who "sanctifies Himself for us, that we also may be sanctified in truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>); and He is also the "Beloved," the "Son of God's love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm" title="Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;">Ephesians 1:16</a>), and we are accepted in Him. The two epithets here seem intended to prepare for the two-fold exhortation following. They are "beloved," therefore they should love one another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12-15</a>); they are holy, therefore they should thank God and live to His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16-17</a>).<p>(12, 13) Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm" title="With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-1.htm" title="Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;">Ephesians 5:1-2</a>. The word "tenderhearted" in those passages corresponds to the "bowels (or, <span class= "ital">heart</span>) of mercies" here;" kindness" and "forgiveness," "humility," "gentleness," "forbearance," appear in both. But the enumeration here is more exact in order of idea. St. Paul starts with the natural and universal instinct of compassion or sympathy; he next dwells on "kindliness and lowliness of mind," which are closely akin, since readiness to oblige others grows naturally out of a self-neglectful humility; from these he passes to "gentleness and long-suffering "in case of injury, ready" to forbear and to forgive; lastly, from these particulars he rises to the general spirit of "love," ruling under "the peace of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put on, therefore, as elect of God, holy, [and] beloved</span> (vers. 9,14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>). The terms "elect," "holy" (same as "saints," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>; see note), "beloved," apply alike and separately to those addressed. Bengel, Meyer, Alford, Ellicott prefer to read "holy and beloved elect (ones);" but "holy" and "beloved" are used frequently by St. Paul as distinct substantive expressions, and indicate conditions ensuing on, rather than determining, <span class="accented">election.</span> Colossian believers are "elect" in virtue of an antecedent choice of them to salvation on the part of God, as those who would believe on his Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1, 2</a>). Their whole Christian standing springs from and witnesses to God's eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>) <span class="accented">election</span> of them - an election which, however, presumes faith on their part from beginning to end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-30.htm">Romans 9:30-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5-10, 17-24</a>). "Elect" and "called," with St. Paul, are coextensive terms: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a> (R.V.) with this passage, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26, 27</a>. To address the Colossian Christians as <span class="accented">elect</span> is to remind them of all that they owe to God's grace. "Elect" as chosen by God, they are "holy" as devoted to God. By the latter title they were first addressed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>); holiness is the essence of Christian character. That they should gain this character and appear in it at the last judgment was the purpose of Christ's atoning death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 22</a>), as it was the purpose of God's eternal election of believers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). "And" is marked as doubtful by Lightfoot, Westcott and Heft; "it is impossible not to feel how much the sentence gains in form by its omission" (Lightfoot). "Beloved" (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is the perfect participle passive; it describes the position of those who, carrying out by their present holiness the purpose of their past election, are the objects of God's abiding love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). This love dictated their election and set at work the means by which it should be secured (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9, 10</a>). As its purposes are increasingly fulfilled in them, it rests on them with an abiding complacency and satisfaction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21-23</a>). Christ is "the beloved One" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.), and those who are "in him" in their measure share the same title (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23-26</a>). But their choice by God and devotion to God, who is all love to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-39.htm">Romans 8:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>), must in turn beget a loving heart in them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A heart of pity, kindness, lowliness of mind, meekness, long suffering</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1, 2, 32-5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35, 36</a>). "The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> are properly the nobler viscera" rather than <span class="accented">the bowels.</span> The use of this figure, found three times in Philemon, is Hebraistic (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7, 12, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>), though similar expressions occur in Greek poets. "Pity" (or, "compassion") is an attribute of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a> ("pitiful") (On kindness, or kindliness, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a> - in each case following "long suffering;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>, where it is opposed to "severity" in God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4</a>, where it is ascribed to God in his dealing with men in Christ; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>.) It is synonymous with "goodness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>, etc.); but "goodness" looks chiefly to benefit intended or conferred, "kindness" to the spirit and manner of bestowal (see Trench's 'Synonym'). The objects of "pity" are the suffering and miserable; of "kindness," the needy and dependent. The "lowliness of mind" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18, 23</a> was something specious and to be guarded against; here it is the central and essential element of the true Christian temper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>), its self-regarding element (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>). It is linked with meekness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. "Pity" and "kindness," preceding "humility," relate to the claims of others upon us; "meekness" and "long suffering," to our bearing towards them. "Meekness," the opposite of rudeness and self assertion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>), is a delicate consideration for the rights and feelings of others, especially necessary in administering rebuke or discipline (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>), and conspicuous in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>). St. Peter marks it as a womanly virtue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). "Long suffering" is called forth by the conduct of "the evil and unthankful" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>, and note). St. Paul claims this quality for himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>). Throughout Scripture it is ascribed to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9, 15</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-17 We must not only do no hurt to any, but do what good we can to all. Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.</body></html>
