PERSONAL MESSAGES AND GREETINGS. St. Paul concludes his letter, first, by introducing to the Colossians its bearer, Tychicus, along with whom he commends to them their own Onesimus, returning to his master (vers. 7-9); then, according to his custom, he conveys greetings from his various friends and helpers present with him at the time, in particular from Mark, who was likely to visit them, and from Epaphras their own devoted minister (vers. 10-14); thirdly, he sends greeting to the neighbouring and important Church of Laodicea, specially mentioning Nympha, with directions to exchange letters with the Laodiceans, and with a pointed warning to Archippus, probably a Colossian, having some charge over that Church (vers. 15-17). Finally, he appends, with his own hand, his apostolic greeting and benediction (ver. 18). The personal references of this section, though slight and cursory, are of peculiar value, bearing themselves the strongest marks of genuineness, and decisively attesting the Pauline authorship of the Epistle. At the same time, we gather from them several independent facts throwing light on St. Paul's position during his imprisonment, and on his relations to other leading personages of the Church. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that relates to me</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the things concerning me</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant</span> (<span class="accented">bondman</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>will make known to you</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; 1:8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>). Tychicus appears first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, where he is called an "Asian" (of the Roman province of Asia, of which Ephesus was capital), along with Trophimus, who, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>, is styled "the Ephesian." He accompanied the apostle on his voyage to Jerusalem (A.D. 58), with a number of others representing different Churches, and deputed, as Lightfoot thinks, in conformity with the directions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3, 4</a>, to convey the contributions raised for "the poor saints at Jerusalem." Trophimus was with St. Paul in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>), and so, probably, his colleague (the words, "as far as Asia," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, are of very doubtful authority), he is now with the apostle in his imprisonment at Rome, about to be sent home with these two letters (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>), and in charge of Onesimus, on whose account the apostle sends a private letter to Philemon. In the interval between the first (present) and second imprisonment (2 Timothy), the apostle revisited the Asiatic Churches (so we infer from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>), and Tychicus rejoined him; for we find St. Paul proposing to send him to Titus in Crete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), and finally sending him from Rome once more to Ephesus (2 Timothy 6:12). These facts sustain the high terms in which he is here spoken cf. "In the Lord" belongs both to "minister" and "fellow servant." This language is almost identical with that used of Epaphras in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see notes). Tychicus is "minister" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), not to Paul himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), nor in the official sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, but "of Christ," "of the gospel," or "the Church" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), as St. Paul himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23, 25</a>). He is "a beloved brother" to his fellow believers, "a faithful minister" of the Lord Christ, and "a fellow servant" with the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-9 Ministers are servants to Christ, and fellow-servants to one another. They have one Lord, though they have different stations and powers for service. It is a great comfort under the troubles and difficulties of life, to have fellow Christians caring for us. Circumstances of life make no difference in the spiritual relation among sincere Christians; they partake of the same privileges, and are entitled to the same regards. What amazing changes Divine grace makes! Faithless servants become faithful and beloved brethren, and some who had done wrong, become fellow-workers of good.</body></html>
