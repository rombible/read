The context, as will be seen by reference, is different, and the idea also somewhat different. There the "strictness" and "wisdom" are to guard against excess or recklessness within; here the "wisdom" is to watch against external dangers and make full use of external opportunities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Walk in wisdom towards those without</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm">Titus 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>). (On "wisdom," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>, note; Colossians 1:28; 2:3; 3:16; this was a chief need of the Colossian Church.) "Those without," as opposed to Christians - "those within the pale;" a Jewish mode of expression (Lightfoot): comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>. From a different point of view, they are designated" the rest" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>. This injunction appears in a different form and position in Ephesians. Standing at the close of the writer's exhortations, and followed up by the direction of the next verse, it is more pointed and emphatic here. <span class="cmt_word">Buying up each</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>opportunity</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-32.htm">Luke 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a> the reason is added, "because the days are evil." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-8.htm">Daniel 2:8</a> (LXX) the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> ("to buy out" or "up," a word of the market) has precisely this sense and connection, and the idiom occurs in classical writers. The verb is middle in voice: "buying up for yourselves," "for your own advantage." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> the compound verb is somewhat differently used. <span class="accented">The opportunity</span> is the fit time for each step of a well-conducted walk, the precise juncture of circumstances which must be seized at once or it is gone. This wary promptitude is always needful in dealing with men of the world, both to avoid harm from them and in seeking to do them good. The latter thought, it may be, connects this verse and the next. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 No duties can be done aright, unless we persevere in fervent prayer, and watch therein with thanksgiving. The people are to pray particularly for their ministers. Believers are exhorted to right conduct towards unbelievers. Be careful in all converse with them, to do them good, and recommend religion by all fit means. Diligence in redeeming time, commends religion to the good opinion of others. Even what is only carelessness may cause a lasting prejudice against the truth. Let all discourse be discreet and seasonable, as becomes Christians. Though it be not always of grace, it must always be with grace. Though our discourse be of that which is common, yet it must be in a Christian manner. Grace is the salt which seasons our discourse, and keeps it from corrupting. It is not enough to answer what is asked, unless we answer aright also.</body></html>
