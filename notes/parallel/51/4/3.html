In Ephesians and Romans the apostle implores prayer for <span class="accented">himself</span> alone, and dwells on his personal circumstances. Here and in the Thessalonian letters he unites his fellow labourers with him in the request. <span class="cmt_word">That God may open to us a door for the word</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>). "The word" is the Word of God which the apostle preaches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>); and "a debt" is wanted, in his present difficulties, through which that Word may freely pass, such as he speaks of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>). It is fanciful to give "door" here the sense of "mouth." The "opening of my mouth," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>, expresses the subjective freedom (corresponding to "as I ought to speak," ver. 4); "the door for the word," the objective liberty desired by St. Paul in his imprisonment. <span class="cmt_word">To speak the mystery of Christ, because of which also I am bound</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-24</a>). Were his prison door once opened, the apostle would be able freely to preach the gospel to the Gentiles - for this "the mystery of Christ" chiefly signifies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3-7</a>.) (On "mystery," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>.) It is this very mission which makes him long for freedom, that keeps him a prisoner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm">Ephesians 3:13</a>). He is in the strange position of an "ambassador in chains" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9, 10</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>). This "I am bound" (singular) shows that the "for us" of the former clause designedly includes others with himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 No duties can be done aright, unless we persevere in fervent prayer, and watch therein with thanksgiving. The people are to pray particularly for their ministers. Believers are exhorted to right conduct towards unbelievers. Be careful in all converse with them, to do them good, and recommend religion by all fit means. Diligence in redeeming time, commends religion to the good opinion of others. Even what is only carelessness may cause a lasting prejudice against the truth. Let all discourse be discreet and seasonable, as becomes Christians. Though it be not always of grace, it must always be with grace. Though our discourse be of that which is common, yet it must be in a Christian manner. Grace is the salt which seasons our discourse, and keeps it from corrupting. It is not enough to answer what is asked, unless we answer aright also.</body></html>
