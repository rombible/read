The original is even more emphatic, "Luke the physician, the beloved one." Demas, on the contrary, is barely named. It is impossible not to pass on in thought to the last notice of the two by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.">2Timothy 4:10</a>), "Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world. . . . only Luke is with me."<p>On the relation of St. Luke to St. Paul, see <span class= "ital">Introduction to the Acts.</span> Here we need only remark that the emphatic mention of him as "the beloved physician" suggests the idea that it was both as physician and as friend that St. Luke, now, as in the last captivity, was with the Apostle. Though the captivity was not, according to ancient ideas, severe, it must have told upon his weak and shattered health.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Luke the physician, the beloved, saluteth you</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). This reference to Luke's profession is extremely interesting. We gather from the use of the first person plural in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10-17</a>, and again from Acts 20:5 to the end of the narrative, that he joined St. Paul on his first voyage to Europe and was left behind at Philippi; and rejoined him six years after on the journey to Jerusalem which completed his third missionary circuit, continuing with him during his voyage to Rome and his imprisonment. This faithful friend attended him in his second captivity, and solaced his last hours; "Only Luke is with me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). His being called "the physician" suggests that he ministered to the apostle in this capacity, especially as "his first appearance in St. Paul's company synchronizes with an attack of St. Paul's constitutional malady" (Lightfoot: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-15</a>; the illness referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</a> and 2 Cor 4:7-5:8 may partly have led to Luke's rejoining St. Paul in Macedonia). St Luke's writings testify both to his medical knowledge and to his Pauline sympathies. His companionship probably gave a special colouring to the phraseology and cast of thought of St. Paul's later Epistles. (On the relations of St. Luke and St. Paul, see a valuable Paper by Dean Plumptre in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 4. pp. 134-156.) "The beloved" is a distinct appellation, due partly to Luke's services to the apostle, but chiefly, one would suppose, to the amiable and gentle disposition of the writer of the third Gospel. It is not unlikely that he is "the brother" referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm">2 Corinthians 8:18, 19</a>. <span class="accented">Lucas</span> is a contraction for <span class="accented">Lucanus</span>; so that he was not the "Lucius" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, nor, certainly, the "Lucius my kinsman" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>, who was a Jew. He was probably, like many physicians of that period, a freedman; and, since freedmen took the name of the house to which they had belonged, may have been, as Plumptre conjectures, connected with the family of the Roman philosopher Seneca and the poet Lucan. <span class="cmt_word">And Demas</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>), who alone receives no word of commendation - a fact significant in view of the melancholy sentence pronounced upon him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>. His name is probably short for <span class="accented">Demetrius.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.</body></html>
