Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.">Mark 9:50</a>, "Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves." There the salt is spoken of as the preservative from corruption, and the warning against "corrupt" words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29</a> has been thought to point in the same direction. But the context appears certainly to suggest that the use of the salt is to teach "how to answer every man," and that this answer (like the "reason," or <span class= "ital">defence, </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>) is to be given to "those without." Probably, therefore, the "seasoning with salt" is to provide against insipidity (thus according to some extent with the classic usage of the word). Their speech is to be primarily "with grace," kindled by the true life of Christian grace in it; secondarily, however, it is to have good sense and point, so as to be effective for the inquirer or against the scoffer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - (Let) <span class="cmt_word">your speech</span> (literally, <span class="accented">word</span>) (be) <span class="cmt_word">always with grace, seasoned with salt</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm">Titus 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a>). "Word" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) has its common acceptation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm">Titus 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>. "With grace" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) gives the pervading element of Christian speech; as "in wisdom," of Christian behaviour (ver. 5). "Grace," here without the article, is not, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>, where the article should probably be read, "the (Divine) grace," but a property of speech itself, "gracefulness" the kindly, winning pleasantness which makes the talk of a good and thoughtful man attractive: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a> (44:3, LXX); <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:12</a> (LXX); Sir. 21:16. "Salt" is the "wholesome point and pertinency" (Ellicott) <span class="accented">seasoning</span> conversation, while grace <span class="accented">sweetens</span> it. The clause which follows indicates that "salt" denotes here, as commonly in Greek (instance the phrase, "Attic salt"), an intellectual rather than a moral quality of speech. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a> the connection is different, and the application more general (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49, 50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That you may know how you ought to answer each one</span> (ver. 4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>). The Colossians were to pray for the apostle that he might "speak the mystery of Christ... as he ought to speak;" and he bids them seek for themselves the same gift of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, liberty of speech and readiness to "every good word." For their faith was assailed by persuasive sophistry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8, 23</a>) and by brew-beating dogmatism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16, 18, 20, 21</a>). They were, like St. Paul, "set for the defence of the gospel," placed in the van of the conflict against heresy. They needed, therefore, "to have all their wits about them," so as to be able, as occasion required, to make answer to each of their opponents and questioners, that they might "contend" wisely as well as "earnestly for the faith." <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a> is a commentary on this verse: the parallelism is the closer because that Epistle was addressed to Churches in Asia Minor, where the debates out of which Gnosticism arose were beginning to be rife; and because, likewise, "the hope that was in them" was a chief object of the attack made on the Colossian believers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 23, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>). With this exhortation the Christian teaching of the Epistle is concluded. In its third and practical part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4:6</a>) the apostle has built up, on the foundation of the doctrine laid down in the first chapter, and in place of the attractive but false and pernicious system denounced in the second, a lofty and complete ideal of the Christian life. He has led us from the contemplation of its "life of life" in the innermost mystery of union with Christ and of its glorious destiny in him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>), through the soul's interior death-struggle with its old corruptions (vers. 5-11) and its investment with the graces of its new life (vers. 12-15), to the expression and outward acting of that life in the mutual edification of the Church (vers. 16, 17), in the obedience and devotion of the family circle (ver. 18 - <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>), in constant prayerfulness and sympathy with the ministers and suffering witnesses of Christ (vers. 2-4), and, lastly, in such converse with men of the world, and in the midst of the distracting debate by which faith is assailed, as shall fittingly commend the Christian cause. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 No duties can be done aright, unless we persevere in fervent prayer, and watch therein with thanksgiving. The people are to pray particularly for their ministers. Believers are exhorted to right conduct towards unbelievers. Be careful in all converse with them, to do them good, and recommend religion by all fit means. Diligence in redeeming time, commends religion to the good opinion of others. Even what is only carelessness may cause a lasting prejudice against the truth. Let all discourse be discreet and seasonable, as becomes Christians. Though it be not always of grace, it must always be with grace. Though our discourse be of that which is common, yet it must be in a Christian manner. Grace is the salt which seasons our discourse, and keeps it from corrupting. It is not enough to answer what is asked, unless we answer aright also.</body></html>
