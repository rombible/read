It indicates the deep anxiety of Epaphras for this beloved and endangered Church. There is nothing here to point to "outward toil" (Lightfoot), any more than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>. The apostle loves to commend his fellow labourers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20-22, 25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis</span> (vers. 15-17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). The Church in Hierapolis is added to that of Laodicea, singled out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a> as a special object of the apostle's concern (on these cities, see Introduction, &sect; 1). Whether Epaphras were the official head of these Churches or not, he could not but be deeply concerned in their welfare. Ver. 17 indicates the existence of a personal link between the Churches of Colossus and of Laodicea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.</body></html>
