The Received Text reads, by a slight confusion of similar Greek letters, <span class="accented">that he may know the things about you</span> (see Lightfoot's 'Notes on some Various Readings'). This is the only clause exactly identical in Colossians and Ephesians. There would be great anxiety on St. Paul's account amongst the Gentile Christians everywhere, and especially in the Asiatic Churches, after the ominous words of his address to the Ephesian elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-25</a>: comp. vers. 37, 38). The Colossians had sent through Epaphras messages of love to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>). To know that he was of good courage, and even in hope of a speedy release (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>), would "comfort their hearts." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-9 Ministers are servants to Christ, and fellow-servants to one another. They have one Lord, though they have different stations and powers for service. It is a great comfort under the troubles and difficulties of life, to have fellow Christians caring for us. Circumstances of life make no difference in the spiritual relation among sincere Christians; they partake of the same privileges, and are entitled to the same regards. What amazing changes Divine grace makes! Faithless servants become faithful and beloved brethren, and some who had done wrong, become fellow-workers of good.</body></html>
