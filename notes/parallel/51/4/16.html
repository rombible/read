Thus it was that they were "canonised," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>accepted as a part of the "canon" or rule of divine truth. The likelihood, or unlikelihood, of this public reading has an important bearing on the question of the authenticity of some of the books, which were placed among the "doubtful" by Eusebius and other ancient authorities. The fact that other books (such as our so-called Apocryphal books) were also publicly read was the cause of their being wrongly confused with the books of Holy Scripture.<p><span class= "bld">The epistle from Laodicea.</span>--The question, What was this "Epistle from Laodicea"? has given birth to a crowd of conjectures, of which an admirable and exhaustive examination will be found in Dr. Lightfoot's <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on this verse. But many of these may be at once dismissed. It seems perfectly clear, from the obvious parallelism of this Epistle from Laodicea with the Epistle to the Colossians itself, that it was a letter not from the Laodicean Church, not from any other Apostle, or Apostolic writer, but from St. Paul himself, either written at Laodicea, or (as is more likely) written to the Laodicean Church, and to be sent "from Laodicea" to Colossae. Hence the question is narrowed to a single alternative--(1) Is it an Epistle which has been lost, or, at any rate, not found in the canon? This is, of course, possible; it cannot be necessary, as it is certainly difficult, to suppose that all St. Paul's Epistles have been preserved to us in Holy Scripture. Now, there is extant an "Epistle to the Laodiceans," circulated in the West, and known only in the Latin, although it has been thought to bear traces of translation from a Greek original. This letter (for which see <span class= "ital">Excursus B.</span>) is obviously a forgery, probably not of early date, being little more than a tame compilation of phrases from St. Paul's Epistles. Putting this unhesitatingly aside, we may suppose the letter to have been lost. But this is a supposition merely arbitrary, and not to be adopted, except in default of something which has a better claim to attention. (2) Is it some other of St. Paul's known Epistles? The only letter which is noticed in our ordinary copies of the Greek Testament as written from Laodicea is the First Epistle to Timothy; but this is put out of the question, both in date and character; and, moreover, the very idea of a letter written from Laodicea at this time is negatived by St. Paul's declaration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>) that the Laodiceans had not seen his face in the flesh. A fourth century tradition declares our "Epistle to the Hebrews" to have been written to the Laodiceans; but (setting aside all question of the authorship) the whole character and argument of the Epistle make this extremely unlikely. Far the most probable supposition identifies it with our "Epistle to the Ephesians." For the reasons for supposing this an encyclical letter, see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> to that Epistle. In particular it should not be forgotten that Marcion expressly calls it an "Epistle to the Laodiceans." Laodicea lay lower down the valley, and was the larger town: an encyclical letter might well be left there to be sent on to Colossae. The two Epistles, as we have seen, have both strong likeness and marked distinction. Nothing could be more natural than that they should be interchanged, according to the direction of the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when this letter has been read among you, see to it</span> (literally, <span class="accented">cause</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that it be read also in the Church of</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Laodiceans</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>). For these two Churches were closely allied in origin and condition, as well as by situation and acquaintanceship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). The leaven of the Colossian error was doubtless beginning to work in Laodicea also. The words addressed to Laodicea in the Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>) bear reference apparently to the language of this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 41, etc. The phrase, "Church of Laodiceans," corresponds to that used in the salutation of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, but is not found elsewhere in St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">And that ye also read the letter from Laodicea.</span> What was this letter? Clearly <span class="accented">a letter from St. Paul</span> which would be received at Laodicea, and which the Colossians were to obtain from there. The connection of this sentence with the foregoing, and the absence of any other definition of the words, "the letter (from Laodicea)," make this evident. Nothing further can be affirmed with certainty. But several considerations point to the probability that this missing Epistle is none other than our (so-called) Epistle to the Ephesians. For: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Both letters were sent at the same time, and by the same messenger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The relation between the two is more intimate than exists between any other of St. Paul's writings; they are <span class="accented">twins</span>, the birth of the same crisis in the condition of the Church and in the apostle's own mind. Each serves as a commentary on the other. And there are several important topics, lightly touched upon in this letter, on which the writer dilates at length in the other (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a> <span class="accented">b</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> <span class="accented">b</span>-25 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> <span class="accented">a</span>, 24 <span class="accented">b</span>, 2:19 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-16, 5</a>:23-32; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 27, 2</a>:11-13, 3:11 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> ("Firstborn out of the dead"), 2:12 <span class="accented">b</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a> ("God's elect") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18, 19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>). On the other hand, the main arguments of the Colossian letter are, as it seems, assumed and presupposed in the Ephesian (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10, 20</a> <span class="accented">b-</span>23, 2:20 <span class="accented">b</span>, 3:8 <span class="accented">b-</span>11, 19 <span class="accented">b</span>, 4:13 <span class="accented">b</span> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20, 2</a>:9, 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8, 16-23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x1ff3;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a> are of doubtful authenticity; and there is much in the internal character of that Epistle to favour the hypothesis, proposed by Archbishop Usher, that it was <span class="accented">a circular letter</span>, destined for a number of Churches in Asia Minor, of which Ephesus may have been the first and Laodicea the last (compare the <span class="accented">order</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>.). In that case a copy of the Ephesian Epistle would be left at Laodicea by Tychicus on his way to Colossae. (See Introduction, &sect; 6; compare that to Ephesians.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Marcion, in the middle of the second century (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:11, 17), entitled the Epistle to the Ephesians, "To the Laodiceans." It does not appear that his heretical views could have been furthered by this change. Probably his statement contains a fragment of ancient tradition, identifying the Epistle in question with that referred to by St. Paul in this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The expression, "the letter <span class="accented">from Laodicea</span>," would scarcely be used of a letter addressed simply <span class="accented">to the Laodiceans</span> and belonging properly to them; but would be quite appropriate to a more general Epistle transmitted from one place to another. There is extant in Latin a spurious epistle 'Ad Laodicenses,' which is traced back to the fourth century, and was widely accepted in the Middle Ages; but it is "a mere cento of Pauline phrases, strung together without any definite connection or any clear object" (Lightfoot). (On this curious forgery, and on the whole subject of "the Epistle from Laodicea," see Lightfoot's masterly discussion, pp. 274 - 300; also p. 37.) Meyer, on the other hand, in his 'Introduction to Ephesians,' pronounces strongly against "the circular hypothesis." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.</body></html>
