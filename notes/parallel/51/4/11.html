In this case it is curious that one who bore our Lord's name should also have been known by a surname which was His peculiar title, "the Just One." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm" title="Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.">Luke 23:47</a>.) Of this Justus there is no other notice, not even in the Epistle to Philemon, in which all the other names recur.<p><span class= "bld">Who are of the circumcision. These only . . .</span>--The juxtaposition of the two notices seems to indicate--what is in itself likely--that the brethren who held aloof from St. Paul in "strife and envy," and whose conduct produced that sense of isolation of which he speaks so pathetically in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Philippians 2:20</a>, were "of the circumcision." Out of them, only Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus were true fellow-workers, and as such "a comfort" to the Apostolic labourer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, called Justus</span> - the only name of this list wanting in Philemon. Nor is this person mentioned elsewhere. "Jesus" ("Joshua," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>) was a common Jewish name. "Justus" ("just," "righteous") was frequently adopted by individual Jews, or conferred on them, as a Gentile (Latin) surname (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-7.htm">Acts 18:7</a>); it implied devotion to the Law, and was the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Zadok</span> (see Lightfoot). Its Greek equivalent, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> the standing epithet of James, the brother of the Lord, and the head of the Church at Jerusalem; and is emphatically applied to Christ himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who are of the circumcision, - these only</span> (my) <span class="cmt_word">fellow workers unto the kingdom of God,</span> (men) <span class="cmt_word">who have been a comfort to me</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-1.htm">Philemon 1:1, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 9, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>). Aristarchus, therefore, was a Jew, as well as Mark and Jesus Justus. "These only," etc., must be read as in close apposition to the previous clause. This statement accords with the apostle's complaint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-24</a>; but the still stronger language of the latter passages seems to point to a later time when he was yet more solitary, having lost Tychicus and Mark, and perhaps Aristarchus also, and when he had a more definite prospect of release. The title "fellow worker" he frequently confers on his associates (see references). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> it is applied, to Luke and Demas also. "The kingdom of God" was, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>, "the kingdom of his Son;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a> it is "the kingdom of Christ and God." On his arrival at Rome, St. Paul is described as "testifying, and preaching <span class="accented">the kingdom of God"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-23.htm">Acts 28:23, 31</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>).

If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.</body></html>
