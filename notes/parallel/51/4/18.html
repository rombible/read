This invariable autograph salutation was "Grace be with you" in various forms, from the brevity of the text here to the fulness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.">2Corinthians 1:2</a>, which has become the universal Christian blessing. In different epistles it is associated with different phrases of blessing; or charge. Thus we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1Corinthians 16:22</a>, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema." In the Epistle to the Galatians the autograph conclusion is expanded into a long postscript (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11-18</a>). This may have been the case in the cognate conclusion (2 Corinthians 10-13) of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, possibly from the words, "Now I Paul myself," &c. Here there is the simple and touching addition--<p><span class= "bld">Remember my bonds.</span>--In what spirit they were to be remembered we may gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Philippians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Philippians 2:17</a>. St. Paul evidently does not disdain to use his captivity as an appeal for sympathy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm" title="Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.">Philemon 1:9</a>); but mainly he dwells on it as a "glory" both to himself and to his converts. In both these different aspects it may be that he regarded it himself, according as he looked upon it "after the flesh" in the natural feeling of humanity, or "after the spirit," in the higher power of the grace of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The salutation with mine own hand - of Paul</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-21.htm">1 Corinthians 16:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11-18</a>). So the apostle appends his authenticating signature to the letter, written, as usual, by his amanuensis, himself inscribing these last words (see parallel passages). The Epistle to Philemon he appears to have penned himself throughout (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Remember my bonds</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).

The apostle's final benediction in all his Epistles; here in its briefest form, as in 1 and 2 Timothy. In the Ephesian benediction "grace" is also used absolutely. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a> gives the formula in its full liturgical amplitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.</body></html>
