In the two epithets--perfect and fully established in conviction--we may again trace, as before, reference to the pretensions of the Gnostic teachers to exclusive perfection in wisdom. St. Paul's true fellow-worker, like himself, prays that this perfection may belong to all, and that it may have its basis not is the secrets of heavenly knowledge, but in the revealed "will of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Epaphras, who is</span> (one) <span class="cmt_word">of you, saluteth you, a servant</span> (<span class="accented">bondman</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of Christ Jesus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1.htm">Jude 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3, 6</a>).

If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.</body></html>
