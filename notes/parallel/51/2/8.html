Now, (1) <span class= "ital">the character of that error in itself</span> is described with apparently intentional vagueness, as "a philosophy of vain deceit," "after tradition of men," after "the rudiments of this world." Even its Judaic origin, which is made clear below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16-17</a>), is here only hinted at in the significant allusion to Circumcision, and perhaps in the phrase "the rudiments of the world," which is also used of the Judaism of Galatia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>). (2) What is brought out vividly and emphatically is <span class= "ital">the truth which it contradicts or obscures.</span> First, the full indwelling Godhead of Christ and His headship over all created being; and next, as derived from this, our own "spiritual circumcision in Him, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the true "death unto sin and new life unto righteousness" in Him who is the One Atonement for all sin, and the One Conqueror of all the powers of evil. On the relation of the Epistle to Gnosticism see <span class= "ital">Excursus A.</span><p>(8) <span class= "bld">Spoil you.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">lead you away as a spoil, </span>triumph over you as a captive, and make you a slave. Comp. St. Paul's language as to the older Judaism at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.">2Corinthians 11:20</a>), "Ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face."<p><span class= "bld">Philosophy and vain deceit</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> (like "the knowledge falsely so called" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>), a philosophy which is inseparably connected with vain deceit. The warning implied here seems to be two-fold:--(1) First, against considering Christianity primarily as a "philosophy," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a search for and knowledge of speculative truth, even the highest. That it involves philosophy is obvious, for it claims to solve for us the great problem of Being, in Nature, in Man, and in God. St. Paul, while he depreciates the wisdom of this world, dwells emphatically on the gospel as the "wisdom of God." (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6-16</a>.) In this Epistle in particular he speaks of "wisdom" again and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-6.htm" title=" Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.">Colossians 4:6</a>) as one great characteristic of Christian life. Nor is it less clear (as the ancient Greek commentators here earnestly remind us) that Christianity finds a place and a blessing for all true philosophy of men, and makes it, as St. Paul made it at Athens, an introduction to the higher wisdom. But Christianity is not a philosophy, but a life--not a knowledge of abstract principles, but a personal knowledge of faith and love of God in Christ. (2) Next, against accepting in philosophy the "vain deceit" of mere speculation and imagination instead of the modest, laborious investigation of facts. This is the "knowledge falsely so called"; of this it may be said (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>) that it "puffs up," and does not "build up." In ancient and modern times it has always confused brilliant theory with solid discovery, delighting especially to dissolve the great facts of the gospel into abstractions, which may float in its cloudland of imagination.<p><span class= "bld">After the tradition of men.</span>--This is the keynote of our Lord's condemnation of the old Pharisaic exclusiveness and formalism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-6.htm" title="And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.">Matthew 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-8.htm" title="For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you do.">Mark 7:8-9</a>); it is equally the condemnation of the later Jewish, or half-Jewish, mysticism which St. Paul attacks here. It is hardly necessary to remark that the Apostle often claims reverence for "traditions" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm" title="For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.">2Peter 2:21</a>), but they are traditions having their starting point in direct revelation of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>), and, moreover, traditions freely given to all, as being His. The "traditions of men" here condemned had their origin in human speculation, and were secretly transmitted to the initiated only.<p><span class= "bld">The rudiments of the world.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm" title="But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.">Galatians 4:2</a>, and Note there. This marks the chief point of contact with the earlier Judaism, in the stress still laid, perhaps with less consistency, on matters of ritual, law, ascetic observance, and the like. These are "of the world," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>belonging to the visible sphere; and they are "rudiments," fit only for the elementary education of those who are as children, and intended simply as preparation for a higher teaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-15.</span> - SECTION V. THE CHRISTIAN'S COMPLETENESS IN CHRIST. The apostle has first defined his own doctrinal position in the theological deliverance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, and has then skilfully brought himself into suitable personal relations with his readers by the statements and appeals of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23-2:7</a>. And now, after a general indication in ver. 4 of the direction in which he is about to strike, he unmasks the battery he has been all the while preparing, and delivers his <span class="accented">attack on the Colossian error</span>, occupying the rest of this second chapter, he denounces <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> its false philosophy of religion (vers. 8-15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its arbitrary and obsolete ceremonialism (vers. 16, 17); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its visionary angel worship (vers. 18, 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> its ascetic rules (vers. 20-22; ver. 23) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>reviewing the whole system in a brief characterization of its most prominent and dangerous features. It will be convenient to treat separately the first of these topics, under the heading already given, which indicates the positive truth developed by St. Paul in antagonism to the error against which he contends - a truth which is the practical application of the theological teaching of the first chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware lest there shall be some one who maketh you his spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit</span> (vers. 4, 18, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). "Beware;" literally, <span class="accented">see</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> it), a common form of warning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>). The future indicative" shall be," used instead of the more regular subjunctive "should be," implies that what is feared is too likely to prove the case (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> and (with another tense) <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>). "Some one who maketh (you) his spoil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)" is an expression so distinct and individualizing that it appears to single out a definite, well known person. The denunciations of this Epistle are throughout in the <span class="accented">singular</span> number (vers. 4, 16, 18), in marked contrast with the <span class="accented">plural</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, and that prevails in the apostle's earlier polemical references. It is in harmony with the philosophical, Gnosticizing character of the Colossian heresy that it should rest on the authority of some single teacher, rather than on Scripture or tradition, as did the conservative legalistic Judaism. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, a very rare word, <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span> in the New Testament, bears its meaning on its face. It indicates the selfish, partisan spirit, and the overbearing conduct of the false teacher. Against such men St. Paul had forewarned the Ephesian elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>). "And empty deceit" stands in a qualifying apposition to "philosophy:" "His philosophy, indeed! "It is no better than a vain deceit." This kind of irony we shall find the writer using with still greater effect in ver. 18. <span class="accented">Deceit is empty</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>; distinguish from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">fruitless, vain</span>), which deceives by being a show of what it is not, <span class="accented">a hollow pretence.</span> From the prominence given to this aspect of the new teaching, we infer that it claimed to be a <span class="accented">philosophy</span>, and made this its special distinction and ground of superiority. And this consideration points (comp. Introduction, &sect; 4), to some connection between the system of the Colossian errorists and the Alexandrine Judaism, of which Philo, an elder contemporary of St. Paul, is our chief exponent. The aim of this school, which had now existed for two centuries at least, and had diffused its ideas far and wide, was to transform and sublimate Judaism by interpreting it under philosophical principles. Its teachers endeavoured, in fact, to put the "new wine" of Plato into the old bottles" of Moses, persuading themselves that it was originally there (comp. note on "mystery," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). In Philo, <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is the name for true religion, whose essence consists in the pursuit and contemplation of pure spiritual truth. Moses and the patriarchs are, with him, all "philosophers;" the writers of the Old Testament" philosophize;" it is" the philosophical man" who holds converse with God. This is the only place where <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is expressly mentioned in the New Testament; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a> and context it is, however, only verbally wanting. According to the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ (vers. 17, 20, 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>). This clause qualifies "making spoil" (Meyer, Ellicott) rather than "deceit;" human authority and natural reason furnish the principles and the method <span class="accented">according to</span> which the false teacher proceeds. "Tradition" does not necessarily imply antiquity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>); "of men" is the emphatic part of the phrase. These words are characteristic of St. Paul, who was so profoundly conscious of the supernatural origin of his own doctrine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>). Similarly, "the rudiments of the world" are the crude beginnings of truth, the childishly faulty and imperfect religious conceptions and usages to which the world had attained apart from the revelation of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>). It is not either Jewish or non-Jewish <span class="accented">elements</span> specifically that are intended. Jew and Greek are one in so far as their religious ideas are "not according to Christ." Greek thought had also contributed its <span class="accented">rudiments</span> to the world's education for Christ: hence, comprehensively, "the rudiments of <span class="accented">the world</span> "(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). The blending of Greek and Jewish elements in the Colossian theosophy would of itself suggest this generalization, already shadowed forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Neander, Hofmann, and Klopper (the latest German commentator), have returned to the view that prevailed amongst the Fathers, from Origen downwards, reading this phrase, both here and in Galatians, in a physical sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>; the <span class="accented">elementa mundi</span>, "the powers of nature," "heavenly bodies," etc., worshipped by the Gentiles as gods, and which the Jews identified with the angels (ver. 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>) as God's agents in the direction of the world. This interproration has much to recommend it, but it scarcely harmonizes with the parallel "tradition of men," still less with the context of ver. 20, and is absolutely at variance, as it seems to us, with the argument involved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Not the doctrine of Christ, but <span class="accented">Christ himself</span> is the substitute for these discarded <span class="accented">rudiments</span> (vers. 17, 20). His Person is the norm and test of truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-3</a>). The views combatted were "not according to Christ," for they made him something less and lower than that which he is. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
