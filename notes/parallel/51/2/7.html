The cup of faith, filled to the full, runs over in that thanksgiving which is the expression both of faith and love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rooted and builded up in him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-20.htm">Jude 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47, 48</a>). "Rooted" is perfect participle, in, plying an abiding fact ("fast rooted"); while "builded up" (literally, <span class="accented">upon</span> or <span class="accented">unto</span>) is in the present tense of a continued process, the prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> also implying growth and gain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>). Meyer and Ellicott view <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> as a mere complement of the latter participle: "being builded in him." This weakens the force of both prepositions (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>), and the emphasis of the repeated "in him." The ideas of <span class="accented">planting</span> and <span class="accented">building are</span> similarly combined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>; and <span class="accented">rooted</span> is a figure applied to buildings in ether Greek writers (Lightfoot). "Christ is the ground for the roots below, and the foundation for the building above" (Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">And stablished in</span> (or, by) <span class="cmt_word">your faith, according as ye were taught</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5-7, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-6.htm">1 Corinthians 1:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9, 10</a>). '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> ("faith") is struck out in the Revised Text, and is probably a correct gloss. The instrumental dative, preferred by Meyer and Lightfoot, does not accord so well with ver. 5 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>). "Stablished" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">being kept firm</span>) is present in tense, like "builded up" (ver. 6, see note): comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-9.htm">Hebrews 13:9</a>; and distinguish from <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to make stable, fix firmly.</span> In "as ye were taught" the apostle reminds his readers again of their first lessons in the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5-7</a>, see notes; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abounding in it, with thanksgiving;</span> or, <span class="accented">abounding in thanksgiving</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>). The Revisers relegate "in it (your faith)" to the margin, following the judgment of Tischendorf and Tregelles; while Westcott and Hort, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, retain the words in the text. The reading "in him," found in the Vulgate and leading Western documents, throws doubt on these words; but it is difficult to see why they should have been inserted if not authentic, and they might easily be confused by a copyist with the foregoing "in him." The second <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, if <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> be retained, becomes <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span>, and may be rendered "with," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>. (On "thanksgiving," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.</body></html>
