Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>) "the life of sin"; or it may be the outward and visible life "of the world." The latter is the sense to be taken here. This outward life is under "ordinances" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>), under the "rudiments of the world" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>), or, generally, "under law." Of such a life St. Paul says (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>), "I through the Law died to the Law, that I might live unto God." There (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>), as here, he brands as unspiritual the subjection to the "weak and beggarly elements" of mere ordinances. Of course it is clear that in their place such ordinances have their value, both as means to an end, and as symbols of an inner reality of self-devotion. The true teaching as to these is found in our Lord's declaration to the Pharisees as to spiritual things and outward ordinances, "These things (the spiritual things) ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others (the outward observances) undone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>). In later times St. Paul declared with Judicial calmness, "The Law is good if a man use it lawfully" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-8.htm" title="But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;">1Timothy 1:8</a>). But to exalt these things to the first place was a fatal superstition, which, both in its earlier and later phases, he denounces unsparingly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The apostle's fourth and last warning is directed against <span class="accented">ascetic rules of life.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world</span> (vers. 8, 10-13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-17</a>). "Therefore" is struck out by the Revisers on the best authority. It would imply a logical dependence of this verse upon the last, which does not exist. This warning, like those of vers. 16, 18, looks back to the previous section, and especially to vers. 8, 10, 12. It is a new application of St. Paul's fundamental principle of the union of the Christian with Christ in his death and resurrection (see notes, vers. 11, 12). Accepting the death of Christ as supplying the means of his redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14, 22</a>), and the law of his future life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>), the Christian breaks with and becomes <span class="accented">dead</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> and) <span class="accented">from</span> all other, former religious principles; which appear to him now but childish, tentative gropings after and preparations for what is given him in Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm">Galatians 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>). On "rudiments," see note, ver. 8. There these "rudiments of the world" appear as general ("philosophical") principles of religion, intrinsically false and empty; here they are moral rules of life, mean and worthless substitutes for "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus." (For the Pauline idiom, "died from (so as to be separate, or free from)," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Why, as</span> (men) <span class="cmt_word">living in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">world, are you made subject to decrees</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). To adopt the rules of the new teachers is to return to the worldly, pre-Christian type of religion which the Christian had once for all abandoned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>). "World" bears the emphasis rather than "living" ("having one's principle of life:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>). Standing without the article, it signifies "the world as such," in its natural character and attainments, without Christ (ver. 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (the verb only here in the New Testament) is passive rather than middle in voice (Winer, p. 326; see Meyer <span class="accented">in loc.</span>); literally, <span class="accented">why are yon being dogmatized, overridden with decrees?</span> Compare "spell" (ver. 8), "judge" (ver. 16), for the domineering spirit of the false teacher. The "dogmas" or "decrees" of ver. 14 (see note) are those of the Divine Law; these are of human imposition (vers. 8, 22), which their authors, however, seem to put upon a level with the former. In each case the <span class="accented">decree</span> is an external enforcement, not an inner principle of life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.</body></html>
