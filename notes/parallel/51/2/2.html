The <span class="accented">heart</span>, in Biblical language, is not the seat of feeling only, but stands for the whole inner man, as the "vital centre" of his personality (see Back's 'Biblical Psychology:' comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">While they are</span> (literally, <span class="accented">they having been</span>) <span class="cmt_word">drawn together in love, and into all</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">riches of the full assurance of the understanding, unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">into</span>) (full) <span class="cmt_word">knowledge of the mystery of God,</span> (even) <span class="cmt_word">Christ</span> (ver. 19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2, 3, 15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>). In the best Greek copies "drawn together" is nominative masculine, agreeing with "they," the logical subject implied in "their <span class="accented">hearts"</span> (feminine). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> has the same sense in ver. 19 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a> it is quoted from the LXX in another sense; and it has a variety of meanings in the Acts. "Drawn together" expresses the double sense which accrues to the verb in combination with the two prepositions "in" and "into:" "united <span class="accented">in</span> love," Christians are prepared to be "led <span class="accented">into</span> all the wealth of Divine knowledge." This combination of "love and knowledge" appears in all St. Paul's letters of this period (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; and contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2, 8-13</a>). "The riches of the full assurance," etc., and "the knowledge of the mystery" are the counterpart of "the riches of the glory of the mystery," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; the fulness of conviction and completeness of knowledge attainable by the Christian correspond to the full and satisfying character of the revelation he receives in Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-19</a>). (On "understanding," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>.) "Full assurance," or "conviction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), is a word belonging to St. Luke and St. Paul (with the Epistle to the Hebrews) in the New Testament (not found in classical Greek), and denotes radically "a bringing to fall measure or maturity." Combined with "understanding," it denotes the ripe, intelligent persuasion of one who enters into the whole wealth of the "truth as it is in Jesus" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>, R.V.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a> and Romans 14:5, for corresponding verb). In this inward "assurance," as in a fortress, the Colossians were to entrench themselves against the attacks of error (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>, and notes). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is either in explanatory apposition to the previous clause, or rather donors the <span class="accented">further purpose</span> for which this wealth of conviction is to be sought: "knowledge of the Divine mystery, knowledge of Christ" - this is the supreme end, ever leading on and upward, for the pursuit of which all strengthening of heart and understanding are given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The Revisers have corrected the erroneous "acknowledgment" by their paraphrastic rendering, "that they may know." (On <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 3), see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>.) The object of this knowledge is the great <span class="accented">manifested mystery</span> of God, namely <span class="accented">Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). We confidently accept here the Revised reading, that of nearly all recent textual critics, which omits the words found in the Received Text between "God" and "Christ." There are extant eleven distinct variations of this reading, and that of the Textus Receptus is, to all appearance, the latest and worst; "the passage is altogether an instructive lesson on textual criticism" (Lightfoot, pp. 252, 253; also Westcott and Hort, 'Introduction: Notes on Selected Readings,' pp. 125, 126). The words thus read have been interpreted mystery of the God Christ" (the Latin Hilary, and a few moderns); of the God of Christ" (Meyer, quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>); - both interpretations grammatically correct, but unsuitable here, even if in harmony with Pauline usage elsewhere. Alford omits "of Christ" altogether, distrusting the textual evidence. Meyer objects to the rendering we have followed (that of Ellicott, Lightfoot, Revisers), that the apostle, if this be his meaning, has expressed himself ambiguously; but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a> (see note); also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, "The mystery, <span class="accented">who was</span> manifested in flesh." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.</body></html>
