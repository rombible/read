The first is simply the trust in obsolete Jewish ordinances (the mere shadow of Christ) with which we are familiar in the earlier forms of Judaism. But the second presents much strangeness and novelty. It is the "worship of angels" in a "voluntary humility," inconsistent with the belief in an intimate and direct union with Christ our Head.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Let no man therefore judge you.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">impose his own laws upon you.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>.

Of such, St. Paul declares indignantly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>), "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."<p><span class= "bld">An holyday </span>(<span class= "ital">feast</span>)<span class= "ital">,<span class= "bld"> </span>or of the new moon, or of the sabbath.<span class= "ital"></span></span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-13.htm" title="Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.">Isaiah 1:13-14</a>, "the new moons and sabbaths . . . the new moons and the appointed feasts My soul hateth;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm" title="And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 45:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-13.htm" title="And I will visit on her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, said the LORD.">Hosea 2:13</a>. The "feast" would seem to be one of the great festivals; the "new moon" the monthly, and the sabbath the weekly solemnity. With this passage it is natural to compare the similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm" title="You observe days, and months, and times, and years.">Galatians 4:10</a>, "Ye observe days and months and times (<span class= "ital">special seasons</span>) and years." But there the specially Judaic character is not so expressly marked; and, in fact, the passage has a wider meaning (like Rom. 14:56), showing the different position which even Christian festivals held in Apostolic days. Here it is the Jewish festivals, and they alone, which are noted. It is obvious that St. Paul gives no hint of any succession of the Lord's Day to be, in any strict sense, a "Christian Sabbath." We know, indeed, that the Jewish Sabbath itself lingered in the Church, as having a kind of sacredness, kept sometimes as a fast, sometimes as a festival. But its observance was not of obligation. No man was to "judge" others in respect of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-23.</span> - SECTION VI. THE CLAIMS OF THE FALSE TEACHER. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do not let any one, therefore, be judging you in eating or in drinking</span> (vers. 21-23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-9.htm">Hebrews 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-19</a>). The new teachers dictated to the Colossians in these matters from the philosophical, ascetic point of view (see notes on "philosophy," "circumcision," vers. 8, 11), condemning their previous liberty. (For the adverse sense of "judge," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4, 10, 13</a>.) The scruples of the "weak brethren" at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>) were partly of an ascetic character, but are not ascribed to any philosophic views. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a> and 10 the question stands on a different footing, being connected with that of the recognition of idolatry (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a> it is purely a point of Jewish law. In one form or other it was sure to be raised wherever Jewish and Gentile Christians were in social intercourse. Ver. 17 shows that such restrictions are "not according to Christ" (ver. 8), belonging to the system which he has superseded. "Therefore" bases this warning upon the reasoning of the previous context. Tertullian ('Against Marcion,' 5:19) supplies the link connecting this verse with vers. 10, 15, 18, when he says, "The apostle blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats." The abolishing of angel mediation (ver. 15) robs these restrictions of their supposed authority. The Essenes found in the Nazarite life and the rules for the ministering Jewish priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-8.htm">Leviticus 10:8-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>) their ideal of holiness. Philo also attached a high moral value to abstinence from flesh and wine, and regarded the Levitical distinctions of meats as profoundly symbolic. Or in respect of feast, or new moon, or sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9, 10</a>). The yearly <span class="accented">feast</span>, the monthly <span class="accented">new moon</span>, and the weekly <span class="accented">sabbath</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13, 14</a>) cover the whole round of Jewish sacred seasons. These the Colossian Gentile Christians, disciples of St. Paul through Epaphras, had not hitherto observed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9, 10</a>). Philosophic Judaists insisted on these institutions, giving them a symbolical and ethical interpretation (see Philo, 'On the Number Seven;' also, 'On the Migration of Abraham,' &sect; 16, where he warns his readers lest, "because the feast is a symbol of the joy of the soul and of thanksgiving towards God," they should imagine they could dispense with it, or "break through any established customs which divine men have instituted"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
