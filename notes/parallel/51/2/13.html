The two passages should be read side by side. There is, as always, strong similarity, yet complete independence. Through the passage of the Ephesian Epistle there runs a two-fold idea, the reconcilement of Jew and Gentile to God, and the union of both in one Catholic Church. In this Epistle it is only on the reconcilement to God in Christ that stress is laid. Even the detailed expressions of the two passages illustrate each other at once by likeness and by variety.<p><span class= "bld">Dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>, "You who were dead in trespasses and sins . . . who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh." Here the "deadness" is spoken of, as coming both from the actual power of "sins" (<span class= "ital">transgressions</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and from the alienation from God marked by uncircumcision. In the other passage the uncircumcision is looked upon only as a name of reproach.<p><span class= "bld">Hath he quickened.</span>--It is difficult to determine what is the subject in this sentence. According to all analogy it should be "God," yet in the latter clauses (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14-15</a>) it must surely be "Christ." Now, when we turn to the fuller parallel passage, we see an overt change of subject. It is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>), "God quickened us together with Christ"; "God in Christ forgave us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>); but "Christ abolished the Law," "reconciled us to God on the cross." This suggests a similar change of subject here also, which must be at the words "and took it away," or (for the tense here is changed) "and He (Christ) hath taken it away." This, speaking grammatically, introduces an anomaly; but such anomalies are not uncommon in St. Paul, especially in passages of high spiritual teaching.<p><span class= "bld">Having forgiven you . . .</span>--There is no corresponding clause in the parallel passage; but in a different context (corresponding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm" title=" Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.">Colossians 3:13</a> of this Epistle) we read, "forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And you, being dead by reason of</span> (or, in) <span class="cmt_word">your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9-13, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1, 2, 6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>). (For the transition from "having raised" (ver. 12) to this verse, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20 - 2:1</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>.) Again the participle gives place to the finite verb: a colon is a sufficient stop at the end of ver. 12. <span class="accented">Death</span>, in St. Paul's theology, is "a collective expression for the entire judicial consequences of sin" (see Cromer's ' Lexicon,' on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3c2;</span>), of which the primary spiritual element is the sundering of the soul's fellowship with God, from which flew all other evils contained, in it. <span class="accented">Life</span>, therefore, begins with <span class="accented">justification</span>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18</a>). "Trespasses" are particular acts of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>); "uncircumcision of the flesh" is general sinful impurity of nature. The false teachers probably stigmatized the uncircumcised state as unholy. The apostle adopts the expression, but refers it to the pre-Christian life of his readers (see vers. 11, 12), when their Gentile uncircumcision was a true type of their moral condition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>). These sinful acts and this sinful condition were the cause of their former state of <span class="accented">death</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The Revisers rightly restore the second emphatic "you" - "you, uncircumcised Gentiles" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 22, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>). It is <span class="accented">God</span> who "made you alive" as he "raised him (Christ)," (ver. 12); the second act being the consequence and counterpart of the first, <span class="accented">and faith</span> the subjective link between them. <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">to show grace</span>, used of Divine forgiveness only in this and the Ephesian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-42.htm">Luke 7:42, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>), points to the cause or principle of forgiveness in the Divine <span class="accented">grace</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17</a>). In "having forgiven us" the writer significantly passes from the second to the first person: so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>). The thought of the new life bestowed on the Colossians with himself in their individual forgiveness calls to his mind the great act of Divine mercy from which it sprang (the connection corresponds, in reverse order, to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19, 20</a>), and he continues - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
