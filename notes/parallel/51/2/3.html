The word "hidden" (<span class= "ital">apocryphi</span>) is an almost technical word for secret teaching given only to the initiated; used originally as a term of honour (as the participle of the kindred verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1Corinthians 2:7-8</a>, "the wisdom of God in mystery, even the hidden wisdom . . . which none of the princes of this world knew"), afterwards, from the character of these "apocryphal" books, coming to signify spurious and heretical. St. Paul evidently takes up here a word, used by the pretenders to a special and abstruse knowledge, and applies it to the "heavenly things" which He alone knows "who is in heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12-13</a>). From our full comprehension they are hidden; if ever we know them, it will not be till "we know even as we are known." But the previous words show that we can have full practical apprehension of them by our knowledge of Christ, who knows them--a knowledge begun in faith, and perfected chiefly in love.<p><span class= "bld">Wisdom and knowledge.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a> ("the word of wisdom" . . . "the word of knowledge"). On the true sense of "wisdom" and its relation to other less perfect gifts, as "prudence," "intelligence," "knowledge," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a>. "Knowledge" is clearly the development of wisdom in spiritual perception, as "intelligence" in testing and harmonising such perception, and "prudence" in making them, so tested, the guide of life. The word "knowledge" (<span class= "ital">gnosis</span>) was the word which, certainly afterwards, probably even then, was the watchword of "Gnosticism"--the unbridled and fantastic spirit of metaphysical and religious speculation then beginning to infest all Christian thought. It can hardly be accidental that St. Paul here, as elsewhere, subordinates it to the higher gift of wisdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word"> In whom</span> (or, <span class="accented">which</span>) <span class="cmt_word">are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden(ly)</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm">Ephesians 1:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5, 6, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3</a>). Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and others make the relative pronoun neuter, referring to "mystery;" but "Christ," the nearer antecedent, is preferable (vers. 9, 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16, 17, 19</a>). <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">him</span> the apostle finds what false teachers sought elsewhere, a satisfaction for the intellect as well as for the heart - <span class="accented">treasures of wisdom and knowledge</span> to enrich the understanding, and unsearchable mysteries to exercise the speculative reason. "Hidden" is, therefore, a secondary predicate: in whom are these treasures, - as hidden treasures" (Ellicott, Lightfoot). (For a similar emphasis of position, compare "made complete," ver. 10, and "seated," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>.) Meyer and Alford, with the Vulgate, make "hidden" an attributive: "in whom are hidden treasures." Chrysostom and leading versions make it primary predicate: "in whom are hidden," etc., against the order of the words. This word also belongs to the dialect of the mystic theosophists (see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1-11</a>). (On "wisdom," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>.) <span class="accented">Knowledge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; for this phrase is more comprehensive) is the more objective and purely intellectual side of wisdom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.</body></html>
