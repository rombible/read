The prize here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.">1Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:14</a>) is the heavenly reward of the Christian course. In St. Paul's exhortation there seems to be a reference back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>. There he says, "Let no man arrogate judgment over you;" here, "Let no man use that arrogated judgment so as to cheat you of your prize. There is one Judge, who has right and who is righteous; look to Him alone."<p><span class= "bld">In a voluntary humility and worship.</span>--This rendering seems virtually correct, though other renderings are proposed. The original is, <span class= "ital">willing in humility and worship, </span>and the phrase "willing in" is often used in the LXX. for "delighting in." Other translations are here possible, though not without some harshness. But the true sense is shown beyond all doubt to be that given in our version, by the words used below to describe the same process, "will-worship and humility."<p>In this passage alone in the New Testament "humility "is spoken of with something of the condemnation accorded to it in heathen morality. The reason of this is obvious and instructive. Humility is a grace, of which the very essence is unconsciousness, and which, being itself negative, cannot live, except by resting on some more positive quality, such as faith or love. Whenever it is consciously cultivated and "delighted in, "it loses all its grace; it becomes either unreal, "the pride that apes humility," or it turns to abject slavishness and meanness. Of such depravations Church history is unhappily full.<p><span class= "bld">Worshipping of angels.</span>--This is closely connected with the "voluntary humility" above. The link of connection is supplied by the notice in the ancient interpreters, of the early growth of that unhappy idea, which has always lain at the root of saint-worship and angel-worship in the Church--"that we must be brought near by angels and not by Christ, for that were too high a thing for us" (Chrysostom). With this passage it is obvious to connect the emphasis laid (in Hebrews 1, 2) on the absolute superiority of our Lord to all angels, who are but "ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them who are heirs of salvation;" and the prohibition of angel-worship in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>, "See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant . . . worship God."<p>It might seem strange that on the rigid monotheism <span class= "ital">of</span> Judaism this incongruous creature-worship should have been engrafted. But here also the link is easily supplied. The worship of the angels of which the Essenic system bore traces, was excused on the ground that the Law had been given through the "ministration of angels" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>), and that the tutelary guardianship of angels had been revealed in the later prophecy. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-10.htm" title="And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.">Daniel 10:10-21</a>.) For this reason it was held that angels might be worshipped, probably with the same subtle distinctions between this and that kind of worship with which we are familiar in the ordinary pleas for the veneration of saints. It has been noticed that in the Council of Laodicea, held in the fourth century, several canons were passed against Judaising, and that in close connection with these it was forbidden "to leave the Church of God and go away to invoke angels"; and we are told by Theodoret (in the next century) that "oratories to St. Michael (the 'prince' of the Jewish people) were still to be seen." The "angels" in this half-Jewish system held the same intermediate position between the Divine and the human which in the ordinary Gnostic theories was held by the less personal <span class= "ital">'ons, </span>or supposed emanations from the Godhead.<p><span class= "bld">Intruding into those things which he hath not seen.</span>--(1) There is a remarkable division here, both of MSS. and ancient versions and commentators, as to the insertion or omission of the negative. But the balance of MS. authority is against the negative, and certainly it is easier to suppose it to have been inserted with a view to make an easier sense, than to have been omitted if it had been originally there. (2) The general meaning, however, of the passage is tolerably clear, and, curiously enough, little affected by either alternative. It certainly refers to pretensions to supernatural knowledge by which (just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>) the mind is said to be "puffed up." We note that, even in true visions of heavenly things, there was danger lest the mind "should be exalted above measure" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>). Now the knowledge here pretended to is that favourite knowledge, claimed by Jewish and Christian mystics, of the secrets of the heavenly places and especially of the grades and functions of the hierarchy of heaven. St. Paul brands it as belonging to the mind, not of the spirit, but "of the flesh;" for indeed it was really superstitions, resting not on faith, but on supposed visions and supernatural manifestations. It "intruded" (or, according to another rendering, it "took its stand") upon the secrets of a region which it said that it "had seen," but which, in truth, it "had not seen." If we omit the negative, the Apostle is quoting its claims; if we insert it, he is denying their justice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no one defraud you of your prize</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>).

The errorist condemns the Colossian Christian for his neglect of Jewish observances (ver. 16), and warns him that in his present state he will <span class="accented">miss the heavenly prize</span>, "the hope" he had supposed to be "in store for him in heaven" (ver. 5: comp. notes on Colossians 1:5 and Colossians 3:15; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delighting in lowliness of mind and worship of the angels</span> (ver. 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17, 18</a>). By these means the false teacher impressed his disciples. His angel worship commended itself as the mark of a devout and humble mind, reverent towards the unseen powers above us, and made purely <span class="accented">Christian</span> worship seem insufficient. "Delighting in" is the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> given by Bengel, Hofmann, Lightfoot, Klopper, and is preferable to that of Meyer and Ellicott, who, with several Greek interpreters, supply the sense of the previous verb "desiring (to do so) in lowliness etc.; and to that followed in the Revisers' margin,which puts a sort of adverbial sense on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - "of his mere will, by humility," etc. This latter rendering underlies the paraphrastic" voluntary humility" of the A.V., and agrees with the common interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23 (see note). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is, no doubt, a marked Hebraism, and St. Paul's language is "singularly free from Hebraisms" (compare, however, the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">to know</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; the similar <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is well established, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). This very idiom is frequently used in the LXX, and occurs in the 'Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,' a Christian writing, of the second century. The apostle may surely be allowed occasionally to have used a Hebraistic phrase, especially when so convenient and expressive as this. Westcott and Hort, with scrupulous purism, mark the reading on this account as doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> ("lowliness of mind"), a word, perhaps, compounded by St. Paul himself (see Trench's 'Synonyms'), is almost confined to the Epistles of this group (comp. ver. 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). This quality is ascribed <span class="accented">ironically</span> to the false teacher (compare the "puffed up" of the next clause, and for similar irony see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is "outward worship" or "devotion:" comp. note on ver. 23; elsewhere in New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26, 27</a> (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Worship of the angels" is that <span class="accented">paid to the angels</span>; not "offered by them," as Luther and Hofmann interpret, supposing that the errorists pretended to imitate the worship of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Investigating</span> (or, <span class="accented">dwelling on</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the things which he hath seen'! vainly - being puffed up by 'the reason' of his flesh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:l, 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>). For <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we adopt the sense which it bears in 2 Macc. 2:30; in Philo, 'On the Planting of Noah,' &sect; 19. and in patristic and later Greek generally, viz. "to search into," "examine," "discuss" (see Suicer's 'Thesaurus'). The rendering "proceeding" or "dwelling on," though near the radical sense of the word ("to step on" or "in"), wants lexical support. The same may be said of the rendering "intruding into," which suits the Received reading, "which he hath <span class="accented">not</span> seen." The "not" of the relative clause is wanting in nearly all our eldest and best witnesses, and is cancelled by the Revisers, with Tregelles, Tischendorf, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, etc. Its appearance in two different forms (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>) in the documents that present it, makes it still more certain that it is a copyist's insertion. The common reading gives, after all, an unsatisfactory sense; it is not likely the apostle would blame the errorist simply for entering into things beyond his sight (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Meyer, after Steiger and Huther, gives the best explanation of "which he hath seen," supposing the writer to allude ironically to <span class="accented">pretended visions</span> of angels or of the spiritual world, by which the false teacher sought to impose on the Colossians. This view is suggested by Tertullian in the passage cited under ver. 16. Such visions would be suitable for the purpose of the errorist, and congenial to the Phrygian temperament, with its tendency to mysticism and ecstasy (see Theodoret, quoted under ver. 15, who also says that <span class="accented">angel worship</span> was specially forbidden by the Council of Laodicea, A.n. 364). If the false teacher were accustomed to say with an imposing air, "I have seen, ah! I have seen!" in referring to his revelations, the apostle's allusion would be obvious and telling. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a> (R.V.) suggests a similar reliance on supernatural visions on the part of the apostle's earlier opponents. This pretentious visionary is, however, a "philosopher" and a "reasoner" first of all (vers. 4, 8). Accordingly he <span class="accented">investigates what he has seen</span>; inquires into the import of his visions, rationally develops their principles, and deduces their consequences. So far, the apostle continues in the ironical vein in which the first words of the verse are written, setting forth the pretensions of his opponent in his own terms, his irony "restraining itself till, after the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, the indignation of truth breaks forth from it" (Steiger) in the caustic and decisive "vainly." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span> qualifies the foregoing participle (so Origen, apparently, in Cramer's 'Catena,' vol. 4. p. 69; Steiger, De Wette, Hofmann, Conybeare) more suitably than the following. Thus it signifies "idly," "to no purpose," as everywhere else in St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>); not "without cause," as joined to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("puffed up"), whose 'force it could only weaken. "Vainly" stigmatizes the futility, "puffed up" the conceit, and "by the reason of his flesh" the low and sensuous origin of these vaunted revelations and of the high-flown theosophy which they were used to support. (For the sarcastic force of "puffed up," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). The "reason" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) is, in Greek philosophy, the philosophical faculty, the power of supersensible intuition; and in Plato and Philo, the organ of the higher, mystical knowledge of Divine things (see Philo, 'Who is Heir of Divine Things?' &sect;&sect; 13, 20, and <span class="accented">passim</span>). The Colossian "philosopher" (ver. 8) would, we may imagine, speak of himself as "borne aloft" in his visions "by heavenly reason," "lifted high in angelical communion," or the like. Hence the apostle's sarcasm, "Exalted are they? say rather, <span class="accented">inflated: lifted high by Divine reason?</span> nay, but <span class="accented">swollen high by the reason of their flesh."</span> Some such allusion to the language of the errorists best accounts for the paradoxical <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Lightfoot); contrast with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>, and compare the disparaging reference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">Colossians</span> 1:21 (note). Difficult as this passage is, we hesitate to follow Lightfoot, and Westcott and Herr, who have given their weighty sanction to the perilous remedy of <span class="accented">conjectural emendations</span>; the latter editors for the second Line in this verse, and again in ver. 23. The line of interpretation here adopted is advocated in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 11. pp. 385-398. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.</body></html>
