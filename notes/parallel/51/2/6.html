Such a <span class="accented">walk</span> will be consistent with their previous steadfastness, and will lead them to larger spiritual attainments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; see note). "Ye received" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>) reminds the Colossians of what they had received (compare" ye were taught," ver. 7 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>) rather than of the way of their receiving it. "Christ Jesus the Lord," is literally, <span class="accented">the Christ Jesus, the Lord</span> - an expression found besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a> (Revised Text). The prefixed article points out <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> in his full style and title as the Person whom the Colossians had received, and received as <span class="accented">the Lord.</span> "The Lord" has a predicative force, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> (R.V.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>. "Jesus is Lord" was the testing watchword applied in the discerning of spirits; "Jesus Christ is Lord" is to be the final confession of a reconciled universe; and "Christ Jesus is Lord" is the rule of faith that guides all conduct and tests all doctrine within the Church (comp. ver. 19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). It is "a summary of the whole Christian confession" (Meyer). To vindicate this lordship, on which the Colossian error trenched so seriously, is the main object of the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-20</a>). We must not, therefore, with Alford, Lightfoot, Hofmann, analyze "the Christ Jesus:" "Ye received the Christ, (namely) Jesus, who is the Lord." The writer has already used "Christ Jesus" as a single proper name at the outset (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1, 4</a>); and it was the <span class="accented">lordship of Christ Jesus, not the Messiahship of Jesus</span>, that was now in question. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5, 28</a> the situation is entirely different. In the following clause, "in him" is emphatic, as in ver. 7 (compare the predominant <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). Hence the contradiction of figure, "walk, rooted, and builded up," does not obtrude itself. (On "walk," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; and on "in Christ" in this connection, see notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.</body></html>
