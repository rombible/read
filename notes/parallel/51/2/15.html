Not, indeed, in the main idea. The cross, as usual, is identified with the triumph over the powers of evil which it won. The very phrase "made a show," is cognate to the words "put Him to open shame" applied to the Crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm" title="If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.">Hebrews 6:6</a>). The apparent triumph of the "power of darkness" over Him was His real and glorious triumph over them. The general idea is familiar to us, telling, as in the noble old hymn <span class= "ital">Vexilla Regis</span>--<p>"How of the Cross He made a throne<p>On which He reigns, a glorious king."<p>His forgiveness of the penitent thief was the first act of His all-saving royalty. Accordingly, taking (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2Corinthians 2:14-16</a>) his metaphor from a Roman triumph, St. Paul represents Him as passing in triumphal majesty up the sacred way to the eternal gates, with all the powers of evil bound as captives behind His chariot before the eyes of men and angels. It is to be noted that to this clause, so characteristic of the constant dwelling on the sole glory of Christ in this Epistle, there is nothing to correspond in the parallel passage of the Epistle to the Ephesians, which dwells simply on Christ as "our peace," and as the head of the Church.<p>The difficulty lies in the word here translated "having spoiled." Now this translation (as old as St. Jerome's Vulgate), makes all simple and easy; but the original word certainly means "having stripped Himself"--as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>, "having put off (<span class= "ital">stripped off from ourselves</span>) the old man." It is a word used by St. Paul alone in the New Testament, and by him only in these two passages, the latter of which makes the sense perfectly clear. Being forced, then, to adopt this translation, we see that the words admit of two renderings. (1) First, "having stripped from Himself the principalities and powers," that is, having stripped off that condition of the earthly life which gave them a grasp or occasion against Him. But this, though adopted by many old Greek commentators (Chrysostom among the rest), seems singularly harsh in expression and far-fetched in idea, needing too much explanation to make it in any sense clear. (2) Next, "having unclothed Himself, He made a show of principalities and powers." On the whole this rendering, although not free from difficulty, on account of the apparent want of connection of the phrase "having stripped Himself" with the context, seems the easiest. For we note that a cognate word, strictly analogous, is used thus (without an object following) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2Corinthians 5:4</a>, "Not that we desire to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves over our earthly vesture." The context shows that the meaning there is "to put off the flesh." This is suggested still more naturally in the passage before us by the preceding phrase, "in the putting off of the body of the flesh"--a phrase there used of the flesh as evil, but found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a> of the natural body of Christ. Accordingly many Latin fathers (among others Augustine) rendered "stripping Himself of the flesh," and there is some trace of this as a reading or a gloss in the Greek of this passage. Perhaps, however, St. Paul purposely omitted the object after the verb, in order to show that it was by "stripping Himself of all" that He conquered by becoming a show in absolute humiliation, He made the powers of evil a show in His triumph.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having stripped off the principalities and the dominions</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38, 53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5, 7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has been rendered, from the time of the Latin Vulgate, "having spoiled" (<span class="accented">exspolians</span>), a rendering which is "not less a violation of St. Paul's usage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>) than of grammatical rule" (Lightfoot; so Alford, Ellicott, Wordsworth, Hofmann, Revisers). It is precisely the same participle that we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>, and the writer has just used the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 11) in a corresponding sense (see note <span class="accented">in loc.</span> on the force of the double compound). He employs compounds of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> in the middle voice seventeen times elsewhere, and always in the sense of "putting off [or, 'on'] from one's self;" and there is no sure instance in Greek of the middle verb bearing any other meaning. Yet such critics as Meyer, Eadie, Klopper, cling to the rendering of the Vulgate and our Authorized Version; and not without reason, as we shall see. The Revised margin follows the earlier Latin Fathers and some ancient versions, supplying "his body" as object of the participle, understanding "Christ" as subject. But the context does not, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>, suggest this ellipsis, and it is arbitrary to make the participle itself mean "having disembodied <span class="accented">himself."</span> Nor has the writer introduced any new subject since ver. 12, where" God" appears as agent of each of the acts of salvation set forth in vers. 12-15. Moreover, "the principalities and the dominions" of this verse must surely be those of ver. 10 and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> (compare the "angels" of ver. 18). We understand St. Patti, therefore, to say "that God [revealing himself in Christ; 'in him,' 15 b] put off and put away those angelic powers through whom he had previously shown himself to men." The Old Testament associates the angels with the creation of the world and the action of the powers of nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; Psalm cir. 4), and with its great theophanies generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, etc.); and its hints in this direction were emphasized and extended by the Greek translators of the LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38, 53</a> (St. Stephen); <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, ascribe to them a special agency in <span class="accented">the giving of the Law.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>. and it. show how large a place the doctrine of the mediation of angels filled in Jewish thought at this time, and how it tended to limit the mediatorship of Christ. The mystic developments of Judaism among the Essenes and the Ebionites (Christian Essenes), and in the Cabbala, are full of this belief. And it is a cornerstone of the philosophic mysticism of Alexandria. In Philo the angels are the "Divine <span class="accented">powers," "words," "images</span> of <span class="accented">God,"</span> forming the court and <span class="accented">entourage</span> of the invisible King, by whose means he created and maintains the material world, and holds converse with the souls of men (see quotation, ver. 10). This doctrine, we may suppose, was a chief article of the Colossian heresy. Theodoret's note on ver. 18 is apposite here: "They who defended the Law taught men to worship angels, saying that the Law was given by them. This mischief continued long in Phrygia and Pisidia." The apostle returns to the point from which he started in ver. 10. He has just declared that God has cancelled and removed the Law as an instrument of condemnation; and now adds that he has at the same time thrown off and laid aside the veil of angelic mediation under which, in the administration of that Law, he had withdrawn himself. Both these acts take place "in Christ." Both are necessary to that "access to the Father" which, in the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> view, is the special prerogative of Christian faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>), and which the Colossian error doubly barred, by its ascetic ceremonialism and by its angelic mediation. (See, on this passage, Alford; also Peirce's 'Paraphrase and Notes,' 2nd edit., 1729; Robertson Smith, on 'Christ and the Angels,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, second series, vol. 1:138, etc.; A. Sabatier's 'L'Apotre Paul,' p. 220, 2nd edit., 1881.) We are compelled, with all deference to its high authority, to reject the view of the Greek Fathers, to which Ellicott, Lightfoot, and Wordsworth have returned, according to which "Christ in his atoning death [in it; 'the cross,' ver. 15 b] stripped off from himself the Satanic powers." For it requires us to bring in, without grammatical warrant, <span class="accented">"somewhere"</span> (Lightfoot), "Christ" as subject; it puts upon" the principalities and the dominions" a sense foreign to the context, and that cannot be justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the connection is wholly different and the hostile sense of the terms is most explicitly defined; and it presents an idea harsh and unfitting in itself, the incongruity of which such illustrations as those of the <span class="accented">Nessus robe</span> and <span class="accented">Joseph's garment</span> only make more apparent. It is one thing to say that the powers of evil <span class="accented">surrounded</span> Christ and quite another thing to say that he <span class="accented">wore</span> them as we have worn "the body of the flesh" (ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>). He made a show (of them) openly, having led them in triumph in him; or, <span class="accented">it</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1.htm">John 1</a>:52; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). In this, as in the last verse, we have a finite verb between two participles, one introductory ("having stripped off"), the other explanatory, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to <span class="accented">make a show</span> or <span class="accented">example</span>, occurs in the New Testament besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm">Matthew 1:17</a>, where it is compounded with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> (Revised Text), giving it a sinister meaning of not belonging to the simple verb. With the angelic <span class="accented">"principalities,"</span> etc., for object, the verb denotes, not a shameful exposure, but "an exhibition of them in their true character and position," such as forbids them to be regarded superstitiously (ver. 18). God exhibited the angels as the subordinates and servants of his Son (ver. 10: camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>, etc.). "Openly" ( <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">in freedom of speech</span>, a favourite word of St. Paul s) implies the absence of reserve or restraint, rather than mere publicity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("having triumphed;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a> only other instance of the verb in the New Testament; its use in classical Greek confined to Latinist writers, referring, historically, to the Roman <span class="accented">triumph</span>) presents a formidable difficulty in the way of the interpretation of the verse followed so far. For the common acceptation of the word "triumph" compels us to think of the "principalities," etc., as <span class="accented">hostile</span> (<span class="accented">Satanic</span>); and this, again, as Meyer strongly contends, dictates the rendering "having spoiled" for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. So we are brought into collision with two fixed points of our former exegesis. If we are bound lexically to abide by the reference to the Roman military triumph, then the angelic principalities must be supposed to have stood in a quasi-hostile position to "the kingdom of God and of Christ," <span class="accented">in so far as men had exaggerated their powers and exalted them at Christ's expense</span>, and to have been now robbed of this false pre-eminence. The writer however, ventures to question whether, on philological grounds, a better, native Greek sense cannot be found for this verb. The noun <span class="accented">thriambos</span> ("triumph"), on which it is based, is used, indeed, in the Latin sense as early as Polybius, a writer on Roman history (). But it is extant in a much earlier classical fragment as synonymous with <span class="accented">dithyrambos</span>, denoting "a festal song;" and again in Plutarch, contemporary with St. Paul, it is a name of the Greek god Dionysus, in whose honour such songs were sung, and whose worship was of a choral, processional character. This kinder <span class="accented">triumph</span> was, one may imagine, familiar to the eyes of St. Paul and of his readers, while the spectacle of the Roman triumph was distant and foreign (at least when he wrote 2 Corinthians). We suggest that the apostle's image is taken, beth here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, from <span class="accented">the festal procession</span> of the Greek divinity, who leads his worshippers along as witnesses of his power and celebrants of his glory. Such a figure fittingly describes the relation and the attitude of the angels to the Divine presence in Christ. Let this suggestion, however, be regarded as precarious or fanciful, the general exposition of the verse is not thereby invalidated. (For further elucidation, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 403-421; 11. p. 78. On "triumph," in 2 Corinthians, see Mr. Waite's <span class="accented">Additional note</span> in 'Speaker's Commentary.') The Revisers omit the marginal "in himself" of the Authorized Version, which correctly, as we think, refers the final <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> to <span class="accented">Christ</span> (ver. 10), though incorrectly implying "Christ" as subject of the verse. It was not only "in the cross" that God unveiled himself, dispensing with angelic theophanies, but in the entire person and work of his Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). "Which veil" (for here we may apply the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>) "is done away in Christ." So the whole passage (vers. 10-15) ends, as it begins, "in him:" "We are complete in him" - in our conversion from sin to holiness set forth in baptism, and our resurrection from death to life experienced in forgiveness (vers. 11-13); and in the removal at once of the legal bar which forbade our access to God (ver. 14), and of the veil of inferior and partial mediation which obscured his manifestation to us (ver. 15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
