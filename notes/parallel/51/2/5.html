From chrio; Anointed One, i.e. The Messiah, an epithet of Jesus.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Absent in the flesh.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1Corinthians 5:3</a>, "I as absent in body and present in spirit."<p><span class= "bld">Your order, and the stedfastness.</span>--The word "order" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-40.htm" title="Let all things be done decently and in order.">1Corinthians 14:40</a>; the word "stedfastness," or <span class= "ital">solidity, </span>is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, though the verb from which it is derived is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm" title="And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.">Acts 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-5.htm" title="And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.">Acts 16:5</a>, and the original adjective, from which the verb is derived, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm" title="Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.">1Peter 5:9</a>, "stedfast in the faith." From the days of the ancient Greek interpreters downwards, it has been noted that both words have military associations--the one being used for discipline generally, and the other for the firm compact solidity of the phalanx; and (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11-17</a>) that the use of them may have been suggested by St. Paul's captivity under military guard. If both words be referred to their "faith," the Apostle obviously characterises it as having right "order" (or, <span class= "ital">harmony</span>) in its various parts, and a strong "solidity" against all trials.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if indeed I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>). The connection of this verse with the last is not obvious. Ellicott, following Chrysostom, makes St. Paul's spiritual presence the reason for his being able to give the Colossians this warning; Meyer, his bodily absence the reason for their needing it. It is better, with Lightfoot, to see here a general explanatory reference to the previous context, a renewed declaration (ver. 1) of watchful interest in these distant brethren and a hearty acknowledgment of their Christian loyalty. The tone of authoritative warning just assumed (ver. 4) is thus justified, and yet softened (compare the apologetic tone of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14, 15</a>). The phrase, "if I am absent," does not imply a previous <span class="accented">presence</span> (see note, ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4-8, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). St. Paul dos not say, "rejoicing in beholding." The consciousness of union with brethren far away, whom he has never seen (ver. 1), is itself a joy; and this joy is heightened by what he sees through the eyes of Epaphras (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 6-8</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>) of the condition of this Church. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are military terms, denoting the "ordered array" and "solid front" of an army prepared for battle (Lightfoot, Hofmann): comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>. Others find the figure of a <span class="accented">building</span> underlying the second word - Vulgate, <span class="accented">firmamentum</span> ("solid basis") - and this is its more usual meaning, and agrees with ver. 7 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, LXX, for the <span class="accented">noun</span>, not found, elsewhere in the New Testament). The precise expression, "faith in Christ" (literally, <span class="accented">into -</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>, see note) occurs only here in the New Testament; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a> read "in Christ Jesus." In such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22, 26</a> (where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is followed by the genitive), Christ appears as <span class="accented">object</span> of faith; in such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a> and Colossians 2:5 he is its <span class="accented">ground</span> or <span class="accented">substratum</span>, that <span class="accented">in</span> which it rests and dwells, <span class="accented">into</span> which it roots itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.</body></html>
