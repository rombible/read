In the former clause both are identical. In the latter clause this Epistle is stronger. What in the earlier Epistle is the "likeness of His Resurrection" is here the participation of it, "Ye are risen with Him." Similarly, instead of the simple allusion to "Christ's being raised from the dead," we have here "through faith in the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead." Here, as in the more detailed passage of the Ephesian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5-7</a>), the "operation," the energy of "the mighty power of God," is conceived as actually working both in the Head and in the Body, so that wo through it partake of the resurrection, the ascension, and the glorified majesty of Christ. The comparison shows an instructive development in this Epistle of the consequences of the unity with Christ.<p>This passage is also notable for the obvious contrast of baptism, as a spiritual reality, with circumcision as a symbolic form. Each is the entrance into a covenant with God; but the one into a covenant of "the letter," and the other into a covenant of "the spirit." (See the contrast between the covenants drawn out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>.) In the earlier Epistles circumcision is contrasted with spiritual regeneration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>), as shown by various signs, such as "faith working by love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), or "keeping the commandments of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>). Here this contrast is still as strong as ever; but baptism being (as always) looked upon as the means of such spiritual regeneration, is brought out emphatically as "the circumcision of the Spirit." As baptised into Christ, "we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Philippians 3:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - When ye were (literally, <span class="accented">having been</span>) buried with him in your baptism (ver. 20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the rarer form of the word, is preferred by Tregelles, Alford, Lightfoot (see his note), being found in Codex B, with other good authorities; it indicates the process ("in your baptizing"). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the usual form of the word, is retained by Revisers, after Tischendorf, Ellicott, Westcott and Herr. <span class="accented">Baptism</span> stands for the entire change of the man which it symbolizes and seals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>). The double aspect of this change was indicated by the twofold movement taking place in immersion, the usual form of primitive baptism - first the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the descent of the baptized person beneath the symbolic waters, figuring his death with Christ as a separation from sin and the evil past (ver. 20), - there for a moment he is <span class="accented">buried</span>, and burial is death made complete and final (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2-4</a>); then the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the emerging from the baptismal wave, which gave baptism the positive side of its significance. In which (or, <span class="accented">whom</span>) also ye were raised with (him), through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>). We refer the relative pronoun to the immediately antecedent "baptism," although the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span> refers to "Christ" (ver. 11: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>) and some good interpreters follow the rendering "in whom." For the Christian's <span class="accented">being raised with Christ</span> is not contrasted with his <span class="accented">circumcision</span> (ver. 11) - that figure has been dismissed - but with <span class="accented">his burial in baptism</span> (ver. 12 a); so Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Revisers. "Having been buried" is replaced in the antithesis by the more assertive "ye were raised" (comp. vers. 13, 14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 26</a>). "With" points to the "him" (Christ) of the previous clause (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). <span class="accented">Faith</span> is the instrumental cause of that which baptism sets forth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>), and has for its object (not its cause: so Bengel) "the working" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>) "of God." And the special Divine work on which it rests is "the resurrection of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13-17</a>): comp. note on "Firstborn out of the dead," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>. Rising from the baptismal waters, the Christian convert declares the faith of his heart in that supreme act of God, which attests and makes sure all that he has bestowed upon us in his Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12-14</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33, 38</a>, etc.). Baptism symbolizes all that circumcision did, and more. It expresses more fully than the older sacrament our parting with the life of sin; and also that of which circumcision knew nothing - the union of the man with the dying and risen Christ, which makes him "dead unto sin, and alive unto God." How needless, then, even if it were legitimate, for a Christian to return to this superseded rite! To heighten his readers' sense of the reality and completeness of the change which as baptized (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">believing</span>) Christians they bad undergone, he describes it now more directly as matter of personal experience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
