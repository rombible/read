All these speculations and superstitions interfered with the direct hold of the soul on the mediation of Christ, as the Head, from whom alone, as being "the image of the invisible God," come all spiritual life and growth. Therefore they had a practical and spiritual importance.<p><span class= "bld">From which all the body . . .</span>--Comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>, and see Note there. The agreement is nearly verbal, but the characteristic difference of idea, so often noted, is still traceable. There the body "maketh increase unto the building up of itself in love;" here the increase is simply "the increase of God"--the increase which God gives, and which grows into His likeness. In this passage there is also a greater scientific exactness: the "joints and bands" are the "articulations and ligaments;" the two functions thereof are the diffusion of nourishment and the knitting together of organic unity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not holding fast the Head</span> (vers. 6, 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). In the last verse the errorist was judged "out of his own mouth," and the intrinsic hollowness of his pretensions was exposed. Now" he appears before the judgment seat of Christ," charged with high treason against him, the Lord alike of the kingdoms of nature and of grace. So the apostle falls back once more (comp. ver. 10) on the foundation laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, on which his whole polemic rests. Both in creation and redemption, the philosophic Judaists assigned to the angels a <span class="accented">role</span> inconsistent with the sovereign mediatorship of Christ (see notes on vers. 10 and 15). <span class="cmt_word">From whom all the body, through its joinings and bands being supplied and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). Disloyalty to "the head" works destruction to "the body," which in this case "proceeds from" ("grows out of," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>,) its Head, while it depends upon him. Gnosticism from the beginning tended to disintegrate the Church, by the caste feeling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>, note; Colossians 3:11) and the sectarian spirit to which it gave birth (ver. 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). Its vague and subjective doctrines were ready to assume a different form with each new exponent, Here lies the connection between this and the Ephesian letter, the doctrine of the Church following upon and growing out of that of the person of Christ, each being threatened - the latter immediately, the former more remotely - by the rise of the new Judaeo-Christian mystic rationalism. Colossians asserts the "thou in me" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a>; Ephesians the corresponding "I in them;" and both the consequent "they made perfect in one" (comp., especially, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a> and Ephesians 4:7-16 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a> and Colossians 2:9-15). (On "body," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> signifies, not "joints "as parts of the bony skeleton, but includes all points of contact and connection in the body; Latin <span class="accented">nexus, junetura</span> (see Lightfoot). Bengel and Meyer, following Chrysostom, interpret it as "senses," or "nerves;" but this does not commend itself either lexically or contextually. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a>) are the "ligaments," the stronger and more distinct connections that give the bodily framework unity and solidity. So, by the organic cooperation of the whole structure, the body of Christ is <span class="accented">furnished with its supplies</span>, enabled to receive and dispense to each member the needed sustenance; and "knit together" (ver. 2), drawn into a close and firm unity. "Supplied" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>) indicates a sustenance both required and due. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a> we read of <span class="accented">the increase of the gospel</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a> of <span class="accented">the individual believer</span>, and now of <span class="accented">the Church as a body</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>). "The increase of God" is that which God bestows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>), as it proceeds "from Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: ver. 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>), in whom is "the fulness of the Godhead" (ver. 9: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a> and Ephesians 3:17 - 19). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> the same idea is expressed in almost the same terms. There, however, the growth appears as proper to the body, resulting from its very constitution; here, as a bestowment of God, dependent, therefore, upon Christ, and ceasing if the Church ceases to <span class="accented">hold fast</span> to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.</body></html>
