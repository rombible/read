The reason of that anxiety is found in the "beguiling and enticing words" of an incipient Gnosticism. But "though absent in the body" he rejoices in the steadfastness of their faith, and only exhorts them to continue in it, deepening and enlarging it, but never changing its essence.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">What great conflict.</span>--The word is here repeated from the "striving" of the previous verse, which is, in the original, the cognate verb. It is the same word which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Philippians 1:30</a> ("conflict"), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1Thessalonians 2:2</a> ("contention"), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1Timothy 6:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a> ("the good fight of faith"). Evidently it describes the intense earnestness of the whole struggle against evil which he was undergoing for them; but perhaps, looking at <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a>, we may refer it especially to "striving in prayer" for them. It is probably dwelt upon here to show why, although unknown to them personally, he yet writes so urgently to them.<p><span class= "bld">And for them at Laodicea.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm" title=" For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.">Colossians 4:13</a>, "For you, and for them that are in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis." These three cities lay near together in the valley of Lycus, a tributary of the Maeander; probably they were converted at one time, and are evidently regarded as forming one Christian community, for which Epaphras, the evangelist of Colossae, felt himself responsible. Colossae and Laodicea are actually directed to exchange the apostolic Letters sent to them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-16.htm" title=" And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.">Colossians 4:16</a>, and Note there), and to read both alike in the churches. (See Dr. Lightfoot's admirable description of "The Churches of the Lycus," prefixed to his commentary on this Epistle.) Of Laodicea, the greatest and richest of the three cities, we have no further notice in Scripture, except that stern apocalyptic letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14-22</a>), which has made its name proverbial for spiritual luke-warmness and presumptuous self-reliance. It has been noticed that in this Letter our Lord is called "the beginning of the creation of God." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-18</a> of this Epistle.) Of Colossae and Hierapolis we read only in this Epistle. It is notable (see Dr. Lightfoot's Essay) that while Hierapolis and Laodicea play a prominent part in the subsequent history of Christianity in Asia Minor, Colossae never attains importance, and has left but "few and meagre" remains, compared with the magnificent ruins of the other cities.<p><span class= "bld">As many as have not seen my face.</span>--This description doubtless indicates Hierapolis; but the whole context shows that it also includes Colossae. If the reading taken in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a> is correct, Epaphras had been commissioned by St. Paul, and thus, indirectly, the Apostle might be held to be the founder of Colossae. Accordingly this Letter stands, so to speak, midway between the unreserved familiarity of the Epistles to Corinth or Philippi, and the more formal reserve of the Epistle to the Romans.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - SECTION IV. THE APOSTLE'S CONCERN FOR THE COLOSSI. AN CHURCH. So far the contents of the letter have been of a general and preparatory character. New the writer begins to indicate the special purpose he has in view by declaring, in connection with his concern for the welfare of the Gentile Churches at large (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24-29</a>), <span class="accented">the deep anxiety which he at present feels respecting the Colossian and neighbouring Churches.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I would have you know how great a strife I have on behalf of you and those in Laodicea</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8, 25-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-20.htm">Galatians 4:20</a>). The apostle has dwelt at such length and so earnestly upon his own position and responsibilities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24-29</a>), that the Colossians may feel how real and strong is his interest in their welfare, though personally strangers to him (see next clause). His solicitude for them is in keeping with the toil and strife of his whole ministry. "I would have you know;" a familiar Pauline phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>, etc.). <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("how great') has, perhaps, a slightly exclamatory force, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5</a> (only other instance of the word in the New Testament), and in classical Greek. For "strife," see note on "striving" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>): the energy and abruptness of language characterizing this second chapter bear witness in the inward wrestling which the Colossian difficulty occasioned in the apostle's mind. (On the close connection of Colossae with Laodicea, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13-17</a>, notes; also Introduction, &sect; 1.) The danger which had come to a head in Colassae was doubtless threatening its neighbours. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and as many as have not seen my face in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (ver. 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>), raise the question whether St. Paul had ever visited Colossae. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see note) raises a strong presumption against his being the founder of this Church, and the narrative of the Acts scarcely admits of any visit to this region in former missionary journeys. Theodoret amongst the Greeks, followed by our own Lardner and a few recent critics, contended that the apostle distinguishes here between Colossians and Laodiceans (or at least the former), and <span class="accented">those who had not seen His face.</span> But the disjunction is grammatically harsh and improbable (see Ellicott). (On the general question, see Introduction, &sect; 2.) The apostle is the more anxious for this endangered Church, as the gifts that his presence might have conveyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>) were wanting to them. He says, "in flesh," for "in spirit" he is closely united with them (ver. 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>). The object of his <span class="accented">strife on their behalf</span> is - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.</body></html>
