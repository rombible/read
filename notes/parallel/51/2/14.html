What this bond is we see by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, which speaks of "the law of commandments in ordinances," there called "the enmity slain by the cross." On the meaning of "ordinances" see Note on that passage. The metaphor, however, here is different, and especially notable as the first anticipation of those many metaphors of later theology, from Tertullian downwards, in which the idea of a debt to God, paid for us by the blood of Christ, as "a satisfaction," is brought out. The Law is a bond, "Do this and thou shalt live." "The soul that sinneth it shall die." On failure to do our part it "stands against us." But God for Christ's sake forgives our transgressions and cancels the bond. It is a striking metaphor, full of graphic expressiveness; it is misleading only when (as in some later theologies) we hold it to be not only the truth, but the whole truth, forgetting that legal and forensic metaphors can but imperfectly represent inner spiritual realities.<p><span class= "bld">And took it.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">and He</span> (Christ) <span class= "ital">hath taken it away.</span> The change of tense is significant. The act of atonement is over; its effect remains.<p><span class= "bld">Nailing it to his cross.</span>--At this point the idea of atonement comes in. Hitherto we have heard simply of free forgiveness and love of God. Now the bond is viewed, not as cancelled by a simple act of divine mercy, but as absolutely destroyed by Christ, by "nailing it to His cross." It has been supposed (as by Bishop Pearson) that there is allusion to some custom of cancelling documents by the striking of a nail through them. But the custom is doubtful, and the supposition unnecessary. Our Lord "redeemed us from the curse of the Law," by His death, "being made a curse for us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>). St. Paul boldly speaks of that curse as a penalty standing against us, and as nailed to the cross with Himself, so to be for ever cancelled in the great declaration, "It is finished." If any more definite allusion is to be sought for, we might be inclined to refer to the "title" on the cross, probably nailed to it. Such title declared the explanation of the sufferer's death. The cancelled curse of the Law was just such an explanation of the great atoning death, and the title, declaring His mediatorial kingdom, showed the curse cancelled thereby.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having blotted out the bond</span> (that was) <span class="cmt_word">against us with</span> (or, <span class="accented">written in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>decrees, which was opposed to us</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38, 39</a>).

"God," not "Christ," is the subject of this verb, which stands in immediate sequence to those of vers. 12, 13 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). It is <span class="accented">the receiver</span> rather than <span class="accented">the offerer</span> of satisfaction who cancels the debt: in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>) a different verb is used. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("handwritten;" a word of later Greek, only here in the New Testament) is used specially <span class="accented">of an account of debt, a bond signed by the debtor's hand</span> (see Meyer and Lightfoot). This <span class="accented">bond</span> (with its <span class="accented">decrees</span>) can be nothing other than "the law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21, 22</a>, etc.); not, however, <span class="accented">the ritual law</span>, nor even <span class="accented">the Mosaic Law</span> as such (as Meyer contends), but <span class="accented">law as law</span>, the Divine rule of human life impressed even on Gentile hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14, 15</a>), to which man's conscience gives its consent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-16.htm">Romans 7:16, 22</a>), and yet which becomes by his disobedience just a list of charges against him (so Neander and Lightfoot; see the latter on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14-26</a>, indeed, illustrate this wider relation of Divine law to the human conscience generally. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is dative of reference either to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> ("against us:" qualifying or explanatory - <span class="accented">in respect of its decrees</span>) or to the verbal idea contained in <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("written in," or "with decrees"). The former explanation (that of Winer and Ellicott) is preferable. The Greek Fathers made it instrumental dative to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, understanding by these <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;</span> (<span class="accented">dogmas</span>) <span class="accented">of the gospel by which the charges of the Law against us are expunged.</span> But this puts on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> a later theological sense foreign to St. Paul, and universally rejected by modern interpreters. In the New Testament (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a>), as in classical Greek, <span class="accented">dogma</span> is <span class="accented">a decree</span>, setting forth the will of some public authority (comp. note on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, ver. 20). The added clause, "which was opposed to us," affirms the active opposition, as "against us" the essential hostility of the decrees of God's law to our sinful nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13, 14</a>). The emphasis with which St. Paul dwells on this point is characteristic of the author of Romans and Galatians. <span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>; the prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> implies close and persistent opposition (Lightfoot). <span class="cmt_word">And he hath taken it out of the midst, having nailed it to the cross</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). A third time in these three verses (12-14) we note the transition from participle to coordinate finite verb; and here, in addition, the aorist tense passes into the perfect ("hath taken"), marking the finality of the removal of the Law's condemning power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>): comp. the opposite transition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>. The <span class="accented">moral deliverance</span> of ver. 11 is traced up to this <span class="accented">legal release</span>, both contained in our completeness in Christ (ver. 10). The subject is still "God." <span class="accented">Cancelling the bond</span> which he held against us in his Law, God has forver <span class="accented">removed the barrier</span> which stood between mankind and himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). <span class="accented">Christ's</span> place in this work, already shown in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18-23</a> (in its relation to <span class="accented">himself</span>), is vividly recalled by the mention of <span class="accented">the cross.</span> And the abolition of the Law's condemnation is finally set forth by a yet bolder metaphor - <span class="accented">"having nailed</span> it to the cross." The nails of the cross in piercing Christ pierced the legal instrument which held us debtors, and nullified it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4-6</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> may suggest the further idea of <span class="accented">nailing up</span> the cancelled document, by way of publication. At the cross all may read, "There is now no condemnation" (compare the "making a show" of ver. 15; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>). (For vers. 11-14, compare concluding remark on Colossians 1:14.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
