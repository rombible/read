"The Law had a shadow of good things to come, not the very image (or, <span class= "ital">substance</span>) of the things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>). When St. Paul deals with the legal and coercive aspect of the Law, he calls it "the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>, and Note there.) When he turns to its ritual aspect, he describes it as simply foreshadowing or typifying the substance; and therefore useful before the revelation of the substance, useless or (if trusted in) worse than useless, after it. In every way "Christ is the end of the Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>). The apostle's opponents, we imagine, taught in Platonic fashion that these things were shadows of <span class="accented">ideal truth</span> and of <span class="accented">the invisible world</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>), forms necessary to our apprehension of spiritual things. With St. Paul, they shadow forth prophetically <span class="accented">the concrete facts of the Christian revelation</span>, and therefore are displaced by its advent. The singular verb (literally, <span class="accented">is</span>) quite grammatically combines the particulars of ver. 16 under their common idea of a foreshadowing of the things of Christ; and the present tense affirms here a general truth, not a mere historical fact. How this was true of the "sabbath," e.g., appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>, for the Christian import of the Passover feast. The figurative antithesis of "shadow" and "body" is sufficiently obvious; it occurs in Philo and in Josephus: to refer to ver. 19 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> for the sense of <span class="accented">body</span>, is misleading. For "the things to come" (the things of Christ and of the new, Christian era, now commencing), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>. This substance of the new, abiding revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11</a>) is "Christ's," inasmuch as it centres in and is pervaded and governed by Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>). Nothing is said here to discountenance positive Christian institutions, or the observance of the Lord's day in particular, unless enforced in a Judaistic spirit. The apostle is protecting Gentile Christians from the re-imposition of Jewish institutions as such, as impairing their faith in Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-9</a>), and as, in the case of the Colossians, involving a deference to the authority of angels which limited his sovereignty and sufficiency (vers. 8-10, 18, 19). This verse contains in germ much of the thought of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
