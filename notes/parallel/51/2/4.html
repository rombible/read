Both words are used by St. Paul only in this passage. It would be difficult to describe more accurately the marvellous fabrics of Gnostic speculation, each step claiming to be based on some fancied probability or metaphysical propriety, but the whole as artificial as the cycles and epicycles of the old Ptolemaic astronomy. We know these in all the elaborate monstrosity of full growth; St. Paul doubtless saw them as yet only in embryo.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In this verse the apostle first definitely indicates the cause of his anxiety, and the Epistle begins to assume a polemic tone. This verse is, therefore, the prelude of the impending attack on the false teachers (vers. 8-23). <span class="cmt_word">This I say, that no one may be deluding you in persuasive speech</span> (vers. 8, 18, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). This was the danger which made a more adequate comprehension of Christianity so necessary to the Colossians (vers. 2, 3). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, one of the numerous <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span> of this Epistle (words only used here in the New Testament), compounds into one word the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> ("persuasive words") of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a> (compare "word of wisdom," ver. 23). In classical writers it denotes plausible, <span class="accented">ad captandum</span> reasoning. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> in the New Testament) is "to use bad logic," "to play off fallacies (paralogisms)." The new teachers were fluent, specious reasoners, and had a store of sophistical arguments at command. The tense of the verb indicates an apprehension as to what may be now <span class="accented">going on</span> (vers. 8, 16, 18, 20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>). We shall see afterwards (vers. 8-23) what was the doctrine underlying this "persuasive speech." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.</body></html>
