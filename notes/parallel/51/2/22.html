But the last word--which signifies, not only "using," but <span class= "ital">"</span>using up"--seems to decide for the latter alternative. The things are things which go to destruction and are used up. What permanent effect can they leave behind? See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm" title="But meat commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.">1Corinthians 8:8</a> (whether the words of St. Paul, or the words of the Corinthians, accepted as true by him), "Meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse." It is but an echo of our Lord's own teaching as to that which goeth into the mouth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-16.htm" title="And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding?">Matthew 15:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-18.htm" title="And pray you that your flight be not in the winter.">Mark 13:18-19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">After the commandments . . .</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>, and Note there. There seems to be an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>, quoted by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-7.htm" title="You hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,">Matthew 15:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-6.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Well has Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.">Mark 7:6-7</a>) in relation to these ceremonial observances.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22</span> <span class="accented">a</span> is the apostle's comment on these rules, in the form of a continuation of their terms. <span class="accented">Do not touch</span> - <span class="cmt_word">things which are an intended to perish</span> (literally, <span class="accented">for corruption</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in their consumption</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3-5</a>), which, being destroyed as they are used, therefore do not enter into the soul's life, and are of themselves morally indifferent; so the Greek Fathers, and most modern interpreters. This is the position which Christ himself takes in regard to Jewish distinctions of meats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-23</a>, R.V.). We note the same style of sarcastic comment on the language of the false teachers as that exhibited in ver. 18. Augustine, Calvin, and some ethers render, "which (decrees) tend to (spiritual) destruction in their use;" but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> never means simply "use," and the antecedent "decrees" is awkwardly supplied. More plausibly, De Wette and some moderns interpret, "things which tend to (spiritual) destruction in their abuse," putting the words in the mouth of the false teacher, as though he said, "Abstain from everything the use of which may be fatal to the soul." But this ascribes to the errorist an argument which fails short of his principles (see note on "hard treatment of the body," ver. 23); and to which, specious as it is, and in harmony with the apostle's own teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-12.htm">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26, 27</a>), he makes no reply. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandments and teachings of men</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, LXX; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-7.htm">Mark 7:7</a>; ver. 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-5.htm">1 Corinthians 2:5, 13</a>); the only passage in this Epistle which distinctly alludes to the language of the Old Testament. But the words are, we may suppose, primarily a reminiscence of the language of Christ, who uses them in connection with his announcement of the abolition of the sacred distinctions of meats (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>). This clause points out the method after which, and direction in which, the new teachers were leading their disciples, on the line of a man-made instead of a God given religion. "Commandments" (or, "injunctions") include the prescriptions of ver. 21 and all others like them; "teachings" embrace the general principles and doctrines on which these rules were based. So this expression, following "rudiments of the world (ver. 20), leads us back by a rapid generalization from the particulars specified in ver. 21 to the general starting point given in ver. 8 (see note), and prepares us for the brief and energetic summary of the whole Colossian error which we find in - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.</body></html>
