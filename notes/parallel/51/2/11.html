(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11</a>, "Ye who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh made with hands.") The phrase "made without hands" is so constantly used of heavenly realities (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>), as opposed to earthly symbols, that it comes to have the positive sense of "spiritual." It is defined below as "the circumcision of Christ"--that which Christ has given us in Himself--in contradistinction to the old circumcision which is now "nothing." (On the treatment of this subject in the Epistles of this period, comp. with this passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2-3</a>, and see Notes there.)<p><span class= "bld">In putting off the body . . .</span>--The words "of the sins" are not found in the best MSS. They are, no doubt, an explanatory gloss to soften the harshness of the phrase "the body of the flesh." (1) What "the body of the flesh" is we see clearly by <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>, "having put off the old man." It is, like the "body of sin" (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>) and the "body of death" (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24</a>), the body so far as it is, in the bad sense of the word "flesh," fleshly. The body itself is not "put off:" for it is not evil; it is a part of the true man, and becomes the temple of God. It is only so far as in it the flesh rebels against the spirit, and the "old man is gradually corrupted by the lusts of deceit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>), that it is to be "put off." (2) But why the "body of the flesh," and not the "flesh" simply? The answer is, no doubt, that which Chrysostom here gives, that the bodily circumcision was but of one member, in mere symbolism of one form of purity; the spiritual circumcision is the putting away of the whole of the power of the flesh, and that, too, not in symbol, but in reality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whom also ye were circumcised, with a circumcision not wrought by hands</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-9.htm">Romans 4:9-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-18.htm">1 Corinthians 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>:l, 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>). <span class="accented">Circumcision</span> was insisted on by the new "philosophical" teacher as necessary to spiritual <span class="accented">completeness</span>; but from a different standpoint, and in a manner different from that of the Pharisaic Judaizers of Galatia and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>. By the latter it was preached as <span class="accented">matter of Law and external requirement</span>, and so became the critical point in the decision between the opposing principles of "faith" and "works." By the philosophical school it was enjoined as <span class="accented">matter of symbolic moral efficiency.</span> So Philo speaks of circumcision ('On the Migration of Abraham,' &sect; 16) as "setting forth the excision of all the pleasures and passions, and the destruction of impious vain opinion" (see also his treatise 'On Circumcision'). From this point of view, <span class="accented">baptism</span> is the Christian circumcision, the new symbolic expression of the moral change which St. Paul and his opponents alike deemed necessary, though they understood it in a different sense from him (see vers. 20-23). In this respect the Christian is already <span class="accented">complete</span>, for his circumcision took place <span class="cmt_word">in the stripping off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5, 8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1, 2</a>). The inserted "of the sins" is an ancient gloss. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x28;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x28;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a double compound, found only in this Epistle (see corresponding verb in ver. 15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>), denotes both "stripping off" and "putting away." "The stripping off of the body" was the ideal of the philosophical ascetics (see note on "body," ver. 23, and quotations from Philo). The apostle adds "of the flesh;" <span class="accented">i.e. of the body in so far as it was the body of the flesh</span> (vers. Colossians 2:13, 18, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). "The flesh" (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> that which Christ had <span class="accented">put on</span>; here that which the Christian <span class="accented">puts off:</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>) is "the flesh of sin," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>, etc. "The body," while identified with this "flesh," is "the body of sin" and "of death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>; see Meyer, Godet, or Beet); sin inhabits it, clothes itself with it, and presents itself to us in its form; and this being the normal condition of unregenerate human nature, the sinful principle is naturally called <span class="accented">the flesh.</span> So "the (bodily) members" become "the members that are upon the earth," employed in the pursuit of lust and greed, till they become practically one with these vices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>, see note; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 23</a>). Yet "the body" and "the (sinful) flesh," while in the natural man one in practice, are in principle distinguishable (ver. 23: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>], and separable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a>). The deliverance from the physical acts and habits of the old sinful life, experienced by him who is "in Christ" (ver. 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>), is "the circumcision according to the Christ," or here more pointedly "of Christ" - a real and complete, instead of a partial and symbolic, putting away of the organic life and domination of sin which made the body its seat and its instrument. The genitive" of Christ <span class="accented">"is</span> neither objective ("undergone by Christ"), nor subjective ("wrought by Christ"), but stands in a mere general relation - "belonging to Christ," "the Christian circumcision." The occasion of this new birth in the Colossians was their <span class="accented">baptism -</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
