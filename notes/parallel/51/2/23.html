But in the words "neglecting of the body" (properly, being <span class= "ital">unsparing of it</span> in hardship, and generally careless of it) we pass to the ceremonial ordinances. It is more than likely that the superstition and false asceticism were connected together--the latter being the condition of the supposed spiritual insight of the former.<p><span class= "bld">Which things . . .</span> <span class= "bld">flesh.</span>--This passage is difficult. (1) Our version translates literally, and would seem to regard the last words as simply an explanation, from the point of view of the false teachers, of "neglecting of the body," as "not honouring it for the satisfaction, or surfeiting of the flesh;" and we certainly find that the Jewish ascetics did brand the most necessary satisfaction of appetite as a "surfeiting of the flesh." But there is a fatal objection to this interpretation--that, in that case, St. Paul would leave the false pretension without a word of contradiction, which is almost incredible. Hence (2) we must regard the "not in any honour" as antithetical to "the show of wisdom." The ordinances, says St. Paul, have "a show of wisdom," but "are in no honour," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>are "of no value." The common use of the word rendered "honour," for "price," or "pay" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm" title="And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.">Matthew 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1Timothy 5:17</a>), would readily lend itself to this sense. The only doubtful point (3) is the interpretation of the last words, "for the satisfying of the flesh." There seems little doubt that the phrase is used in a bad sense. Hence we must dismiss all reference to a right honouring of the body by innocent satisfaction of its needs. We have therefore to choose between two interpretations. Some interpret "of no value <span class= "ital">against</span> the satisfaction of the flesh." But, though the Greek will bear this sense, it is certainly not the common sense of the preposition used; and its adoption would expose the whole phrase to the charge of ambiguity and obscurity. The other interpretation is "of no real value" (tending) "to the satisfaction of the flesh." This is abrupt, but suits well the indignant and abrupt terseness of the passage. It gives (quite after St. Paul's manner) not only a denial of the "neglecting of the body," but a retort on the false teachers of the very charge they made against their opponents. (Comp. the use of the word "dogs," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>.) It conveys a most important truth. That "extremes meet" we know well; and that there is a satisfaction of the fleshly temper (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>) in the attempt over much to curb the flesh, the whole history of asceticism bears witness. Moreover, this interpretation alone gives a completeness of antithesis. To "the show of wisdom" it opposes the "no real value;" to the pretended "neglecting of the body" the real" satisfaction of the flesh."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Such as have</span> (literally, <span class="accented">are</span> (<span class="accented">things</span>) <span class="accented">having</span>) <span class="cmt_word">word indeed of wisdom</span> (vers. 4, 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>). The antecedent of "such as" is "command merits and teachings" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott), not "decrees" (ver. 21). For ver. 22 supplies the immediate antecedent, and the wider sense thus given is necessary to support the comprehensive and summary import of ver. 23. The Greek "are having" brings into view the nature and qualities of the subject, in accordance with <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">such as</span>, the <span class="accented">qualitative</span> relative (comp. <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; see Moulton's Winer, pp. 209, 210; also Meyer and Ellicott, on the grammatical point). A certain "word of wisdom" was ascribed to the false teachers in ver. 4 (note the play upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in St. Paul's Greek). They were plausible dealers in words, and had the jargon of philosophy at their tongue's end (ver. 8, compare note on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 18). On this the apostle had first remarked in his criticism of their teaching, and to this he first, adverts in his final <span class="accented">resume.</span> "Word of wisdom" is one of the "gifts of the Spirit" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>; but the disparaging <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">indeed</span>, with the emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> throwing <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> into the shade, in view also of the censures already passed in vers. 4, 8, puts a condemnatory sense upon the phrase: "having <span class="accented">word</span> indeed of wisdom" - "that and nothing more, no inner truth, no pith and substance of wisdom" (so Chrysostom and OEcumenius). "Word and deed," "word and truth," form a standing antithesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>, etc.), the second member of which supplies itself to the mind; and the <span class="accented">solitary</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> in such a connection is a well-established classical idiom (see Winer's or A. Buttmann's 'Grammar;' also Meyer). It is superfluous, therefore, as well as confusing to the order of thought, to seek in the sequel for the missing half of the antithesis. Other renderings of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> - "show" (English A.V., Bengel, De Wette), "ground" or "reason" (Vulgate, Klopper), <span class="accented">"reputation"</span> (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot) - are partly doubtful or exceptional in point of usage, and partly overlook the pointed reference of vers. 22, 23 to the language of vers. 4 and 8. And the combination of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> into a single phrase is scarcely justified here in face of the established Pauline association of "word" and "wisdom" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-2:16</a>, as well as 1 Corinthians 12:8). Both in this Epistle and in 1 Corinthians the writer is contending against forms of error which found their account in the Greek love of eloquence and of dexterous word-play. While the first part of the predicate, therefore, explains the <span class="accented">intellectual attractiveness</span> of the Colossian error, the clause next following accounts for its <span class="accented">religious fascination</span>; and the third part of the verse strikes at the root of its <span class="accented">ethical and practical applications.</span> (Shown) <span class="cmt_word">in</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>devotion to</span> (or, <span class="accented">delight in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>worship</span> (or, <span class="accented">voluntary worship</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and lowliness of mind</span> (ver. 18). The preposition "in" brings us into the moral and religious sphere of life in which this would be wisdom of doctrine had its range and found its application. The prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span> = - of<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ordinarily connotes" willingness" rather than "wilfulness;" and the "delighting in worship" of ver. 18 (see note) points strongly in this direction. As against Ellicott and Lightfoot on the etymological point, see Hofmann, pp. 102, 103. Only so far as the <span class="accented">worship</span> in question (see note, ver. 18, on "worship") is evil, can the <span class="accented">having a will to worship</span> be evil. The other characteristics of the error marked in this verse seem to be recommendations, and "devotion to worship" is in keeping with them. This disposition, moreover, has an air of "humility," which does not belong to a <span class="accented">self-imposed, arbitrary worship.</span> There is a love of worship for mere worship's sake which is a perversion of the religious instinct, and tends to multiply both the forms and objects of devotion. This spurious religiousness took the form, in the Colossian errorists, of <span class="accented">worship paid to the angels.</span> On this particular worship the apostle passed his judgment in ver. 18, and now points out the tendency from which it springs. In ver. 18 "humility" precedes; here it follows "worship," by way of transition from the religious to the moral aspect of the now teaching. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unsparing treatment of</span> (the) body - <span class="cmt_word">not in any honour</span> (as) <span class="cmt_word">against surfeiting of the flesh</span> (vers. 16, 21, 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm">1 Corinthians 12:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>). The "and" linking this clause to the last under the government of "in," is textually doubtful; Lightfoot cancels it; Westcott and Hort give the omission as a secondary reading. Mr. Hort regards the passage, like ver. 18, as hopelessly corrupt - a verdict which we would fain believe is too despairing. If <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> be struck out, then <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> must be attached, somewhat loosely, to the principal predicate (" are having") as an instrumental dative. On either construction, the sense appears to be that it was its combination of ascetic rigour with religious devotion that gave to the system in question its undoubted charm, and furnished an adequate field for the eloquence and philosophical skill of its advocate. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">unsparingness</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">surfeiting - both</span> found only here in the New Testament - and along with them "body" and "flesh," stand opposed to each other. This clause, therefore, contains a complete sense, and we must not look outside it for an explanation of the included words, "not in any honour." As we have seen, the first clause of the predicate (" having word indeed," etc.) needs no such complement. The clause "not .... flesh" is a comment on the words, "unsparing treatment of the body." On this topic the apostle had not yet expressed his mind sufficiently. He has in vers. 16, 20-22 denounced certain ascetic rules as obsolete, or as trifling and needless; but he has yet to expose the principle and tendency from which they sprang. He is the more bound to be explicit on this subject inasmuch as there were ascetic leanings in his own teaching, and passages in his earlier Epistles such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, which the "philosophical" party might net unnaturally wrest to their own purposes. He could not condemn severity to the body absolutely, and in every sense. The Colossian rigorism he does condemn - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as not <span class="accented">in keeping with bodily self-respect</span>, which is the safeguard of Christian purity; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as not in reality <span class="accented">directed against sensual indulgence</span>, the prevention of which is the proper end of rules of abstinence. These two objections are thrown into a single terse, energetic negative clause, obscure, like so much in this chapter, from its brevity and want of connecting particles. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> the phrase, "in honour," occurs in a similar connection: "That each one of you know how to 'gain possession of his own vessel" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to become master of his body:" see Wordsworth and Alford on the passage; also Meyer's reference on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>) "in sanctification and <span class="accented">honor"</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a> for the apostle's teaching respecting the dignity of the human body; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>). The contempt of Alexandrine theosophists for physical nature was fatal to morality, undermining the basis on which rests the government of the body as the "vessel" and vesture of the spiritual life. Their principles took effect, first, in a morbid and unnatural asceticism; then, by a sure reaction, and with equal consistency, in unrestrained and shocking licence. See, for the latter result, the Epistles to the seven Churches of Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. and 3.); in the Pastoral Epistles, the two opposite effects are both signalized. The rendering "value" given by Lightfoot and the Revisers seems to us misleading; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> means "value" only in the sense of "price," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>, and this surely is not their meaning. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> has been taken in a milder sense by the Greek commentators, Luther, and others: "satisfaction" "(<span class="accented">legitimate</span>) gratification." So the apostle is made to charge the false teachers with "not honouring the body, so as to grant the flesh its due gratification." But this rendering confounds the "body" and the "flesh," here contrasted, and gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> a meaning without lexical warrant (see Meyer and Lightfoot). And the sentiment it expresses errs on the anti-ascetic side, and comes into collision with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, in the LXX and in Philo, as in earlier Greek, denotes "physical repletion," and is associated with drunkenness and sensual excess generally. Hence we cannot admit the interpretation of Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, who make the "flesh" here the <span class="accented">sinful principle</span> generally, and understand "surfeiting" figuratively, supposing the apostle to mean, that the ascetic rules in question, while they dishonour the body, tend to gratify the carnal mind." This gives an idea true in itself, and agreeing with the sense of "flesh" in vers. 11, 18, but out of place here, while it strains the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> (see Lightfoot's exhaustive argument). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not help us, meaning "for" or "against," according to its connection. We combine Lightfoot's interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> with Wordsworth's and <span class="accented">Alford's</span> of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>. The saying of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a> ("whose god is their belly, and their glory in their shame") contains the same opposition of "honour" to "fleshly indulgence" as that supposed here, possibly suggested by the phrase, "surfeiting of dishonor" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), of the LXX in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>. Here, then, the apostle lays hold of the root principle of the false teachers' whole scheme of morality, its <span class="accented">hostility to the body as a material organism.</span> Such a treatment, he declares, dishonours the body, while it fails, and for this very reason, to prevent <span class="accented">that feeding of the flesh</span>, the fostering of sensual appetency and habit, in which lies our real peril and dishonour in regard to this vessel of our earthly life. Here we have a suitable starting-point for the exhortations of the next chapter, where the apostle, in vers. 1-4, shows the true path of deliverance from sensual sin, and in vers. 5-7 sets forth the Christian asceticism - "unsparing treatment" <span class="accented">of the flesh</span> indeed! The line of teaching adopted by the errorists may be illustrated by Philo's doctrine in his third book of the 'Allegories of the Sacred Law,' &sect; 22: "'God saw that Er was wicked;' for he knows that this <span class="accented">leathern burden</span> of ours, the body - for <span class="accented">Er</span>, being interpreted, is <span class="accented">leathern</span> - is evil and always plotting against the soul; and it is ever under the power of death, indeed actually dead [comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>]. Yet this all do not see, but only God, and those he loves. For when the mind [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> comp. note, ver. 18] becomes engaged in sublime contemplations and is initiated into the mysteries of the Lord [note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>], it judges the body to be evil and hostile;" again ('On the Change of Names,' &sect; 4): "Pale and wasted, and reduced to skeletons as it were, are the men devoted to instruction, having transferred to the powers of the soul their bodily vigour also, so that they have become, as we might say, dissolved into a single form of being, that of pure soul made bodiless by force of thought [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, note]. In them the earthly is destroyed and overwhelmed, when reason [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>: ver. 18], pervading them wholly, has see its choice on being well pleasing to God." The writer has attempted an elucidation of this verse in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 12. pp. 289-303. <p> <p> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.</body></html>
