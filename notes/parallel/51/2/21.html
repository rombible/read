There is in the commands a climax of strictness. "Handle not" (the unclean thing), "taste it not," "touch it not" with one of your fingers. It will be noted that all these commands are negative, not positive. They are marked by the ordinary ascetic preference of spiritual restraint to spiritual energy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span> gives examples of the <span class="accented">decrees</span> which the Colossians are blamed for regarding and in this respect more than in any other they seem to have yielded to the demands of the false teacher. <span class="cmt_word">Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch'</span> (vers. 16, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-12.htm">1 Corinthians 6:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm">1 Corinthians 10:25-27, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>). These rules form part of a prohibitory regimen by which sinful tendencies to bodily pleasure were to be repressed (ver. 23), and spiritual truths symbolically enforced (ver. 17; see note on "circumcision," ver. 11): comp. Philo, 'On Concupiscence;' also 'On Victims,' &sect; 3. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> the last of the three verbs, appears to be the strongest, forbidding the slightest con<span class="accented">tact.</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c8;&#x1fc3;</span> is better rendered "handle" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>); by itself it will scarcely bear the meaning it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>. The next verse seems to imply that all three verbs relate to matters of diet. Ambrose and other Latin Fathers of ascetic tendencies put these prohibitions into the mouth of St. Patti himself, reversing his meaning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.</body></html>
