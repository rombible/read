First, "All the fulness of the Godhead"--not a mere emanation from the Supreme Being. Next, "dwells" and remains for ever--not descending on Him for a time and leaving Him again. Lastly, "bodily," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as incarnate in His humanity. The whole is an extension and enforcement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>, "God was pleased that in Him all the fulness should dwell." The horror of all that was material, as having in it the seed of evil, induced denial either of the reality of our Lord's body, or of its inseparable connection with the Godhead in Him. Hence the emphasis here; as also we find (somewhat later) in St. John, "The Word was made flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>); "The spirit which confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . . . is the spirit of antichrist" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1John 4:3</a>).<p>On the meaning of "fullness" (<span class= "ital">plerorna</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm" title=" That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>. Here it is only necessary to add, that, as in the later Gnosticism, so probably in its earlier forms, the word was used for the infinite nature of the Supreme Deity, out of which all the emanations (afterwards called <span class= "ital">'ons</span>) received in various degrees of imperfection, according to their capacity. Probably for that reason St. Paul uses it so emphatically here. In the same spirit, St. John declares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>), <span class= "ital">"</span>Out of His (Christ's) fulness have all we received." It is not finite, but infinitely perfect; hence we all can draw from it, yet leave it unimpaired.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because in him dwelleth all the fulness</span> (or, <span class="accented">completeness</span>) of the Godhead bodily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18-20</a> we viewed a series of events; here we have an abiding fact. The whole plenitude of our Lord's Divine-human person and powers, as the complete Christ, was definitively constituted when, in the exercise of his kingly prerogative, "he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." "From henceforth" that fulness evermore <span class="accented">resides in him</span> (comp. note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>). The undivided <span class="accented">pleroma</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a> now reveals its twofold nature: it is "the fulness of the Godhead," and yet "dwells corporeally in him." "Godhead" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) is the abstract of "God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), not of the adjective "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate therefore, wrongly, <span class="accented">divinitatis:</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>; Wisd. 18:9), and denotes,"not Divine excellences, but the Divine nature" (Bengel); see Trench's 'Synonyms.' Schenkel and others, guided by a conjecture of Theodoret, have found here the <span class="accented">Church</span>, supporting their view by a very doubtful interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. Still more groundless is the identification of this <span class="accented">pleroma</span> with <span class="accented">the created world.</span> The apostle unmistakably affirms that the Divine nature, in its entirety, belongs to the Church's Christ. The literal sense of "bodily" (maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Hofmann, after Chrysostom and Athanasius) has been avoided by those who render it "wholly" (Jerome); "essentially, substantially" (Cyril, Theophylact, Calvin, Klopper), as opposed to "relatively" or "partially;" "truly" (Augustine, Erasmus, Bengel, Bleek), as opposed to "figuretively" (ver. 17). The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (always <span class="accented">literal</span> in classical usage, along with its adjective) occurs only here in the New Testament; the adjective "bodily" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>. "The body of his flesh" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> affords a truer parallel than the language of ver. 17, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, bears an exceptional sense (see note). Elsewhere St. Paul balances in similar fashion expressions relating to the twofold nature of Christ (see parallels). The assertion that "all the fulness of Deity" dwells in Christ negatives the Alexandrine "philosophy," with its cloud of mediating angel powers and spiritual emanations; the assertion that it dwells in him <span class="accented">bodily</span> equally condemns that contempt for the body and the material world which was the chief practical tenet of the same school (comp. notes on Colossians 1:22 and Colossians 2:23). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.</body></html>
