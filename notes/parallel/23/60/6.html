These would be composed of merchants from Midian and Ephah, and would bring goods from Sheba. The Midianite caravans of camels are mentioned as early as the time of Jacob, when they carried "spicery and balm and myrrh" from the land of Gilead into Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25, 28, 36</a>). Ephah is a sub-tribe of Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-4.htm">Genesis 25:4</a>). These nomads would visit the distant Sheba, in Happy Arabia, for purposes of trade, and would procure there gold and incense, which they would convey to Palestine. The "Sheba" intended is doubtless that whose queen visited Solomon, and brought with her gold in abundance, and "of spices very great store, and precious stones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>). The Egyptians appear to have called the kingdom of the Shebaim (Sabaeans) "Punt," and to have traded with it from a very early time, especially for frankincense (' Records of the Past,' vol. 10. pp. 14-19; Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 132-134, 221-224). <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">dromedaries</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the young camels</span>, or <span class="accented">the camel colts. <span class="cmt_word"></span>All they</span> <span class="cmt_word">from Sheba shall come;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (i.e. the camels of Midian and Ephah) <span class="accented">shall come all together from Sheba.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:1-8 As far as we have the knowledge of God in us, and the favour of God towards us, our light is come. And if God's glory is seen upon us to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives, to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jews which can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; we must conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts the purity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is here described. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and ordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter, thither they fly for rest. What a pleasant sight to see poor souls hastening to Christ!</body></html>
