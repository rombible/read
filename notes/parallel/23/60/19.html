Sun and moon may still shine, but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a> (obviously derived from this), they shall not be needed in the radiance of the greater glory of the presence of Jehovah. Here on earth the sun sets and the moon wanes, but in that Divine glory there is no waning and no setting. "Mourning" will belong to the past (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm" title="And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.">Revelation 21:4</a>), everlasting joy to the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - The <span class="accented">fifth stanza.</span> Zion's crowning glories. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun shall be no more thy light by day</span>. Here Isaiah anticipates one of the most sublime thoughts in the Revelation of St. John the Divine, viz. that the heavenly Jerusalem, illuminated perpetually by the radiance of the Divine Presence, shall need neither light of the sun by day, nor of the moon by night, but shall be sufficiently illumined by the direct and primary light which streams down upon it from God himself. Whether the sun and moon will continue to exist or not is beyond the prophet's ken - he makes no announcement on the subject; sufficient for him that the redeemed bask perpetually in a Divine radiance shed upon them by the "Father of lights" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>). The germ of the idea appears in the earlier prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For brightness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="accented">illumination. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light</span>. God is "the Father of lights" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>) - "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). All other light is but his shadow and his reflex - his creature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>) - therefore perishable, not to be reckoned on for continuance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>). But God abides; therefore his light will abide. He is "the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy God thy glory</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>). God will not only be the Light of the Church, but her "Glory" and boast. As the Shechinah was the glory of the first, so "the eternal unchangeable light of Jehovah, with its peaceful gentleness and perfect purity" (Delitzsch), will be the glory of the final temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:15-22 We must look for the full accomplishment in times and things, exceeding those of the Old Testament church. The nations and their kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, as discovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall be changed for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats of those that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence. Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written upon with praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images and expressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, Re 21:23; 22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of the church on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Those that make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficient light. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people on earth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. They shall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be made perfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When it shall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem too difficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power has undertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord will hasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the time prescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties, and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entrance into this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</body></html>
