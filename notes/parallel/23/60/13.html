The cedars of Lebanon, and other trees of the forest, are to furnish timber for its buildings, or even to be planted in the courts of the Temple, or in its open places and streets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm" title="But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/92-12.htm" title="The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.">Psalm 92:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm" title="It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.">Isaiah 35:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The box </span>is probably, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-19.htm" title="I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:">Isaiah 41:19</a>, a species of cedar.<p><span class= "bld">The place of my feet </span>is clearly parallel with the "sanctuary" of the previous clause. So the word "footstool" is used of the Temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-5.htm" title="Exalt you the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.">Psalm 99:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm" title="We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.">Psalm 132:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The glory of Lebanon shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">come</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>). Considered as imagery, the representation is that the barren hills which stand about Jerusalem shall, in the new state of things, be decked with tall and beautiful forest trees, all the sylvan scenery of Lebanon being transported to Southern Palestine, so as to encompass the city of God with a garden as delightful as that of Eden. The spiritual meaning is that graces of all kinds shall abound in and around the holy city, and shall make it beautiful and glorious. <span class="cmt_word">The fir tree, the pine</span> <span class="cmt_word">tree, and the box together</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>, where the same words occur in the same order; and, for the trees intended, see the comment on that passage). <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">beautify the place of my sanctuary</span>. Not with "avenues of cedars and plane trees leading up to it" (Delitzsch), which was a style of ornamentation quite unknown to the lie-brews; but with groves, and thickets, and sylvan glades, and wooded slopes all around it, as round the Syrian temples in the Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">The place of my feet</span>. The Jewish temple, as the special place of God's presence upon earth, was frequently termed "God's footstool" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>). He that towers above the heavens had there set his foot. The metaphor is transferred to the renovated Zion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:9-14 God will be very gracious. We must begin with his promise, thence all mercies take rise. Many shall be brought into the church, even from far countries. Christ is always ready to receive all who come to him; and the gate of mercy is always open, night and day. All that are about the church shall be made serviceable to it. But those who will not be subject to Christ's golden sceptre, to his word and Spirit, who will not be kept in by the laws and rules of his family, shall be broken in pieces by his iron rod. The peculiar advantages of every nation, and of every description of men, shall join to beautify the church of Christ. We must suppose this to be accomplished in the beauties of holiness, and the graces and comforts of the Spirit, with which gospel ordinances are adorned and enriched. Blessed be his name, the gates of Zion are ever open to returning sinners.</body></html>
