The Bridegroom is away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>); his light shines upon his Church only by snatches; his Church feels itself unworthy of him - cold, unloving, stained with sin. Fasting, weeping, and mourning befit such a state of things. But in the final condition of the redeemed their mourning shall be ended, "sorrow and sighing shall have fled away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>); God shall have "wiped away all tears from their eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "There shall be no more death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "no more curse" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>); "neither sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). The days of mourning shall be ended. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:15-22 We must look for the full accomplishment in times and things, exceeding those of the Old Testament church. The nations and their kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, as discovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall be changed for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats of those that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence. Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written upon with praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images and expressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, Re 21:23; 22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of the church on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Those that make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficient light. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people on earth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. They shall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be made perfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When it shall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem too difficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power has undertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord will hasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the time prescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties, and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entrance into this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</body></html>
