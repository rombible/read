The two words occur as the names of birds only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">So did I chatter</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so did I scream</span> (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">I did mourn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I did moan. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Mine eyes fail with looking upward;</span> rather, <span class="accented">mine eyes are weak to look upward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have scarcely the courage or the strength to look to Jehovah; yet still I do look to him falteringly, and make my appeal: <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>); literally, be <span class="accented">Surety for me.</span> "The image," as Mr. Cheyne says, "is that of a debtor, who is being dragged to prison" at the suit of an exacting creditor, and for whom there is but one hope of relief; viz. if he can obtain a sufficient surety. Hezekiah calls on God to be the Surety; but God is the Creditor! Still, there is an appeal from God's justice to God's mercy - from Jehovah who punishes to Jehovah who forgives sin; and this appeal Hezekiah seems to intend to make when he beseeches God to "undertake for him." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:9-22 We have here Hezekiah's thanksgiving. It is well for us to remember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do good.</body></html>
