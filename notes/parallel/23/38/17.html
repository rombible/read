A slight change, such as might be made to correct an error of transcription, would give that meaning, but as it stands, we have the singularly suggestive phrase, <span class= "ital">Thou hast loved me out of the pit of corruption. </span>The very love of Jehovah is thought of as <span class= "ital">ipso facto </span>a deliverance.<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast cast all my sins . . .</span>--As in our Lord's miracles, the bodily healing was the pledge and earnest of the spiritual. "Arise and walk" guaranteed, "Thy sins be forgiven thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2-5</a>). (For the symbols of that forgiveness, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-19.htm" title="He will turn again, he will have compassion on us; he will subdue our iniquities; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.">Micah 7:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, for peace I had great bitterness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">behold</span>, <span class="accented">it was for my</span> <span class="accented">peace that I had such bitterness</span>, <span class="accented">such bitterness.</span> The pain that I underwent was for the true peace and comfort of my soul (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-75.htm">Psalm 119:75</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast in love</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">thou hast loved my soul back from the pit of destruction - as</span> if God's love, beaming on the monarch's soul, had drawn it back from the edge of the pit (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a>, "I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love"). <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back</span>. Where they could be no more seen, and therefore would be no more remembered (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-9.htm">Isaiah 64:9</a>, etc.). Hezekiah, though lately he protested his integrity (ver. 3). did not mean to say that he was sinless, lie knew that he had sinned; he regarded his sins as having brought down upon him the sentence of death; as God has revoked the sentence, he knows that he has pardoned his sins and put them away from his remembrance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:9-22 We have here Hezekiah's thanksgiving. It is well for us to remember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do good.</body></html>
