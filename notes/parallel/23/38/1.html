So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-6.htm" title="And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.">Isaiah 38:6</a>, the deliverance of the city is spoken of as still future. Assuming the rectified chronology given above, we are carried to a time ten or eleven years before the invasion, which was probably in part caused by the ambitious schemes indicated in Isaiah 39. It follows from either view that we have no ground for assuming, as some commentators have done, (1) that the illness was an attack of the plague that destroyed the Assyrian army, or (2) that the treasures which Hezekiah showed to the Babylonian ambassadors were in part the spoil of that army.<p><span class= "bld">Set thine house in order.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Give orders to thy house, </span>euphemistic for "make thy will." The words are a striking illustration, like Jonah's announcement that Nineveh should be destroyed in three days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm" title="And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.">Jonah 3:4</a>), of the conditional character of prophecy. It would seem as if Isaiah had been consulted half as prophet and half as physician as to the nature of the disease. It seemed to him fatal; it was necessary to prepare for death. The words may possibly imply a certain sense of disappointment at the result of Hezekiah's reign. In the midst of the king's magnificence and prosperity there was that in the inner house of the soul, as well as in that of the outer life, which required ordering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days</span>. The illness of Hezekiah is fixed by ver. 5 (and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a>) to the fourteenth year of his reign, or <span class="date">B.C. 714</span>. The entire narrative of this chapter and the next is therefore thirteen or fourteen years earlier than that of ch. 36, 37, which belongs to Hezekiah's closing years, <span class="date">B.C. 701-698</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 26:l, 2). <span class="cmt_word">Sick unto death</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> attacked by a malady which, if it had run its natural course, would have been fatal. <span class="cmt_word">Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz</span>. This double designation of Isaiah, by his office and by his descent, marks the original independence of this narrative, which was not intended for a continuation of ch. 37. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt die, and not live</span>. Prophecies were often threats, and, when such, were conditional, announcing results which would follow unless averted by prayer or repentance (compare Jonah's prophecy, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-8 When we pray in our sickness, though God send not to us such an answer as he here sent to Hezekiah, yet, if by his Spirit he bids us be of good cheer, assures us that our sins are forgiven, and that, whether we live or die, we shall be his, we do not pray in vain. See 2Ki 20:1-11.</body></html>
