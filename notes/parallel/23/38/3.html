He rests on what he has done in the way of religious reformation, and practically asks what he has done that he should be cut off by an untimely death. The tears may probably have been less egotistic than the words, and, therefore, were more prevailing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember now, O Lord</span>. Hezekiah was in the full vigour of life - thirty-nine years old only. He had probably as yet no son, since Manasseh, who succeeded him, was but twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-1.htm">2 Chronicles 33:1</a>) when Hezekiah died at the age of fifty-four. It was a grievous thing to a Jew to leave no male offspring: it was viewed as a mark of the Divine displeasure to be cut off in the midst of one's days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15, 16</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>). Hezekiah asked himself - Had he deserved such a sentence? He thought that he had not. He knew that, with whatever shortcomings, he had endeavoured to serve God, had trusted in him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>), cleaved to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>), "departed not from following him, but kept his commandments" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>) He therefore ventured upon an expostulation and an earnest prayer; and God was pleased to hear the prayer and to grant it. <span class="cmt_word">I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart</span>. Compare the unbiased testimony of the authors of Kings and Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-2.htm">2 Chronicles 29:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-20.htm">2 Chronicles 31:20, 21</a>). Under the old dispensation, there was nothing to prevent men from pleading their righteousness before God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>-2; 18:20-24; 26:1-8, etc.). Hezekiah, however, does not really regard himself as sinless (comp. ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah wept sore</span>. In the East feelings are but little restrained. Joy shows itself in laughter and shouting, grief in tears and shrill cries. Xerxes wept when he thought of the shortness of human life (Herod., 7:46); the Persians rent the air with load cries at the funeral of Masistius (ibid., 9:24); on the news of the defeat at Salamis all Susa "cried aloud, and wept and wailed without stint" (ibid., 8:99). So David wept for Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>) and again for Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-1.htm">2 Samuel 19:1</a>); Joash wept when he heard the words of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a>); Nehemiah wept at the desolation of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>); the ambassadors of Hezekiah, when disappointed of the object of their embassy, "wept bitterly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). No king in the East puts himself under any restraint, if he has an inclination for either tears or laughter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-8 When we pray in our sickness, though God send not to us such an answer as he here sent to Hezekiah, yet, if by his Spirit he bids us be of good cheer, assures us that our sins are forgiven, and that, whether we live or die, we shall be his, we do not pray in vain. See 2Ki 20:1-11.</body></html>
