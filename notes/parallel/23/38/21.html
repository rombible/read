They were to Israel, especially in the case of leprosy and other kindred diseases, what the priests of Asclepios were to Greece. The Divine promise guaranteed success to the use of natural remedies, but did not dispense with them, and they, like the spittle laid on the eyes of the blind in the Gospel miracles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-33.htm" title="And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;">Mark 7:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm" title="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,">John 9:6</a>), were also a help to the faith on which the miracle depended. Both this and the following verse seem, as has been said, to have been notes to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-8.htm" title="Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.">Isaiah 38:8</a>, supplied from the narrative of 2 Kings 20, and placed at the end of the chapter instead of at the foot of the page, as in modern MSS. or print. The word for "boil" appears in connection with leprosy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-9.htm" title="And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains on man, and on beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.">Exodus 9:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-18.htm" title="The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,">Leviticus 13:18</a>, but is used generically for any kind of abscess, carbuncle, and the like. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm" title="So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.">Job 2:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Isaiah had said</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and Isaiah said.</span> It seems as if this verse and the next had been <span class="accented">accidentally</span> omitted from their proper place in the narrative, which was between vers. 6 and 7, and had then been appended by an after-thought. They reproduce nearly, but not exactly, the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-7.htm">2 Kings 19:7, 8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Let them take a lump of figs</span>. This remedy is said to be one still employed in the East for the cure of ordinary boils; but it must have been quite insufficient for the cure of such a dangerous tumour, or carbuncle, as that from which Hezekiah was suffering. In miraculous cures, both the Old Testament prophets and our Lord himself frequently employed a means, insufficient in itself, but supernaturally rendered sufficient, to effect the intended purpose (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-35.htm">2 Kings 4:35, 41, 5</a>:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Upon the boil</span>. The term here translated "boil" is used in Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9-11</a>) for the affliction which constituted the sixth plague, in Leviticus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-18.htm">Leviticus 13:18-23</a>) for an ulcer accompanying one of the worst forms of leprosy, in Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 35</a>) for "the botch of Egypt," and in Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>) for the last of the visitations from which he suffered. It is not unlikely that it was of a leprous character. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:9-22 We have here Hezekiah's thanksgiving. It is well for us to remember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do good.</body></html>
