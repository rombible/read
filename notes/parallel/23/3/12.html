Here the emphatic words are "children," "women." <span class="cmt_word">Children</span> (see ver. 4). The rulers are "children," or rather "babes" - foolish, capricious, cowardly. It is not clear that any prince in particular is meant; rather, by the plural form, the upper class generally seems to be intended, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10, 17, 23</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Women</span>; comp.

Blessed be God, there is abundant encouragement to the righteous to trust in him, and for sinners to repent and return to him. It was time for the Lord to show his might. He will call men to a strict account for all the wealth and power intrusted to and abused by them. If it is sinful to disregard the necessities of the poor, how odious and wicked a part do they act, who bring men into poverty, and then oppress them!</body></html>
