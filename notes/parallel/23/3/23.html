Jewish women, however, did not veil their faces after the manner of those of Turkey and Arabia. The prophet seems to have carried his eye upward from the feet to the head, as he catalogued with indignant scorn the long list of superfluities. We may compare the warnings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm" title="Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;">1Peter 3:3</a>. It is noticeable that stockings and handkerchiefs do not seem to have been used by the women of Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The glasses</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the mirrors</span>. In ancient times these were not made of glass, but of some metal which took a high polish. Most commonly, the material seems to have been bronze. Many such mirrors have been found in Egypt, a few in Assyria, in Etruria a considerable number. They are of small size, intended to be carried in the hand, and have for that purpose a metal or a wooden handle, which is sometimes highly artistic. <span class="cmt_word">The fine linen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the muslin robes</span>. <span class="accented">Sedin</span>, the Hebrew word used, is probably a corruption or analogue of <span class="accented">sin-</span>don, the Greek name for Indian fabrics. It is only used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The hoods, and the vails</span>; or, <span class="accented">the turbans and the scarfs</span>. The word translated" hood" is nearly the same as that which designates the head-dress of the high priest in Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4, 37, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>, etc.) and Leviticus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-9.htm">Leviticus 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), which seems to have been a "turban" (see note on Exodus 28:4). The other word, here translated "vail," occurs only in this place and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-7.htm">Song of Solomon 5:7</a>. Its exact meaning is uncertain; but it can scarcely be a veil; since "veils" have been already mentioned (ver. 19). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-26 The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of the sufferings coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.</body></html>
