Manasseh was but twelve when he became king; Josiah but eight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-1.htm" title="Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:">2Chronicles 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-1.htm" title="Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.">2Chronicles 34:1</a>). In an Eastern monarchy the rule of a young king, rash and without experience, guided by counsellors like himself, was naturally regarded as the greatest of evils, and the history of Rehoboam had impressed this truth on the mind of every Israelite. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm" title="Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!">Ecclesiastes 10:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give children</span> <span class="cmt_word">to be their princes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">youths</span> than "children." The extreme youth of the later kings of Judah at the date of their accession is very remarkable. After Hezekiah, only one was as much as twenty-five years old when he came to the throne. Jehoahaz was twenty-three (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>); Amon, twenty-two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-19.htm">2 Kings 21:19</a>); Zedekiah twenty-one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>); Jehoiachin, eighteen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>); Manasseh, twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>); and Josiah eight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>). Thus this prophecy was fulfilled to the letter. <span class="cmt_word">And babes shall rule over them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">puerilities shall rule over them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the youths shall behave in a childish way. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it on themselves.</body></html>
