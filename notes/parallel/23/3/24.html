The word used occurs only in this place. <span class="cmt_word">Instead of well-set hair baldness</span> (compare above, ver. 17). By "well-set hair" seems to be meant "hair arranged with such exactness and order as to look like a work of art." The exact arrangement of the hair is very remarkable, both in the Egyptian and the Assyrian sculptures. Instead of such elaborate attempts to improve their looks, the daughters of Jerusalem would soon pluck their hair out by the roots, or shave it off, in mourning. <span class="cmt_word">A girding of sackcloth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>, etc.; and for the adoption of the custom by women, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Burning instead of beauty</span>. This meaning is now generally acknowledged, the sense of "burning" being borne out by the cognate verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-28.htm">Proverbs 6:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, and the cognate noun used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-25.htm">Exodus 21:25</a>. The" burning" intended is probably branding by a barbarous enemy (see Herod., 7:233; 'Hist. Tamerlau.,' p. 320). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-26 The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of the sufferings coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.</body></html>
