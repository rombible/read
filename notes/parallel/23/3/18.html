Anklets were worn by the Egyptian women from the time of the twelfth dynasty (about <span class="date">B.C. 1900</span>). They were, in general, plain rings of metal, but appear to have been sometimes set with precious stones (see Lepsius, 'Denkmaler,' pt. 2. pls. 128, 129). No bells appear attached to any; but bells were known in Assyria from the time of Sennacherib ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 417, 2nd edit.). Their cauls; margin, <span class="accented">networks</span>. The marginal rendering is probably correct (comp. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). Network caps to contain the hair seem to be intended (so Kimchi, Saadiah, Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kay). Mr. Cheyne prefers "wreaths worn round the forehead, reaching from one ear to the other." <span class="cmt_word">Round tires like the moon; rather, crescents</span>. Flat ornaments in metal, like a young moon, generally worn suspended round the neck (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, where the same word occurs). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-26 The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of the sufferings coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.</body></html>
