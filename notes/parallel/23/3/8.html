Of sins of speech the only one specified is the open and shameless declaration of their wickedness (ver. 9). Under the head of sins of act are enumerated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> childishness and effeminacy; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> irreligion and leading people away from God (ver. 12); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> oppression of the poor and afflicted (vers. 14, 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The enumeration of the sins is mixed with exhortation and comment in such a way as to give rise to the conjecture that we have here, not the original prophecy as the author penned it, but a later "summary" of several prophetical discourses, which summary itself is "a little fragmentary" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem is ruined</span>; or, has <span class="accented">come to ruin</span> - the "perfect of prophetic certainty" (Cheyne) - (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-2.htm">Amos 5:2</a>, "The virgin of Israel <span class="accented">is fallen"</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Their tongue and their doings</span>. Sins of the tongue are denounced in the Old Testament as well as in the New, though not, perhaps, so frequently (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To provoke the eyes of his glory</span>. This is an unusual metaphor. God's glory seems here to be identified with himself, as being of his very essence; and thus "provoking the eyes of his glory" is simply provoking him to look on them with anger. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it on themselves.</body></html>
