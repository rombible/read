The elder brother, the impoverished owner of the ruined dwelling, the head of a family or village, turns in his rags to the younger, whose decent garments seem to indicate comparative wealth, and would fain transfer to him the responsibilities of the first-born, though he has but a ruined tenement to give him. And instead of accepting what most men would have coveted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/25-31.htm" title="And Jacob said, Sell me this day your birthright.">Genesis 25:31-33</a>), the younger brother rejects it. He has enough bread and clothing (same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm" title="For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he cries to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.">Exodus 22:27</a>) for himself, and no more.

Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it on themselves.</body></html>
