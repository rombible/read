give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:10</a>. In the reign of Ahaz (perhaps the prophet, editing in his old age, thought also of that of Manasseh) there was not even the homage which vice pays to virtue by feigning a virtue which it has not. Men fell into an utter shamelessness, like that of the cities of the plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-5.htm" title="And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men which came in to you this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.">Genesis 19:5</a>), generally in the luxury and profligacy of their lives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm" title="Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.">Ezekiel 16:49</a>), perhaps also with a more definite and horrible resemblance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-24.htm" title="And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.">1Kings 14:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-12.htm" title="And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.">1Kings 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm" title="And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.">2Kings 23:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Woe unto their soul</span>!--In the midst of the confusions of the times the prophet is bidden to proclaim that the law of a righteous retribution would be seen working even there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The show of their countenance doth witness against them.</span> This is not in itself a sin, but it is a sign of frequent and habitual sin. Vice, long indulged in, stamps its mark upon the countenance, giving men what is called "a bad expression" - a guilty and hardened look. It does not require a skilled physiognomist to detect at a glance the habitual criminal or sensualist. <span class="cmt_word">They declare their sin as Sodom.</span> Not only does their countenance betray them, but, like the Sodomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-5.htm">Genesis 19:5, 9</a>), they boldly and impudently declare their wicked purposes beforehand, and make no attempt at concealment. Hypocrisy has been said to be the homage that vice pays to virtue. Where there is none, where vice has ceased to shroud or veil itself, a very advanced stage of wickedness has been reached. <span class="cmt_word">They have rewarded evil unto themselves.</span> They have "received <span class="accented">in themselves</span> the recompense of their error which was meet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>). Their sins have at once marred their countenance and injured their moral nature. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it on themselves.</body></html>
