So we have the three "captains of fifty" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/1-9.htm" title="Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.">2Kings 1:9-15</a>. The "honourable man" (literally, <span class= "ital">eminent in countenance</span>) would seem to occupy a position in the civil service of the State analogous to that of the "captain of fifty" in the military.<p><span class= "bld">The counsellor, and the cunning artificer.</span>--From the modern stand-point the two classes seem at opposite extremes of the social order. The latter, however (literally, <span class= "ital">masters in arts</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>would seem to have occupied a higher position in the East, like that of military or civil engineers or artists with us. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2Kings 24:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, the "craftsmen and the smiths" are grouped with the "men of might" who were carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, and contrasted with the poor who were left behind. The military works of Uzziah had doubtless given a prominence to the "cunning men" who were employed on them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm" title="And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and on the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones with. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.">2Chronicles 26:15</a>). By some critics, however, the word is taken as equal to "magician."<p><span class= "bld">The eloquent orator.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">skilled in speech. </span>The Authorised Version suggests the idea of the power of such skill in controlling the debates of popular assemblies. Here, however, the thought is rather that of one who says the right words at the right time; or possibly the enchanter who has his formulae (the word implies the whisper of incantations, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>) ready at command for all occasions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The captain of fifty</span>. "Captains of fifties" were scarcely at this period "civil officers" (Cheyne). They represent simply the lowest grade of officers in the army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9, 11, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Honorable</span>. The same expression is used again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>. It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a>.

"All the craftsmen and smiths" in Jerusalem were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar in the captivity of Jehoiachin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>). They were among the most valuable of the population, in time of war no less than of peace, since on them depended the construction and repair of the military engines which were regarded as of so much importance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The eloquent orator</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the expert enchanter</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, Joh 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it on themselves.</body></html>
