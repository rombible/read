The girdle itself was used as a purse by men. This was a refinement of female luxury.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The changeable suite of apparel</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the festival robes</span> (Revised Version), or <span class="accented">the full-dress suits</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those worn upon grand occasions, and then put off and set aside. <span class="cmt_word">The mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the upper petticoats</span>, <span class="accented">the wraps</span>, <span class="accented">and the purses</span>. An inner and an outer tunic or petticoat were commonly worn by females of the higher class in the East. The inner tunic was a simple linen vest; but the outer was generally of a better material, and richly ornamented. Outside this, a sort of wrap, or cloak, was worn occasionally (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>). Purses were, no doubt, carried by wealthy persons of both sexes; but their mention in this list does not seem very appropriate. Perhaps toilet-bags of some kind or other are intended (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-26 The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of the sufferings coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.</body></html>
