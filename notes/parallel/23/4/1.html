It comes as the climax of the chastisement of the daughters of Zion, as the companion picture to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm" title="When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, You have clothing, be you our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand:">Isaiah 3:6</a>. As men sought eagerly, yet in vain, a protector, so women should seek for a husband. Those who had been wooed and courted, and had been proudly fastidious, should supplicate in eager rivalry (the seven women to one man implies a land depopulated by war, and so making polygamy natural) for the protection of marriage, and that not on the usual conditions of having food and clothing found for them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm" title="If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.">Exodus 21:10</a>), but as working for their own livelihood.<p><span class= "bld">To take away our reproach.</span>--Better, as an imperative, <span class= "ital">take thou away. </span>The reproach is that of being childless. From the Jewish standpoint that was not only the great sorrow, but the great shame, of womanhood, implying, as men thought, a sin of which it was the chastisement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-23.htm" title="And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God has taken away my reproach:">Genesis 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-6.htm" title="And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.">1Samuel 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-25.htm" title="Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.">Luke 1:25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven women shall take hold of one man.</span> This verse has been well called a "companion picture to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6, 7</a>." As there, in the evil time of God's judgment, the despairing men are represented as" taking hold" of a respectable man to make him their judge, so now the despairing women "take hold" of such a man and request him to allow them all to be regarded as his wives. There has been such a destruction - men are become so scarce - that no otherwise can women escape the shame and reproach of being unwedded and childless. <span class="cmt_word">Our own bread will we eat</span>. They do not ask him to support them; they are able and willing to support themselves. <span class="cmt_word">To take away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">take thou away -</span> the imperative mood, not the infinitive. <span class="cmt_word">Our reproach</span>. Children were regarded as such a blessing in the ancient times that to be childless was a misfortune and a subject of reproach. Hagar "despised" the barren Sarai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). Her "adversary provoked Hannah sore, because the Lord had shut up her womb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>). Compare the lament of Antigone, who views it as a disgrace that she descends to the tomb unwed (Soph., 'Antig.,' 11. 813-816). Among the Jews childlessness was a special reproach, because it took away all possibility of the woman being in the line of the Messiah's descent (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1 This first verse belongs to the third chapter. When the troubles should come upon the land, as the unmarried state was deemed reproachful among the Jews, these women would act contrary to common usage, and seek husbands for themselves.</body></html>
