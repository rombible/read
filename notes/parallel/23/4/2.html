The "day" is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm" title="In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,">Isaiah 3:18</a>, the time of Jehovah's judgments.<p><span class= "bld">The branch of the Lord . . .</span>--The thought of the "branch," though not the Hebrew word, is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>. The word itself is found in the Messianic prophecies of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm" title="In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>. The two latter probably inherited both the thought and the word from this passage. Here, then, if we thus interpret the words, we have the first distinct prophecy in Isaiah of a personal Messiah. He is the "Branch of Jehovah," raised up by Him, accepted by Him. And the appearance of that Branch has as its accompaniment (the poetic parallelism here being that at once of a resemblance and of contrast) the restoration of outward fertility. That thought Isaiah had inherited from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm" title="There shall be an handful of corn in the earth on the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.">Psalm 72:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, said the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;">Hosea 2:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.">Amos 9:13</a>. He transmitted it to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-27.htm" title="And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.">Ezekiel 34:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/9-16.htm" title="And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign on his land.">Zechariah 9:16-17</a>. The interpretation which takes "the branch [or growth] of the Lord" in its lower sense, as used collectively for "vegetation," and, therefore, parallel and all but synonymous with the "fruits of the earth," seems to miss the true meaning. Rabbinic exegesis may be of little weight, but the acceptance of the term as Messianic by Jeremiah and Zechariah is surely conclusive. It will be noted that the prophecy of the Branch (<span class= "ital">tsemach</span>) here comes after a picture of desolation, just as that of the Branch (<span class= "ital">netzer</span>) does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>. The thought seems applied by our Lord to Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For them that are escaped of Israel.</span>--These are, of course, identical with the "remnant" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm" title="Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>, to whom the prophet had been taught to look as to the trusted depositaries of the nation's future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - As the present prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2-4</a>.), though in the main one of threatening and denunciation, opened with a picture that was encouraging and comforting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>), so new it terminates with a similar picture. The evangelical prophet, like the great apostle of the Gentiles, is unwilling that any one should be "swallowed up with overmuch sorrow." He will not separate the mercies of God from his judgments. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day shall the branch of the Lord</span>, etc. Some see in this passage merely a promise that in the Messianic times the produce of the soil would become more abundant than ever before, its harvests richer, and its fruitage more luxuriant. But in the light of later prophecy it is scarcely possible to shut up the meaning within such narrow limits. The "Branch" of Isaiah can hardly be isolated altogether in a sound exegesis from the "Branch" of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>) and of Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>). Now, the "Branch" of Zechariah is stated to be "a man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>: note that the word used for "Branch" is the same as Isaiah's, viz. <span class="accented">tsemakh</span>), and the "Branch "of Jeremiah is a King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>). Moreover, Isaiah uses a nearly equivalent term (<span class="accented">netser</span>) in an admittedly Messianic sense. Although, therefore, there is some obscurity in the phrase, "<span class="accented">Branch</span> <span class="accented">of Jehovah</span>," it would seem to be best to understand Isaiah as here intimating, what he elsewhere openly declares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-5</a>) - viz. the coming of the Messiah in the latter days as the ornament and glory of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Be beautiful and glorious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for beauty and glory</span>; or, <span class="accented">for ornament and glory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the ornament and glorification of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And the fruit of the earth</span>. It is argued with reason that the two clauses of this verse are parallel, not antithetical, and that as we understand the one, so must we understand the other. If, then, the "<span class="accented">Branch"</span> is the Messiah, so is "the fruit of the earth"-which may well be, since he was "the grain of wheat" which "fell into the ground and, lied, and so brought forth much fruit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Excellent and comely</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for majesty and beauty</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2, 40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the escaped of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to those who shall have our-rived the great calamity, and become citizens of the restored Jerusalem." Dr. Kay well remarks that "the prophecy was adequately fulfilled only in those who 'saved themselves' from the generation which rejected Christ. That remnant was the germ of the Catholic Church, made such by being incorporated into the true Vine" ('Speaker's Commentary,' note <span class="accented">at loc</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 Not only the setting forth Christ's kingdom in the times of the apostles, but its enlargement by gathering the dispersed Jews into the church, is foretold. Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, being planted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is the fruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, because it sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. It will be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merely called Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, and holiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. God will keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a place and a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by their unbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left, when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing which offends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyed and consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed and converted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning, quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealously affected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zeal against sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as a furnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening, and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out their lusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church, and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the glory of the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those that have it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary will seek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching, will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divine displeasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once have recourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.</body></html>
