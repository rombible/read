The prophet has not forgotten the daughters of Zion. Jehovah will wash away, as with the baptism of repentance, the "filth," the moral uncleanness, that lay beneath their outward show of beauty. The "blood of Jerusalem," in the next verse, has a wide range of meaning, from the "murders" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm" title="And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a>, to the Moloch sacrifices in which the women had borne a conspicuous part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-38.htm" title="And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.">Psalm 106:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?">Isaiah 57:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/22-2.htm" title="Now, you son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? yes, you shall show her all her abominations.">Ezekiel 22:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</span>--The word for "spirit" is better taken in its more literal meaning, as <span class= "ital">breath </span>or <span class= "ital">blast, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows on it: surely the people is grass.">Isaiah 40:7</a>. The words indicate that the prophet saw in the "blood" of which he speaks a greater enormity than that of the daughters of Zion. The one might be washed away. The other needed, as it were, the "fiery baptism" of the wrath of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>.) The Authorised Version "burning" represents the root-meaning of the word, but it is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-5.htm" title="And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he has spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust you out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put the evil away from the middle of you.">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-7.htm" title="The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people.

Sin must not be merely repented of and pardoned; it must be put away. There could be no Jerusalem, in which all should be "called holy," until the moral defilement of the daughters of Zion was swept away. <span class="cmt_word">Purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>). It is possible, however, that the murder of infants in sacrifice to Moloch may be in the prophet's mind. Ahaz "<span class="accented">burnt</span> his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). Manasseh did the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>): and the practice was probably widespread among the people long before Isaiah's time (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the spirit of burning</span>; or, <span class="accented">by a blast of burning</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fiery blast which shall destroy everything (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 Not only the setting forth Christ's kingdom in the times of the apostles, but its enlargement by gathering the dispersed Jews into the church, is foretold. Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, being planted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is the fruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, because it sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. It will be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merely called Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, and holiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. God will keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a place and a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by their unbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left, when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing which offends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyed and consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed and converted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning, quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealously affected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zeal against sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as a furnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening, and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out their lusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church, and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the glory of the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those that have it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary will seek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching, will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divine displeasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once have recourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.</body></html>
