It is one of Isaiah's favourite words. The word for "dwelling-place" is almost invariably used for the tabernacle or temple, and would seem to have that meaning here. This determines the character of the "assemblies." They are not the meetings of the people for counsel or debate, as in a Greek <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>but their "gatherings," their "solemn assemblies," in the courts of the temple. The thoughts of the prophet travel back to the history of the Exodus, when the presence of Jehovah was manifested as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm" title="And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.">Numbers 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-34.htm" title="And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.">Numbers 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm" title="And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.">Numbers 14:14</a>). In that Presence there would be safety and peace. The image is a favourite one with Isaiah, possibly as connected with the vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a>, for God's protection of His people.<p><span class= "bld">Upon all the glory shall be a defence.</span>--The phrase is almost startlingly abrupt. The thought seems to be that over the "glory" of the new Jerusalem, as just described, there shall be stretched the overarching <span class= "ital">canopy </span>of the Divine Love. The word for "defence" occurs in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm" title="Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.">Psalm 19:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-16.htm" title="Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.">Joel 2:16</a>, and is still used by Jews of the "canopy" held over bride and bridegroom at a wedding. The "baldacchino" over the altar of an Italian church probably represents the image that was present to Isaiah's mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon every dwelling-place</span> ("over the whole habitation," Revised Version). Mr. Cheyne translates "upon the whole site," and takes the "site" to be especially the temple. <span class="accented">Makon</span> seems certainly never to be used for anything but "God's dwelling-place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13, 39</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-2.htm">2 Chronicles 6:2, 30</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-68.htm">Ezra 2:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-14.htm">Psalm 33:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>). Perhaps, however, <span class="accented">every</span> dwelling-place of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every Christian Church, is intended. On these, and on all Christian assemblies, there will rest a new presence of God - one which he will have "created;" recalling that of the pillar of fire and of cloud which rested in the wilderness on the Jewish tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">A cloud and smoke by day</span>. The "pillar of the cloud" is never said in the Pentateuch to have been one of" smoke;" but Sinai "smoked" when God descended on it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>), and the psalmist speaks of a "smoke" as issuing out of God's nostrils (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>). In the poetry of Isaiah," smoke, no less than "cloud," symbolizes God's presence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon all the glory shall be a defense</span>; rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">a covering</span>. Over all the glory of Zion, its purged temple and its purified assemblies, the presence of God shall rest like a canopy, protecting it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:2-6 Not only the setting forth Christ's kingdom in the times of the apostles, but its enlargement by gathering the dispersed Jews into the church, is foretold. Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, being planted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is the fruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, because it sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. It will be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merely called Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, and holiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. God will keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a place and a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by their unbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left, when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing which offends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyed and consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed and converted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning, quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealously affected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zeal against sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as a furnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening, and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out their lusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church, and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the glory of the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those that have it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary will seek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching, will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divine displeasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once have recourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.</body></html>
