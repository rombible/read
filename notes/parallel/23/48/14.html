The latter seems to give a preferable meaning. There is, perhaps, an allusive reference to the idea implied in the name of the great king of Israel (David, "beloved," or "darling"). Cyrus was to be even as a second David, beloved of the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All ye, assemble yourselves.</span> "Once more the nations are challenged to say which of their deities has foretold the work that the Lord has willed to perform on Babylon" (Kay) (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>). If none has done so, will not Israel see and acknowledge the superiority of Jehovah to such blind deities? <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath loved him</span>. It had not been previously declared in so many words that Jehovah "loved" Cyrus; but it had been sufficiently indicated by the way in which he was spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and Isaiah 45:1-5. God "loves" all who "in an honest and good heart" seek according to their lights to do his will and serve him faithfully. Nebuchadnezzar is called his "servant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18, 20</a>), Cyrus (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>) his "anointed." It is but going one step further to call the latter his "loved one." <span class="cmt_word">He will</span> <span class="cmt_word">do his pleasure;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "God's pleasure," not his own (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His arm shall be on the Chaldeans</span>. The Hebrew is very harsh, and perhaps requires emendation; but the meaning can scarcely be other than that expressed in our version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:9-15 We have nothing ourselves to plead with God, why he should have mercy upon us. It is for his praise, to the honour of his mercy, to spare. His bringing men into trouble was to do them good. It was to refine them, but not as silver; not so thoroughly as men refine silver. If God should take that course, they are all dross, and, as such, might justly be put away. He takes them as refined in part only. Many have been brought home to God as chosen vessels, and a good work of grace begun in them, in the furnace of affliction. It is comfort to God's people, that God will secure his own honour, therefore work deliverance for them. And if God delivers his people, he cannot be at a loss for instruments to be employed. God has formed a plan, in which, for his own sake, and the glory of his grace, he saves all that come to Him.</body></html>
