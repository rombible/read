What is meant is that the things which had been from the beginning in the mind of God are now, for the first time, manifested, through the prophet, as about to pass into act. What these are the prophet develops in the following chapters, as including the spiritual redemption and restoration of Israel. They were kept in store, as it were, to make men wonder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25-26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even before the day when . . .</span>--Better, and <span class= "ital">before to-day thou heardest them not<span class= "bld">. . .</span> .</span> The reason given for what we might almost call this method of reserve and reticence, was that the people had been till now unprepared to receive the truth, and in their state it would but have increased their condemnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm" title="I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.">John 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-33.htm" title="And with many such parables spoke he the word to them, as they were able to hear it.">Mark 4:33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are created now</span>. The revelation to man of what has lain secret in God's counsels from all eternity is a sort of creation. As Nagelbach well says, it converts the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> into a <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and therefore is one step towards actual accomplishment. The mystery of "the Servant of the Lord," and of atonement and salvation through him, had hitherto been hid away - "hid in God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>), and was now for the first time to be made known to such as had "eyes to see" and "cars to hear" by the teaching of the evangelical prophet. <span class="cmt_word">Even before the day when thou heardest them not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and before to-day thou heardest them not.</span> Whatever shadows of evangelic truth are discernible in the Law and in the earlier psalms, they did not constitute a revelation of the way of salvation at all comparable to that contained in Isaiah's later chapters. <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them</span>. If the "new things" of Isaiah's prophecy had been revealed many centuries before, they would not have impressed the Jews of Isaiah's time, or even of the Captivity period, as they did by having been reserved to a comparatively late date. They would have seemed to most of them an old and trite story. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-8 The Jews valued themselves on descent from Jacob, and used the name of Jehovah as their God. They prided themselves respecting Jerusalem and the temple, yet there was no holiness in their lives. If we are not sincere in religion, we do but take the name of the Lord in vain. By prophecy they were shown how God would deal with them, long before it came to pass. God has said and done enough to prevent men's boasting of themselves, which makes the sin and ruin of the proud worse; sooner or later every mouth shall be stopped, and all become silent before Him. We are all born children of disobedience. Where original sin is, actual sin will follow. Does not the conscience of every man witness to the truth of Scripture? May the Lord prove us, and render us doers of the word.</body></html>
