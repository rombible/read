The ideal attributes of Israel, "swearing by the name of Jehovah <span class= "bld">. . .</span>" are pressed in contrast with their actual state of hypocrisy and unrighteousness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob...

"Jacob" is the natural and secular designation; "Israel" is a spiritual or covenant name (Cheyne). Both terms being appropriate to the ten tribes no less than to the two, and the present address being intended especially for the Jewish captives, a further designation is appended - <span class="cmt_word">which are come forth out of the waters of Judah</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>, "Ye that are of the fountain of Israel," marginal rendering). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> <span class="cmt_word">swear by the Name of the Lord</span>. Swearing "by the Name of the Lord" is an evidence of true religion, to a certain extent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>). It indicates that there has been, at any rate, no open apostasy. Still, it does not necessarily prove more than this; and, in the present case, it scarcely showed anything beyond mere outward formal conformity. The bulk of the captives "swore by the Name of Jehovah, and made mention of the God of Israel" (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm">Joshua 23:7</a>), but did so not in truth, nor in righteousness; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "without their state of mind or mode of action corresponding to their confession, so as to prove that it was sincerely and seriously meant" (Delitzsch). The condition of the majority of the exiles was that expressed in the words, "This people honoureth me with their lips, but in their hearts are far from me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-8 The Jews valued themselves on descent from Jacob, and used the name of Jehovah as their God. They prided themselves respecting Jerusalem and the temple, yet there was no holiness in their lives. If we are not sincere in religion, we do but take the name of the Lord in vain. By prophecy they were shown how God would deal with them, long before it came to pass. God has said and done enough to prevent men's boasting of themselves, which makes the sin and ruin of the proud worse; sooner or later every mouth shall be stopped, and all become silent before Him. We are all born children of disobedience. Where original sin is, actual sin will follow. Does not the conscience of every man witness to the truth of Scripture? May the Lord prove us, and render us doers of the word.</body></html>
