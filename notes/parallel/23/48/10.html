Commonly the refining of silver is taken as a parable of God's dealings with His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm" title="And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/22-18.htm" title="Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the middle of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.">Ezekiel 22:18-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm" title="And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.">Malachi 3:3</a>). Here the thought seems to be that the discipline had been less fierce than that of the refiner's fire. Silver was "purified seven times in the fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm" title="The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.">Psalm 12:6</a>); but that would have brought about the destruction of Israel, and He sought to spare them.<p><span class= "bld">I have chosen thee.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I have tested thee.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have refined thee, but not with silver;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but not as silver</span> (Cheyne). or, <span class="accented">but not in the manner of silver</span> (Delitzsch); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not with the severity with which silver is refined (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have</span> <span class="cmt_word">chosen thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have tested thee.</span> The furnace of affliction is here the Babylonian captivity. The object of the Captivity was to "test" and "refine," or purify God's people to a certain extent - not with extreme severity, but in such sort as to fit them to "bear his Name before the Gentiles" for another five hundred years. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:9-15 We have nothing ourselves to plead with God, why he should have mercy upon us. It is for his praise, to the honour of his mercy, to spare. His bringing men into trouble was to do them good. It was to refine them, but not as silver; not so thoroughly as men refine silver. If God should take that course, they are all dross, and, as such, might justly be put away. He takes them as refined in part only. Many have been brought home to God as chosen vessels, and a good work of grace begun in them, in the furnace of affliction. It is comfort to God's people, that God will secure his own honour, therefore work deliverance for them. And if God delivers his people, he cannot be at a loss for instruments to be employed. God has formed a plan, in which, for his own sake, and the glory of his grace, he saves all that come to Him.</body></html>
