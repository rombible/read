The question what was profitable? was one to which men returned very different answers. It was the work of the true Redeemer to lead men to the one true imperishable gain (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm" title="For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?">Matthew 16:26</a>), to lead them in the one right way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-4.htm" title="And where I go you know, and the way you know.">John 14:4-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord... which teacheth thee to profit</span>. God's teachings are all directed to the "profit" of those to whom they are addressed; and, if received in a proper spirit, actually "profit" them more than anything else can do. "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). Very profitable also are the teachings of God's providence, which chasten men, warn men, and tend to keep men in the right path. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:16-22 The Holy Spirit qualifies for service; and those may speak boldly, whom God and his Spirit send. This is to be applied to Christ. He was sent, and he had the Spirit without measure. Whom God redeems, he teaches; he teaches to profit by affliction, and then makes them partakers of his holiness. Also, by his grace he leads them in the way of duty; and by his providence he leads in the way of deliverance. God did not afflict them willingly. If their sins had not turned them away, their peace should have been always flowing and abundant. Spiritual enjoyments are ever joined with holiness of life and regard to God's will. It will make the misery of the disobedient the more painful, to think how happy they might have been. And here is assurance given of salvation out of captivity. Those whom God designs to bring home to himself, he will take care of, that they want not for their journey. This is applicable to the grace laid up for us in Jesus Christ, from whom all good flows to us, as the water to Israel out of the rock, for that Rock was Christ. The spiritual blessings of redemption, and the rescue of the church from antichristian tyranny, are here pointed to. But whatever changes take place, the Lord warned impenitent sinners that no good would come to them; that inward anguish and outward trouble, which spring from guilt and from the Divine wrath, must be their portion for ever.</body></html>
