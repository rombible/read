So Nebuchadnezzar, though his work was mainly that of a restorer, exulted in his pride in the greatness of the city of which he claimed to be the builder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm" title="The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?">Daniel 4:30</a>). So Herodotus (i. 178) describes it as the most famous and the strongest of all the cities of Assyria, adorned beyond any other city on which his eyes had ever looked. (Compare the descriptive notices in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-41.htm" title="How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!">Jeremiah 51:41</a>, and the constantly recurring epithet of "gold-abounding Babylon" in the <span class= "ital">Persians </span>of ?schylus.)<p><span class= "bld">As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</span>--The phrase had clearly become proverbial, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm" title="Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-40.htm" title="As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, said the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.">Jeremiah 50:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm" title="And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, carrying the picture of desolation to its highest point. The present state of the site of Babylon corresponds literally to the prediction. It is "a naked and hideous waste" (Layard, <span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon, </span>p. 484). The work was, however, accomplished by slow degrees, and was not, like the destruction of Nineveh, the result of a single overthrow. Darius dismantled its walls, Xerxes pulled down the Temple of Belus. Alexander contemplated its restoration, but his designs were frustrated by his early death. Susa and Ecbatana, Seleucia and Antioch, Ctesiphon and Bagdad, became successively the centres of commerce and of government. By the time of Strabo (B.C. 20) the work was accomplished, and "the vast city" had become a "vast desolation" (Strabo, xvi. 15). At no time within the range of Old Testament literature did such a consummation come within the range of the forecast which judges of the future by an induction from the past.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Babylon, the glory of kingdoms</span>. The "<span class="accented">glory"</span> of Babylon consisted: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> In her antiquity. She had been the head of a great empire long before Assyria rose to power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> In her origination of literature, architecture, and the other arts, which all passed from her to Assyria, and thence to the other nations of Asia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> In her magnificence and the magnificence of her kings, which provoked the admiration of the Assyrians themselves ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 15). As time went on, she grew in wealth and splendor. Perhaps it was granted to Isaiah to see her in ecstatic vision, not merely such as she was in the time of Sargon under Merodach-Baladan, but such as she became under Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of her kings, who raised her to the highest pitch or glory and eminence. The beauty of the Chaldees' excellency. The Kaldi appear to have been originally one of the many tribes by which Babylonia was peopled at an early date, From the expression, "Ur of the Chaldees," which occurs more than once in Genesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-28.htm">Genesis 11:28, 31</a>), we may gather that they were inhabitants of the more southern part of the country, near the coast. The same conclusion may be drawn from the Assyrian inscriptions, especially those of Shalmaneser II. - the Black Obelisk king. The term never became a general name for the Babylonian people among themselves or among the Assyrians; but, somehow-or other, it was accepted in that sense by the Jews, and is so used, not only by Isaiah, but also by the writers of Kings and Chronicles, by Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Habakkuk. <span class="cmt_word">As when God overthrew Sodom</span>. Equally sudden and complete as that destruction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:19-22 Babylon was a noble city; yet it should be wholly destroyed. None shall dwell there. It shall be a haunt for wild beasts. All this is fulfilled. The fate of this proud city is a proof of the truth of the Bible, and an emblem of the approaching ruin of the New Testament Babylon; a warning to sinners to flee from the wrath to come, and it encourages believers to expect victory over every enemy of their souls, and of the church of God. The whole world changes and is liable to decay. Wherefore let us give diligence to obtain a kingdom which cannot be moved; and in this hope let us hold fast that grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</body></html>
