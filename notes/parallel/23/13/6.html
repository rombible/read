On the "day of Jehovah," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As a destruction from the Almighty.</span>--The Hebrew <span class= "ital">shodmish-Shaddai </span>comes with the emphasis of assonance, possibly coupled with that of etymology, the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Shaddai </span>being derived by many scholars from the verb <span class= "ital">Shadad </span>=to destroy. On this assumption, <span class= "ital">"destruction from the destroyer" </span>would be a fair equivalent. The name, occurring frequently in the earlier books of the Old Testament (twenty-three times in Job and eight in the Pentateuch), was characteristic of the pre-Mosaic creed of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm" title="And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.">Exodus 6:3</a>), and occurs but seldom in the prophets: here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm" title="Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm" title="And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm" title="And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.">Ezekiel 10:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>); literally, the expression used in both passages is <span class="accented">a day of Jehovah</span>. The idiom would not, however, allow the use of the article, so that the phrase is ambiguous. "The day of Jehovah" is properly "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient" (Cheyne). But any great occasion when God passes judgment on a nation is called in Scripture "a day of the Lord." "a coming of Christ." And so here the day of the judgment upon Babylon seems to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span> Isaiah is thought to quote from Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>) here; but perhaps both prophets quoted from an earlier author. Shaddai (equivalent to "Almighty') is an ancient name of God, most rarely used by the prophetical writers (only here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>), and never elsewhere by either Isaiah or Joel. It has generally been said to mean "the Strong One;" but recently the theory has found favor that it meant originally "the Sender of storms," from the Arabic <span class="accented">sh'da - jecit</span>, <span class="accented">effudit</span>. However this may be, the word is certainly used in the later times mainly to express God's power to visit and punish, and the present passage might perhaps be best translated, "It shall come as a destruction from the Destroyer (<span class="accented">k'shod mish-Shaddai yabo</span>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:6-18 We have here the terrible desolation of Babylon by the Medes and Persians. Those who in the day of their peace were proud, and haughty, and terrible, are quite dispirited when trouble comes. Their faces shall be scorched with the flame. All comfort and hope shall fail. The stars of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall be darkened. Such expressions are often employed by the prophets, to describe the convulsions of governments. God will visit them for their iniquity, particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. There shall be a general scene of horror. Those who join themselves to Babylon, must expect to share her plagues, Re 18:4. All that men have, they would give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be the ransom of his life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus cruel and inhuman, and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And that little infants thus suffer, which shows that there is an original guilt, by which life is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day of the Lord will, indeed, be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, far beyond all here stated. Nor will there be any place for the sinner to flee to, or attempt an escape. But few act as though they believed these things.</body></html>
