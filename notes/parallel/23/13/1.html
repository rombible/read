Howl, you ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.">Isaiah 23:1</a>, indicates that we have in this division a collection of prophetic utterances, bearing upon the future of the surrounding nations, among which Babylon was naturally pre-eminent. The authenticity of the first of these oracles has been questioned, partly on the ground of differences of style, partly because it seems to anticipate the future destruction of Babylon with a distinctness which implies a prophecy after the event. The first of these objections rests, as will be seen from the numerous coincidences between these and other portions of Isaiah, on no sufficient evidence. The second implies a view of prophecy which excludes the element of a divinely given foreknowledge; and that view the present writer does not accept.<p>Accepting the two chapters as Isaiah's, we have to ask how Babylon came at the time within the prophet's historical horizon, and what were at the time its political relations with Assyria. (1) It is obvious that the negotiations which Ahaz had opened with Tiglath-pileser, the passage to and fro of armies and ambassadors, the journeys of prophets like Jonah and Nahum, the commerce of which we have traces even in the days of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a>), must have made Babylon, as well as Nineveh, familiar to the leading men of Judah. As a matter of fact, it was probably more familiar. Babylon was the older, more famous, more splendid city Nineveh (if we accept the conclusions of one school of historians) had been overpowered and destroyed by the Medes under Arbaces, and the Babylonians under Belesis (B.C. 739), the Pul of Bible history, under whom Assyria was a dependency of Babylon (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Anc. Hist., </span>p. 38). In Tiglath-pileser the Assyrians found a ruler who restored their supremacy. The Chaldaeans, however, revolted under Merodach-baladan, and Sargon records with triumph how he had conquered him and spoiled his palace. As the result of that victory, he took the title of king of Babylon. Merodach-baladan, however, renewed his resistance early in the reign of Sennacherib, and though again defeated, we find him courting the alliance of Hezekiah either before or after the destruction of that king's army (Isaiah 39). We can scarcely doubt that the thought of a Babylonian, as of an Egyptian, alliance had presented itself to the minds of the statesmen of Judah as a means of staying the progress of Assyrian conquests. The chapters now before us, however, do not seem written with reference to such an alliance, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-25.htm" title="That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.">Isaiah 14:25</a> Babylon seems contemplated chiefly as the representative of the power of Assyria. It seems probable, accordingly, that the king of Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm" title="That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!">Isaiah 14:4</a> is to be identified with Sargon, the Assyrian king, who took the title of "Vicar of the Gods in Babylon" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. xi. 17).<p>The word "burden," prefixed to this and the following prophecies, is a literal translation of the Hebrew. It seems to have acquired a half-technical sense as announcing the doom which a nation or a man was called to bear, and so to have acquired the meaning of an "oracle," or "prophecy." This meaning, which is first prominent in Isaiah (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm" title="The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal,">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm" title="The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.">Proverbs 31:1</a> it is used of an ethical or didactic utterance thought of as inspired), was afterwards given to it in the speeches of the false prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm" title="Your prophets have seen vain and foolish things for you: and they have not discovered your iniquity, to turn away your captivity; but have seen for you false burdens and causes of banishment.">Lamentations 2:14</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-33.htm" title="And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:33-40</a> we have a striking play upon the primary and derived meaning of the word. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-33.htm" title="And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:33</a>.) It continued in use, however, in spite of Jeremiah's protest, and appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.">Zechariah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, said the LORD, which stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-1.htm" title="The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.">Malachi 1:1</a>. <span class= "ital">Oracle </span>is perhaps the best English equivalent.
