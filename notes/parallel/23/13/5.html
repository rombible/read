And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.">Isaiah 39:3</a> of Babylon itself in relation to Jerusalem. The "end of heaven" represents the thoughts of Isaiah's time, the earth as an extended plain, and the skies rising like a great vault above. The phrase represents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-32.htm" title="For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?">Deuteronomy 4:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm" title="His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.">Psalm 19:6</a>), as it were, the <span class= "ital">ultima Thule </span>of discovery. For the "whole land," the Hebrew noun hovers, as often elsewhere, between the meanings of "earth," or "country." The LXX. favours the former meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They come from a far country</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>). Both Media and Persia were "far countries" to the Hebrews, Persia especially. There is no indication that they knew of any countries more remote towards the East. Hence the expression which follows, "from the end of heaven" - the heaven being supposed to end where the earth ended. Isaiah, like the other sacred writers, conforms his language on cosmical subjects to the opinions of his day. Even the Lord. With a most effective anthropomorphism, Jehovah is made to march with the army that he has mustered (ver. 4) against the land that has provoked his wrath - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">The weapons</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:25; 51:20). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy the whole land.</span> Many critics would render <span class="accented">ha-arets</span> by "the earth" here. It may be granted that the language of the prophecy goes beyond the occasion in places (especially vers. 11 and 13), and passes from Babylon to that wicked world of which Babylon is a type; but, where the context permits, it seems better to restrict than to expand the meaning of the words employed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-5 The threatenings of God's word press heavily upon the wicked, and are a sore burden, too heavy for them to bear. The persons brought together to lay Babylon waste, are called God's sanctified or appointed ones; designed for this service, and made able to do it. They are called God's mighty ones, because they had their might from God, and were now to use it for him. They come from afar. God can make those a scourge and ruin to his enemies, who are farthest off, and therefore least dreaded.</body></html>
