neither shall it be dwelled in from generation to generation.">Jeremiah 50:39</a>), or, possibly, the hyaena.

The Authorised version is either an attempt to combine the two meanings, or to take the word "widow" figuratively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-8.htm" title="Therefore hear now this, you that are given to pleasures, that dwell carelessly, that say in your heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:">Isaiah 47:8</a>, for a house bereaved of its owner.<p><span class= "bld">Dragons in their pleasant palaces.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">jackals </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm" title="And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-37.htm" title="And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.">Jeremiah 51:37</a>, and elsewhere) <span class= "ital">in their palaces of pleasure.</span><p><span class= "bld">Her time.</span>--The appointed day of visitation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-21.htm" title="Also her hired men are in the middle of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come on them, and the time of their visitation.">Jeremiah 46:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-27.htm" title="Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.">Jeremiah 50:27</a>).<p>The whole passage finds a singular parallel in an inscription of Assurbanipal's recording his devastation of the fields of Elam: "Wild asses, serpents, beasts of the desert and <span class= "ital">galhus </span>(bull-shaped demons), safely I caused to lie down in them" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, i.</span>, p. 80).

The doom that Babylon had inflicted on others was to come upon herself. The language of modern travellers illustrates the fulfilment of the prediction. "Owls start from the scanty thickets, and the foul jackal stalks among the furrows" (Layard, <span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon, </span>p. 484, quoted by Kay).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wild beasts of the islands</span>.

The Revised Version gives "wolves." <span class="cmt_word">In their desolate houses</span>; or, <span class="accented">in their castles</span> (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And dragons</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "serpents." These have not been observed recently; but one of our old travelers notes that "the lande of Baby-lone," in his day, "was fulle of dragons and grote serpentes, and dyverse other veney-mouse ecstes alle abouten" (Mandeville, quoted by Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 36). <span class="cmt_word">Near to come</span>. About one hundred and eighty years elapsed between the utterance of this prophecy and the fall of Babylon - a short period in the lifetime of a nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:19-22 Babylon was a noble city; yet it should be wholly destroyed. None shall dwell there. It shall be a haunt for wild beasts. All this is fulfilled. The fate of this proud city is a proof of the truth of the Bible, and an emblem of the approaching ruin of the New Testament Babylon; a warning to sinners to flee from the wrath to come, and it encourages believers to expect victory over every enemy of their souls, and of the church of God. The whole world changes and is liable to decay. Wherefore let us give diligence to obtain a kingdom which cannot be moved; and in this hope let us hold fast that grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</body></html>
