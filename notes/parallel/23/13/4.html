(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise of a multitude in the mountains</span>. I do not know why Isaiah should not have been "thinking of his geography" (Cheyne). As soon as the Greeks knew anything of the Persians, they knew of them as a <span class="accented">mountain</span> people, and attributed their valor and their handy habits to the physical character of their country (Herod., 9. <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.). Jeremiah connects the invading army which destroyed Babylon with mountains, when he derives it from. Ararat (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>), Minni (Armenia), and Ashchenaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>). At any rate, the mention of "mountains" here is very appropriate, both Media and Persia being, in the main, mountainous countries. <span class="cmt_word">A great people</span>; or, <span class="accented">much people</span> - not necessarily of one nation only.

The persons brought together to lay Babylon waste, are called God's sanctified or appointed ones; designed for this service, and made able to do it. They are called God's mighty ones, because they had their might from God, and were now to use it for him. They come from afar. God can make those a scourge and ruin to his enemies, who are farthest off, and therefore least dreaded.</body></html>
