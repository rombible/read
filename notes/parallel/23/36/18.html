Sennacherib claims to be entitled to the people's allegiance, and represents Hezekiah as a rebel, who seeks to draw them away from their duty. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land? The successes of the Assyrians, and the religious character of their wars, justified this boast. The pervading idea of the inscriptions is that wars arc undertaken for the glory of the Assyrian deities, particularly of Asshur, for the chastisement of his enemies, and with the object of establishing in each country, as it is brought under subjection, the laws and worship of Asshur (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 322-324 and 531). The nations fight under the protection of their own gods, and thus each war is a struggle between the Assyrian deities and those of the nation with which they arc contending. Hitherto, undoubtedly, Assyria had met with almost uniform success (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-22:See 2Ki 18:17-37, and the commentary thereon.</body></html>
