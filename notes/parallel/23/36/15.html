In contrast with what he derides as trust in a God who was against those who trusted Him, he offers tangible material advantages They have only to leave the besieged city, and to go to the Assyrian camp, and they will be allowed provisionally to occupy their own houses and till their own fields, and, instead of dying of thirst, shall have each man the waters of his own cistern; and then, not without a latent sarcasm, worse than the <span class= "ital">v? victis </span>which is the normal utterance of conquerors, he offers the doom of exile as if it were a change for the better, and not the worse, as though the conquered had no love of country as such, no reverence for the sepulchres of their fathers, no yearning for the Temple of their God. The taunt and the promise may, perhaps, be connected with Sennacherib's boast that he had improved the water-supply of the cities of his empire (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 32, 9:23, 26, 28).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah</span>. There is nothing improbable in Rabshakeh's having thus spoken.

Hezekiah would naturally repeat these premises to the people, and could not give their effect in simpler words than by saying, "Jehovah will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria." Spies and deserters would naturally tell the Assyrian envoys what he had said. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-22:See 2Ki 18:17-37, and the commentary thereon.</body></html>
