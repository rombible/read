The inscriptions of Sennacherib fix the date of his campaign against Hezekiah in the third year of his reign (B.C. 700), and that coincides not with the fourteenth, but with the twenty-seventh year of the king of Judah. The error, on this assumption, arose from the editor of Isaiah's prophecies taking for granted that the illness of Hezekiah followed on the destruction of Sennacherib's army, or, at least, on his attack, and then reckoning back the fifteen years for which his life was prolonged from the date of his death. Most of the scholars named above have come to the conclusion that the illness preceded Sennacherib's campaign by ten or eleven years, and this, of course, involves throwing back the embassy from Babylon (Isaiah 39) <span class= "ital">to </span>about the same period. Lenormant (<span class= "ital">Manual of Ancient History, </span>1:181) keeping to the Biblical sequence, real or apparent, of the events, meets the difficulty by assuming that Hezekiah reigned for forty-one instead of twenty-nine years, and that Manasseh was associated with him in titular sovereignty even from his birth, and the fifty years of his reign reckoned from that epoch.<p><span class= "bld">Sennacherib king of Assyria.</span>--According to the Assyrian inscriptions, the king succeeded Sargon, who was assassinated in his palace, B.C. 704, and after subduing the province of Babylon which had rebelled under Merodach-baladan, turned his course southward against Hezekiah with four or five distinct complaints--(1) that the king had refused tribute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.">2Kings 18:14</a>); (2) that he had opened negotiations with Babylon and Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-24.htm" title="How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?">2Kings 18:24</a>) with a view to an alliance against Assyria; (3) that he had helped the Philistines of Ekron to rise against their king who supported Assyria. and had kept that king as a prisoner in Jerusalem (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, i.</span> 36-39).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah</span>. There is an irreconcilable difference between this note of time, in the passage as it stands, and the Assyrian inscriptions. The fourteenth year of Hezekiah was <span class="date">B.C. 714</span> or 713. Sargon was then King of Assyria, and continued king till <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>. Sennacherib did not ascend the throne till that year, and he did not lead an expedition into Palestine till <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. Thus the date, as it stands, is cloven or twelve years too early. It is now the common opinion of critics that the chronology of the Books of Kings, speaking generally, is "a later addition to the Hebrew narrative" (Cheyne, 'Isaiah,' vol. 1. p. 199, note 1). It is uncertain when the dates were added; but it would not be long from the time when the addition was made before "<span class="accented">Isaiah"</span> would be brought into accord with "Kings." Another view is that the date belongs to the original writings, but that it has suffered corruption, "fourteenth" having been substituted for "twenty-sixth," from an overstrict rendering of the expression, "in those days," which introduces the narrative of ch. 38. That narrative undoubtedly belongs to Hezekiah's fourteenth year. A third view is that of Dr. Hincks, who suggests a derangement of the text, which has attached to an expedition of Sennacherib a date originally belonging to an attack by Sargon. He supposes the original text to have run thus: "And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that the King of Assyria came up (against him). In those days was King Hezekiah sick unto death, etc. (ch. 38, 39.). And Sennacherib, King of Assyria, came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them," etc. (ch. 36, 37.). The subject has been treated at considerable length by Mr. Cheyne ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 1. pp. 196-204), who has accidentally ascribed to Sir H. Rawlinson the second of the above theories, which really originated with the present writer. <span class="cmt_word">Sennacherib, King of Assyria</span>. The Hebrew rendering of the name is <span class="accented">Sankherib</span>, the Greek <span class="accented">Sanacharibus</span> or <span class="accented">Senacheribus.</span> In the Assyrian the literation is <span class="accented">Sin-akhi-irib -</span> and the meaning" Sin (the moon-god) multiplies brothers." Sin-akhi-irib was the son and successor of Sargon. His father was murdered, and he ascended the throne in <span class="date">B.C. 705</span> (G. Smith, 'Epunym Canon,' p. 67). <span class="cmt_word">Came up against all the defenced cities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the fenced cities</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>,or "all the <span class="accented">fortified</span> cities" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And took them</span>. Sennacberib tells us that, in the campaign of his fourth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), he "captured forty-six of the strong cities" belonging to Hezekiah, King of Judah, while of the "fortresses and small cities" he took "a countless number" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134).
