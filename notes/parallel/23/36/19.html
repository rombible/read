Sargon had reduced Hamath in his third year, <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>. He had "swept the whole land of Hamath to its extreme limit," taken the king prisoner, and carried him away captive to Assyria, where he flayed and burned him; removed most of the inhabitants, and replaced them by Assyrians; plundered the city of its chief treasures, and placed an Assyrian governor over it (see 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Among the treasures taken were, no doubt, the images of the Hamathite gods, which were uniformly carried off by the Assyrians from a conquered city. <span class="cmt_word">And Arphad</span>. Arphad, or Arpad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>), had joined with Hamath in the war against Assyria, and was taken by Sargon in the same year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Of Sepharvaim. Scpharvaim, or Sippara, was besieged and captured by Sargon in his twelfth year, <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>. A severe example was made of the inhabitants (G. Smith, 'History of Babylonia,' p. 122). A discovery made by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, in 1881, is thought to prove that Sippara was situated at Abu-Habbah, between Baghdad and the site of Babylon, about sixteen miles from the former city (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 8. pp. 164, 173). "Hena" and "Ivah," joined with Sepharvaim by the author of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>), seem to be omitted by Isaiah as unimportant. They are thought to have been towns upon the Euphrates, not very distant from Babylon, and have been identified respectively with Anah and Hit. But the identification is in both cases uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Have they delivered Samaria?</span> Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "<span class="accented">How</span> <span class="accented">much less</span> have they delivered Samaria?" Kay, "<span class="accented">Verily have they</span> delivered," regarding the sentence as ironical. Sennacherib can see no distinction between the cities where Jehovah was worshipped, and those which acknowledged any other tutelary god.
