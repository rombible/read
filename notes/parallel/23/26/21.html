The prophet has in his thoughts the reckless destruction of life which characterised the great world-powers of Assyria and Babylon. As in the case of Abel's blood that cried from the ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-16.htm" title="And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelled in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.">Genesis 4:16</a>), so here the earth first brings to light the blood of those that have been slain, and then the forms of the murdered ones themselves.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord cometh out of his place</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>). In the Psalms God is represented as "bowing the heavens and coming down," bringing them, as it were, with him. Here (and in Micah) he quits his place in heaven, as a king quits his own country when he proceeds to take vengeance on rebels in another. The expressions are, both of them, accommodations to human modes of thought. <span class="cmt_word">To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The earth also shall disclose her blood</span>; literally, <span class="accented">her bloods</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her bloodsheddings; the many murders committed by man upon her surface. Isaiah denounced "murderers" in his first chapter (ver. 27). Manasseh's murders were the main cause of the first destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>). The second destruction was equally a judgment for the innocent blood that had been shed upon the earth, "from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Bars-chins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>). Bloodshed "cries to God for vengeance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>), and will be one of the main causes of the world's final destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And shall no more cover her slain</span>. "There is nothing covered that shall not" in the last day "be revealed, and hid that shall not be known" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>). Every murder, however secret, will be brought to light, and every murderer, however unsuspected previously, denounced and punished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:20,21 When dangers threaten, it is good to retire and lie hid; when we commend ourselves to God to hide us, he will hide us either under heaven or in heaven. Thus we shall be safe and happy in the midst of tribulations. It is but for a short time, as it were for a little moment; when over, it will seem as nothing. God's place is the mercy-seat; there he delights to be: when he punishes, he comes out of his place, for he has no pleasure in the death of sinners. But there is hardly any truth more frequently repeated in Scripture, than God's determined purpose to punish the workers of iniquity. Let us keep close to the Lord, and separate from the world; and let us seek comfort in secret prayer. A day of vengeance is coming on the world, and before it comes we are to expect tribulation and suffering. But because the Christian looks for these things, shall he be restless and dismayed? No, let him repose himself in his God. Abiding in him, the believer is safe. And let us wait patiently the fulfilling of God's promises.</body></html>
