His people also need the preparation of silent and solitary prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-6.htm" title="But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.">Matthew 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm" title="For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up on a rock.">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD: for he has showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong city.">Psalm 31:21</a>).

As when a storm comes, prudence counsels men to seek shelter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-19.htm">Exodus 9:19</a>), so now the prophet advises his people to put themselves under cover during the coming tempest. His meaning, probably, is that they should retire into the privacy of communion with God, withdrawing from public affairs and the distractions of a worldly life. <span class="cmt_word">Shut thy doors about thee</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For a little moment</span> (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>; and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7, 8</a>).

Thus we shall be safe and happy in the midst of tribulations. It is but for a short time, as it were for a little moment; when over, it will seem as nothing. God's place is the mercy-seat; there he delights to be: when he punishes, he comes out of his place, for he has no pleasure in the death of sinners. But there is hardly any truth more frequently repeated in Scripture, than God's determined purpose to punish the workers of iniquity. Let us keep close to the Lord, and separate from the world; and let us seek comfort in secret prayer. A day of vengeance is coming on the world, and before it comes we are to expect tribulation and suffering. But because the Christian looks for these things, shall he be restless and dismayed? No, let him repose himself in his God. Abiding in him, the believer is safe. And let us wait patiently the fulfilling of God's promises.</body></html>
