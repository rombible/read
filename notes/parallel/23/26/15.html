The LXX., however, gives, "Add thou evils to all the glorious ones," as if referring to the "chastening" of exile in the next verse, and the use of the word "nation" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>heathen) instead of "people," is, perhaps, in favour of this rendering. "Nation," however, is used for Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm" title="You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before you according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.">Isaiah 9:3</a>, which is partly parallel to this passage.<p><span class= "bld">Thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earths</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Thou hast moved far off the borders of the land. </span>The English Version seems to speak of the exile and dispersion of the people. "What is really meant is, probably, that Jehovah will restore it to its old remoter boundaries, as in the days of David and Solomon. This belongs, of course, to the ideal, and not the historical, restoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast increased the nation</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "righteous nation" of ver. 2 - not the Jewish people merely, but "the Israel of God" - who are to be "a great multitude, that no man can number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hadst removed it.</span> This rendering gives a very good sense. It makes the redeemed pass in thought from their present state of happiness and glory to that former time of tribulation and affliction when they were a remnant, scattered over the face of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13-15</a>), driven into its uttermost corners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>), oppressed and down-trodden by their enemies. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear the rendering. Most modern commentators translate, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> hast extended far all the borders of the land," which is certainly the more natural meaning of the words. If we accept this view, we must regard the clause as continuing the idea contained in the former part of the verse - the nation is increased in number, and its borders are advanced - it is "a multitude that no man can <span class="accented">number</span>," and it has no narrower limits than the "<span class="accented">new</span> earth," which has been given to it for its habitation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:12-19 Every creature, every business, any way serviceable to our comfort, God makes to be so; he makes that work for us which seemed to make against us. They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by the Divine grace they were taught to look to be set free from all former masters. The cause opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last. See our need of afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now they pour it out, it comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bring us to secret prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing his church. His resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all the deliverance foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain, which causes the herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his church from the lowest state. But we may refer to the resurrection of the dead, especially of those united to Christ.</body></html>
