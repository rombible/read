Better, <span class= "ital">is straight, </span>or is <span class= "ital">even</span>--i.e., leads on without interruption to its appointed end. So, in the second clause, instead of "thou shalt weigh the path," which conveys a not very intelligible thought, we render, <span class= "ital">makest smooth the path. </span>Probably, too, the word translated, "most upright," as if it were a vocative, should be taken adverbially. The verse is, as it were, an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm" title="Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.">Proverbs 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-6.htm" title="Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that you can not know them.">Proverbs 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-21.htm" title="For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his goings.">Proverbs 5:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of the just is uprightness</span>; or, <span class="accented">the path for the just is straight</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is one of the main blessings of the righteous that God "makes their way straight before their face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), "leads them in a plain path" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>), "shows them the way they are to walk in" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>), so that they are for the most part free from doubt and perplexity as to the line of conduct which it behooves them to, pursue. If this is so in the present life, still more will it be the uniform condition of the just in another sphere. Then God will of a surety "direct <span class="accented">all</span> their paths" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou, most upright, dost weigh</span>; literally, O <span class="accented">upright One</span>, <span class="accented">thou dost weigh</span>. The term "upright" is applied to God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92.htm">Psalm 92</a>:16. By "weighing the path of the just" is meant keeping it, as Justice keeps her scales, straight and level. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:5-11 The way of the just is evenness, a steady course of obedience and holy conversation. And it is their happiness that God makes their way plain and easy. It is our duty, and will be our comfort, to wait for God, to keep up holy desires toward him in the darkest and most discouraging times. Our troubles must never turn us from God; and in the darkest, longest night of affliction, with our souls must we desire him; and this we must wait and pray to him for. We make nothing of our religion, whatever our profession may be, if we do not make heart-work of it. Though we come ever so early, we shall find God ready to receive us. The intention of afflictions is to teach righteousness: blessed is the man whom the Lord thus teaches. But sinners walk contrary to him. They will go on in their evil ways, because they will not consider what a God he is whose laws they persist in despising. Scorners and the secure will shortly feel, what now they will not believe, that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. They will not see the evil of sin; but they shall see. Oh that they would abandon their sins, and turn to the Lord, that he may have mercy upon them.</body></html>
