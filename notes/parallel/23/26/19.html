as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.">2Samuel 23:4</a>) revive the dying energies of His people. Most interpreters, however, render the words <span class= "ital">the dew of lights </span>(plural expressing completeness), the dew which is born of the womb of the morning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm" title="Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.">Psalm 110:3</a>). This, coming as it does from the "Father of Lights" (so the LXX., "The dew that is from Thee shall be healing for them"), shall have power to make the earth cast forth even the shadowy forms of the dead. The verb for "cast forth" is another form of that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm" title="We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.">Isaiah 26:18</a> of childbirth, and is, in this interpretation, used in the same sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-21.</span> - THE PROPHET'S COMMENT ON THE SONG OF THE JUST. Having concluded his "<span class="accented">song</span> of the just" in a minor key with a confession of human weakness, the prophet proceeds to cheer and encourage his disciples by a clear and positive declaration of the doctrine of the resurrection: "Thy dead, O Israel, shall live." He then adds a recommendation for the present - a recommendation to privacy and retirement, until the judgments of God which he has predicted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>.) are shown forth upon the earth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy dead men shall live</span>. A universal resurrection of" some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>), is not yet announced; but only a resurrection of the just, perhaps only of the just Israelites. The object is encouragement, especially encouragement of those whom the prophet directly addresses - the religious Israelites of his own day. It is enough for them at the present time to know that, whether the day of the Lord comes in their time or no, when it <span class="accented">comes</span>, they will have a part in it. The assurance is given, and is made doubly sure by repetition. The prophet does not say, Together with <span class="cmt_word">my dead body</span> they will arise; for there is nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to "together," and the ellipse of '<span class="accented">ira</span>, "<span class="accented">with</span>," though suggested by Kimchi, is impossible; nor is it likely that he intends to speak of his own dead body at all. He may, perhaps, call the past generations of just Israelites "my dead," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dead with whom he is in sympathy; or the supposed personal suffix may be merely paragogic, as Rosenm&uuml;ller argues. In any case the two clauses must be regarded as identical in meaning - an instance of "synonymous parallelism.... Thy dead men shall live; my dead shall arise." <span class="cmt_word">Awake and sing</span>; rather, <span class="accented">awake and shout for joy</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-27.htm">Psalm 35:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-4.htm">Psalm 67:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye that dwell in dust</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, "Many <span class="accented">that sleep in the dust of the earth</span> shall awake"). <span class="cmt_word">Thy dew is as the dew of herbs</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refreshing, vivifying, potent to make even dead bones live. "Thy dew" may be said with reference to Jehovah, for changes in the person addressed are frequent in Isaiah; or with reference to the people of Israel, meaning, "the dew which Jehovah will shed on thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on thy dead. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:12-19 Every creature, every business, any way serviceable to our comfort, God makes to be so; he makes that work for us which seemed to make against us. They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by the Divine grace they were taught to look to be set free from all former masters. The cause opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last. See our need of afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now they pour it out, it comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bring us to secret prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing his church. His resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all the deliverance foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain, which causes the herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his church from the lowest state. But we may refer to the resurrection of the dead, especially of those united to Christ.</body></html>
