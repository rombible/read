From exhorting the messengers to hasten on their errand, Isaiah turns to the nations generally, and bids them attend to a coming signal - an ensign is about to be raised, a trumpet is about to be sounded - let them gaze and hearken; the result will be well worth noting. The imagery is not to be taken literally, but in the same way as the notices in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">When he lifteth up an ensign... when he bloweth a trumpet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when an ensign is lifted</span> up... <span class="accented">when a trumpet sounds</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>On the mountains</span>. Wherever the great event took place, the signal for it was given on the mountains of Judea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-34</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-7 God's care for his people; and the increase of the church. - This chapter is one of the most obscure in Scripture, though more of it probably was understood by those for whose use it was first intended, than by us now. Swift messengers are sent by water to a nation marked by Providence, and measured out, trodden under foot. God's people are trampled on; but whoever thinks to swallow them up, finds they are cast down, yet not deserted, not destroyed. All the dwellers on earth must watch the motions of the Divine Providence, and wait upon the directions of the Divine will. God gives assurance to his prophet, and by him to be given to his people. Zion is his rest for ever, and he will look after it. He will suit to their case the comforts and refreshments he provides for them; they will be acceptable, because seasonable. He will reckon with his and their enemies; and as God's people are protected at all seasons of the year, so their enemies are exposed at all seasons. A tribute of praise should be brought to God from all this. What is offered to God, must be offered in the way he has appointed; and we may expect him to meet us where he records his name. Thus shall the nations of the earth be convinced that Jehovah is the God, and Israel is his people, and shall unite in presenting spiritual sacrifices to his glory. Happy are those who take warning by his judgment on others, and hasten to join him and his people. Whatever land or people may be intended, we are here taught not to think that God takes no care of his church, and has no respect to the affairs of men, because he permits the wicked to triumph for a season. He has wise reasons for so doing, which we cannot now understand, but which will appear at the great day of his coming, when he will bring every work into judgment, and reward every man according to his works.</body></html>
