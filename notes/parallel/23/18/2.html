Instead of "scattered and peeled, "we are to read <span class= "ital">tall and polished, </span>as describing the <span class= "ital">physique </span>which had probably impressed itself on Isaiah's mind. (Comp. the Sabeans as "men of stature" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be yours: they shall come after you; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to you, they shall make supplication to you, saying, Surely God is in you; and there is none else, there is no God.">Isaiah 45:14</a>.) They were terrible then, as they had ever been (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>imperious and mighty), a nation <span class= "ital">that treadeth down </span>its foes. Instead of "meted out and trodden down," they are a nation of <span class= "ital">command, command </span>(or, perhaps, "strength, strength"). The rivers are literally the affluents of the Nile that <span class= "ital">intersect </span>and fertilise (not "spoil") the hills and valleys of Nubia. Some commentators, however, though with less probability, accept the Authorised version, and refer the words to Israel, as "scattered and plundered," with its land "spoiled" by the "rivers of invading armies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That sendeth ambassadors</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">messengers</span>, as the word is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-9.htm">Isaiah 57:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>. They are sent, apparently, by the king to his own people. <span class="cmt_word">By the sea</span>. "The sea" must in this place necessarily mean the Nile, which is called "the sea" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a> certainly, and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>. Vessels of papyrus could not possibly have been employed in the very difficult navigation of the Red Sea. <span class="cmt_word">Vessels of bulrushes</span>. That some of the boats used upon the Nile were constructed of the papyrus (which is a sort of bulrush) we learn from Herodotus (it. 96), Theophrastus ('Hist. Plant.,' 4:9), Plutarch ('De Isid. et Osir.,' &sect; 18), Pliny (Hist. 'Nat.,' 6:22), and Lucan ('Pharsal.,' 4:136). They are represented occasionally on the Egyptian monuments. <span class="accented">Saying</span>. This word is interpolated by our translators, and gives a wrong sense. It is the prophet that addresses the messengers, not the king who sends them. <span class="cmt_word">To a nation scattered and peeled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">tall and polished</span>, or <span class="accented">tall and sleek</span>. The word translated "scattered" means properly "drawn out," and seems to be applied here to the physique of the Ethiopians, whose stature is said to have been remarkable (Herod., 3:20, 114). The other epithet refers to the glossy skin of the people. <span class="cmt_word">A people terrible from their beginning hitherto</span>; The Israelites first knew the Ethiopians as soldiers when they formed a part of the army brought by Shishak (Sheshonk I.) against Rehoboam, about <span class="date">B.C. 970</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>). They had afterwards experience of their vast numbers, when Zerah made his attack upon Asa; but on this occasion they succeeded in defeating them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-13</a>). It was not till about two centuries after this that the power of Ethiopia began to be really formidable to Egypt; and the "miserable Cushites," as they had been in the habit of calling them, acquired the preponderating influence in the valley of the Nile, and under Piankhi, Shabak, Shabatek, and Tirhakah (Tahark), reduced Egypt to subjection. Isaiah, perhaps, refers to their rise under Piankhi as "their beginning." <span class="cmt_word">A nation meted out and trodden down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a nation of meting out and trampling</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one accustomed to mete out its neighbors' bounds with a measuring-line, and to trample other nations under its feet. <span class="cmt_word">Whose land the rivers have spoiled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whose land rivers despoil</span>. The deposit of mud, which fertilizes Egypt, is washed by the rivers from Ethiopia, which is thus continually losing large quantities of rich son. This fact was well known to the Greeks (Herod., 2:12, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.), and there is no reason why Isaiah should not have been acquainted with it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-7 God's care for his people; and the increase of the church. - This chapter is one of the most obscure in Scripture, though more of it probably was understood by those for whose use it was first intended, than by us now. Swift messengers are sent by water to a nation marked by Providence, and measured out, trodden under foot. God's people are trampled on; but whoever thinks to swallow them up, finds they are cast down, yet not deserted, not destroyed. All the dwellers on earth must watch the motions of the Divine Providence, and wait upon the directions of the Divine will. God gives assurance to his prophet, and by him to be given to his people. Zion is his rest for ever, and he will look after it. He will suit to their case the comforts and refreshments he provides for them; they will be acceptable, because seasonable. He will reckon with his and their enemies; and as God's people are protected at all seasons of the year, so their enemies are exposed at all seasons. A tribute of praise should be brought to God from all this. What is offered to God, must be offered in the way he has appointed; and we may expect him to meet us where he records his name. Thus shall the nations of the earth be convinced that Jehovah is the God, and Israel is his people, and shall unite in presenting spiritual sacrifices to his glory. Happy are those who take warning by his judgment on others, and hasten to join him and his people. Whatever land or people may be intended, we are here taught not to think that God takes no care of his church, and has no respect to the affairs of men, because he permits the wicked to triumph for a season. He has wise reasons for so doing, which we cannot now understand, but which will appear at the great day of his coming, when he will bring every work into judgment, and reward every man according to his works.</body></html>
