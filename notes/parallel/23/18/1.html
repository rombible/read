The movements of Tirhakah, king of Cush or Ethiopia, from the upper valley of the Nile, subduing Egypt, and prepared to enter into conflict with the great Assyrian king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-9.htm" title="And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,">Isaiah 37:9</a>), had apparently excited the hopes of such of Hezekiah's counsellors as put their trust in an arm of flesh. To these Isaiah now turns with words of warning. The words "shadowing with wings" have been very variously interpreted as implying (1) the image of a mighty eagle stretching out its imperial wings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-1.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 17:1-8</a>); (2) the <span class= "ital">ur?us </span>or disk with outspread wings which appears in Egyptian paintings as the symbol of Ethiopian sovereignty; (3) the rendering <span class= "ital">resounding </span>being adopted instead of "shadowing," the swarms of the <span class= "ital">tse-tse </span>fly that have been the terror of all travellers in Abyssinia. Of these (2) has most to commend it, and receives confirmation from the inscription of Piankhi-Mer-Amon, translated by Canon Cook in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past </span>(2 p. 89), in which that king, an Ethiopian, who had conquered Egypt, appears with the <span class= "ital">ur?us </span>on his head, and the chiefs of the north and south cry out to him, "Grant us to be under thy shadow." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/30-2.htm" title="That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!">Isaiah 30:2-3</a>.) The phrase, "beyond the river," points, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a>, to the region of the White and the Blue Nile, south of Meroe or <span class= "ital">Sennar, </span>and not far from the Lake Nyanza of modern explorers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - THE HOMAGE OF ETHIOPIA TO JEHOVAH. Amid the general excitement caused by the advance of Assyria, Ethiopia also is stirred, and stirred to its furthest limits. The king sends messengers in beats upon the canals and rivers to summon his troops to his standard (vers. 1, 2). The earth stands agaze to see the result of the approaching collision (ver. 3); but God rests calmly in heaven while events are ripening (vers. 4, 5). When the time comes he will strike the blow - Assyria will be given to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field (ver. 6). Then Ethiopia will make an act of homage to Jehovah by the sending of a present to Jerusalem (ver. 7). The time seems to be that immediately preceding the great invasion of Sennacherib (about <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>), when Shabatok the Ethiopian was King of Egypt, and Tirhakah (Tahark) either Crown Prince under him, or more probably Lord Paramount of Egypt over him, and reigning at Napata. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Ho</span> <span class="accented">for the land!</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shadowing with wings</span>; literally, either <span class="accented">the land of the shadow of wings</span> or <span class="accented">the land of the noise of wings</span>, most probably the latter. Allusion is thought to be made to the swarms of buzzing flies, especially the tsetse, with which Ethiopia abounds. At the same time, these swarms are, perhaps, intended to be taken as emblems of the hosts of warriors which Ethiopia can send forth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia</span>. The prophet cannot be supposed to have had more than a vague knowledge of African geography. He seems, however, robe aware that Ethiopia is a land of many rivers (see Baker's 'Nile Tributaries'), and he assumes that the dominion of the Ethiopian kings extends even beyond these rivers to the south of them. His object is, as Mr. Cheyne says, "to emphasize the greatness of Ethiopia." It may be questioned, however, whether the dominion of the Ethiopian kings of the time extended so far as he supposed. The seat of their power was Napata, now <span class="accented">Gebel Berkal</span>, in the great bend of the Nile between lat. 18&deg; and 19&deg; N.; and its southern limit was probably Khar-toum and the line of the Blue Nile (see Rawlinson's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 436). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-7 God's care for his people; and the increase of the church. - This chapter is one of the most obscure in Scripture, though more of it probably was understood by those for whose use it was first intended, than by us now. Swift messengers are sent by water to a nation marked by Providence, and measured out, trodden under foot. God's people are trampled on; but whoever thinks to swallow them up, finds they are cast down, yet not deserted, not destroyed. All the dwellers on earth must watch the motions of the Divine Providence, and wait upon the directions of the Divine will. God gives assurance to his prophet, and by him to be given to his people. Zion is his rest for ever, and he will look after it. He will suit to their case the comforts and refreshments he provides for them; they will be acceptable, because seasonable. He will reckon with his and their enemies; and as God's people are protected at all seasons of the year, so their enemies are exposed at all seasons. A tribute of praise should be brought to God from all this. What is offered to God, must be offered in the way he has appointed; and we may expect him to meet us where he records his name. Thus shall the nations of the earth be convinced that Jehovah is the God, and Israel is his people, and shall unite in presenting spiritual sacrifices to his glory. Happy are those who take warning by his judgment on others, and hasten to join him and his people. Whatever land or people may be intended, we are here taught not to think that God takes no care of his church, and has no respect to the affairs of men, because he permits the wicked to triumph for a season. He has wise reasons for so doing, which we cannot now understand, but which will appear at the great day of his coming, when he will bring every work into judgment, and reward every man according to his works.</body></html>
