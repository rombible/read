Even that may perish, but not so His pitying affection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Can a woman forget?.... yea,</span> they may forget. In the siege of Samaria by Benhadad, King of Syria, a mother, we are told (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28, 29</a>), boiled her son for food. In the last siege of Jerusalem similar horrors are reported (Joseph., 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:03, 4). Mothers have even been known in England who have forced their tender and innocent daughters to commit deadly sin. <span class="cmt_word">Yet will I</span> <span class="cmt_word">not forget,</span> The love of God surpasses that of either father or mother. "When my father and my mother forsake me," says David, "then the Lord will take me up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>). "God is love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>) in his very essence; and his infinite love is deeper, tenderer, truer, than finite love can ever be. Still, that which is nearest to it upon earth is, doubtless, the love of a mother for her children (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-13.htm">Isaiah 66:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:13-17 Let there be universal joy, for God will have mercy upon the afflicted, because of his compassion; upon his afflicted, because of his covenant. We have no more reason to question his promise and grace, than we have to question his providence and justice. Be assured that God has a tender affection for his church and people; he would not have them to be discouraged. Some mothers do neglect their children; but God's compassions to his people, infinitely exceed those of the tenderest parents toward their children. His setting them as a mark on his hand, or a seal upon his arm, denotes his being ever mindful of them. As far as we have scriptural evidence that we belong to his ransomed flock, we may be sure that he will never forsake us. Let us then give diligence to make our calling and election sure, and rejoice in the hope and glory of God.</body></html>
