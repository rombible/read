for "yet" read <span class= "ital">and. </span>The Servant falls back upon the greatness of the work committed to him, that of restoring Israel, and is certain that sooner or later it will be accomplished. Comp. the argument of Romans 9-11<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now, saith the Lord</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and now the Lord hath said - he that formed me from the womb to be a Servant to him</span>, <span class="accented">that I might bring back Jacob to him</span>, <span class="accented">and that Israel might be gathered to him</span>; <span class="accented">for I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord</span>, <span class="accented">and my God is become my Strength - he hath said - It is a light thing</span>, etc. The whole of ver. 5, after the words, "and now the Lord hath said," is parenthetic. (On the service which our Lord continually rendered, while on earth, to the Father, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>.) The Revelation of St. John shows that in heaven he is still engaged in carrying out his Father's behests. <span class="cmt_word">Though Israel be not gathered</span>. This reading, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, "entirely spoils the symmetry of the verse." The practice of writing fresh copies of the Scripture <span class="accented">from dictation</span> is answerable for the double reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> both here and in other places. <span class="cmt_word">Yet shall I be glorious</span>. The "Servant" would receive glory even by such a partial conversion of the Jews as took place through his ministry. It is never to be forgotten that all the original twelve apostles were Jews, that Matthias was a Jew, that Paul and Barnabas were Jews, and that the original Church was a Church of Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41-47</a>). All that was truly spiritual in Judaism flowed into the Church of Christ, as into its natural home, and the Jewish element in the Church, if not numerically great, was yet the predominant and formative element. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:1-6 The great Author of redemption shows the authority for his work. The sword of his word slays the lusts of his people, and all at enmity with them. His sharp arrows wound the conscience; but all these wounds will be healed, when the sinner prays to him for mercy. But even the Redeemer, who spake as never man spake in his personal ministry, often seemed to labour in vain. And if Jacob will not be brought back to God, and Israel will not be gathered, still Christ will be glorious. This promise is in part fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles. Men perish in darkness. But Christ enlightens men, and so makes them holy and happy.</body></html>
