While the future is thus glorious, both for the "Servant of the Lord" and for his people Israel, the present is gloom and misery. Zion - not here the city, but the people of God - desponds and says, "Jehovah has forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me" (ver. 14). This burst of grief, though arising from weakness of faith, is forgiven by the compassion of God, and "afflicted" Israel is "comforted" and consoled through the remainder of the chapter (vers. 15-26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing, O heavens</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>). Heaven and earth are called upon to rejoice and "break forth into singing" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because of the glory that awaits the Redeemer (vers. 5-12); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because of the gracious intentions of God with respect to Israel (vers. 16-26). <span class="cmt_word">O mountains</span> The majesty of mountains seems to have deeply impressed Isaiah. Throughout his writings they are continually introduced as the grandest of the works of God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-3.htm">Isaiah 34:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4, 9, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11, 15</a>, etc.). He expects them to be especially ready to sympathize with man. Such a feeling would be natural to one accustomed to the hill-country of Palestine and the lofty heights of Hermon and Lebanon, but could scarcely have been developed in an exile of the time of Cyrus, born and brought up in the dead level of Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">Hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">comforted... will have mercy.</span> Both verbs designate the same action, which is really future, but in God's counsels is already accomplished. The perfect is thus, once more, that of prophetic certitude. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:13-17 Let there be universal joy, for God will have mercy upon the afflicted, because of his compassion; upon his afflicted, because of his covenant. We have no more reason to question his promise and grace, than we have to question his providence and justice. Be assured that God has a tender affection for his church and people; he would not have them to be discouraged. Some mothers do neglect their children; but God's compassions to his people, infinitely exceed those of the tenderest parents toward their children. His setting them as a mark on his hand, or a seal upon his arm, denotes his being ever mindful of them. As far as we have scriptural evidence that we belong to his ransomed flock, we may be sure that he will never forsake us. Let us then give diligence to make our calling and election sure, and rejoice in the hope and glory of God.</body></html>
