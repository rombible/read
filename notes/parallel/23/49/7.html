The point of the words lies in the fact that the doer of the great work is to be despised by the world's judgment or by his own people, by proud rulers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1Corinthians 1:27</a>); and yet he, and no other, will accomplish it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His</span> <span class="cmt_word">Holy One;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the Holy One of Israel." <span class="cmt_word">To him whom man despiseth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">who is despised of souls.</span> This is the first place in the prophecies of Isaiah where this note of the Messiah is brought forward. It is found earlier in the Psalms, as especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>, "I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people;" and later on it is expanded into a chapter (ch. 53.). <span class="cmt_word">Whom the nation abhorreth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whom mankind abhorreth.</span> The term used is <span class="accented">goi</span>, which points to the Gentiles rather than to the Jews. Mankind at large dislikes a "Holy One," since he is a perpetual reproach to it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11</a>; and comp. Plut., 'Republ.,' 7:2, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). It is not the Jews only who exclaim in such a case, "Away with him! away with him!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>). There is such an antagonism between sin and holiness, that the ungodly everywhere and in all ages detest the godly and virtuous. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">servant of rulers</span>; or, <span class="accented">a slave of despots</span>; treated as a slave, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by such irresponsible rulers as Herod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a>) and Pontius Pilate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-1.htm">John 19:1, 16</a>).

According to a tradition - which, however, cannot be traced back to any very ancient source - the Magi who came to worship our Lord at Bethlehem were "kings." The prophecy is, however, to be regarded as having its main fulfilment in the coming to Christ of so many kings and princes, since his ascension into heaven (comp ver. 23). <span class="cmt_word">And the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Holy One of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">that hath chosen thee.</span> Kings will rise from their thrones, and prostrate themselves before Messiah, convinced that Jehovah is faithful in the performance of his promises, and has chosen the Son of Mary to be the Redeemer so long announced as about to appear on earth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:7-12 The Father is the Lord, the Redeemer, and Holy One of Israel, as sending the Son to be the Redeemer. Man, whom he came to save, put contempt upon him. To this he submitted for our salvation. He is a pledge for all the blessings of the covenant; in him God was reconciling the world to himself. Pardoning mercy is a release from the curse of the law; renewing grace is a release from the dominion of sin: both are from Christ. He saith to those in darkness, Show yourselves. Not only see, but be seen, to the glory of God, and your own comforts. Though there are difficulties in the way to heaven, yet the grace of God will carry us over them, and make even the mountains a way. This denotes the free invitations and the encouraging promises of the gospel, and the outpouring of the Spirit.</body></html>
