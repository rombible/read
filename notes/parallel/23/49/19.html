Palestine, after the return from the Captivity, was at no time over-populated; and when the conversion of the Gentiles took place it caused no influx of fresh settlers into the Holy Land. The object of the prophet is simply to mark the vast growth of the Church, which would necessarily spread itself far beyond the limits of Palestine, and would ultimately require the whole earth for its habitation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:18-23 Zion is addressed as an afflicted widow, bereaved of her children.

God can raise up friends for returning Israelites, even among Gentiles. They shall bring their children, and make them thy children.
