The Servant becomes conscious of a higher mission. All national barriers are broken down. He is to be the bearer of a message of peace to the whole race of mankind, and has "other sheep not of this fold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is a light thing</span>. God rewards his servants <span class="accented">according to</span> their works. He is supremely just. He was not content that even Nebuchadnezzar should be insufficiently rewarded for the service that he rendered against Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18</a>), and he therefore gave him Egypt in addition as his recompense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>). It would have been "a light thing" - "too light a thing" (Kay, Cheyne) - to have rewarded the labours of Jesus with the conversion of the Jews only. God therefore gave him as his recompense the gathering in of the Gentiles also, and made him a means of salvation even to the uttermost ends of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">The preserved of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "remnant" that had not perished through previous judgments. <span class="cmt_word">I will also give thee for a Light to the Gentiles</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>, etc.). Greeks <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were brought into contact with our Lord himself shortly before his crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-20.htm">John 12:20</a>). He wrought a miracle for a Syro-Phoenician woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-25.htm">Mark 7:25-30</a>). His apostles, after a little time, understood that the gospel was for the world at large, and declared that in Christ there was no difference between Jew and Greek, nay! between Jew and barbarian. Christ had died for all - had come to be a Light to all, would have all come into his Church and obtain salvation through union with him. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest be my Salvation</span>. Christ is called "Salvation," as the Bearer of salvation - he through whom alone can any man be saved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). So he is called "Peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>), as the Giver of peace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:1-6 The great Author of redemption shows the authority for his work. The sword of his word slays the lusts of his people, and all at enmity with them. His sharp arrows wound the conscience; but all these wounds will be healed, when the sinner prays to him for mercy. But even the Redeemer, who spake as never man spake in his personal ministry, often seemed to labour in vain. And if Jacob will not be brought back to God, and Israel will not be gathered, still Christ will be glorious. This promise is in part fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles. Men perish in darkness. But Christ enlightens men, and so makes them holy and happy.</body></html>
