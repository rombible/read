Who has made them my children? Who has trained them?" That they are not her natural children she is sure, since she knows that she has been for a long time "bereaved and unfruitful" (Cheyne) - a captive, and a "wanderer" (Kay). It is certain that the Jewish Church did not at first altogether welcome the incoming of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>, etc.). But the guidance of the Holy Spirit surmounted the difficulty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:18-23 Zion is addressed as an afflicted widow, bereaved of her children. Numbers flock to her, and she is assured that they come to be a comfort to her. There are times when the church is desolate and few in number; yet its desolations shall not last for ever, and God will repair them. God can raise up friends for returning Israelites, even among Gentiles. They shall bring their children, and make them thy children. Let all deal tenderly and carefully with young converts and beginners in religion. Princes shall protect the church. It shall appear that God is the sovereign Lord of all. And those who in the exercise of faith, hope, and patience, wait on God for the fulfilment of his promises, shall never be confounded.</body></html>
