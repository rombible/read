"Isles" as before stand vaguely for "far off countries." The invitation is addressed to the heathen far and wide.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord hath called me from the womb.</span>--The words indicate a predestined vocation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm" title="Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.">Jeremiah 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm" title="For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.">Luke 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-41.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:">Luke 1:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm" title="But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,">Galatians 1:15</a>.) Admitting the thought of a Divine order working in human history, the idea of such a vocation follows in inevitable sequence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - JEHOVAH'S ATTESTATION OF HIS SERVANT'S MISSION. Jehovah called his Servant from the womb; mentioned him by name; made his mouth a sharp sword; held him in his hand; caused him to be a polished weapon; appointed him his Servant; assured him of a right and a recompense; appointed him, not only to restore and recover Israel, but to be a Light to the Gentiles, and to give salvation to the ends of the world (vers. 1-6); chose him (ver. 7); will help him (ver. 8); through him will both deliver the captive everywhere (ver. 9), and cause joy to break out in every part of heaven and earth (vers. 11-13). It is quite impossible that these things can be said of aught but a person, or of any person other than him in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Listen, O isles</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1, 4, 6</a>). Since the beginning of ch. 43. Israel alone has been addressed. Now that the mission of the Servant of Jehovah is to be treated of, all the world must be summoned to hear, for all the world is directly interested. <span class="cmt_word">Ye people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye peoples</span>, or <span class="accented">ye nations. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Lord hath called me from the womb</span>. Isaiah could not have said this of himself, for his "call" took place when he was of mature age. But Christ was designated for his office from the womb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31-33</a>). He was also still "in the womb of his mother" when the name of Jesus was given to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:1-6 The great Author of redemption shows the authority for his work. The sword of his word slays the lusts of his people, and all at enmity with them. His sharp arrows wound the conscience; but all these wounds will be healed, when the sinner prays to him for mercy. But even the Redeemer, who spake as never man spake in his personal ministry, often seemed to labour in vain. And if Jacob will not be brought back to God, and Israel will not be gathered, still Christ will be glorious. This promise is in part fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles. Men perish in darkness. But Christ enlightens men, and so makes them holy and happy.</body></html>
