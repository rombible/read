He would summon them by his messengers to repent and be converted, and quit the service of sin, and "go forths" from the kingdom of darkness, and "<span class="accented">show</span> themselves" as lights of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>), walking "<span class="accented">as</span> children of the light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>). It is a narrow exegesis which confines the prophet's forecast to the mere return of the exiles to Palestine, and their re-settlement on their ancestral estates. They shall feed in the ways, etc. The returning "prisoners" are now represented as a flock of sheep (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>), whom the good Shepherd will "lead" and "guide" by ways in which they will find sufficient pasture, which shall not fail them even when they pass over bare "hill-tops" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:7-12 The Father is the Lord, the Redeemer, and Holy One of Israel, as sending the Son to be the Redeemer. Man, whom he came to save, put contempt upon him. To this he submitted for our salvation. He is a pledge for all the blessings of the covenant; in him God was reconciling the world to himself. Pardoning mercy is a release from the curse of the law; renewing grace is a release from the dominion of sin: both are from Christ. He saith to those in darkness, Show yourselves. Not only see, but be seen, to the glory of God, and your own comforts. Though there are difficulties in the way to heaven, yet the grace of God will carry us over them, and make even the mountains a way. This denotes the free invitations and the encouraging promises of the gospel, and the outpouring of the Spirit.</body></html>
