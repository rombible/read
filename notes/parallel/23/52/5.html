and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>, Jehovah is represented as deliberating after the manner of men. Again the people have been gratuitously, wantonly attacked; and their groans mingle with the taunting blasphemies of their conquerors. Has not the time come for Him to vindicate His outraged Majesty?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What have I here?</span> rather, <span class="accented">what have r to do here</span>? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what is the task before me - the work that I have to perform? There are three principal considerations by which the answer to this question has to be determined. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Babylonians have obtained possession of the Israelites without purchase - for nought; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> they use their authority harshly and brutally; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> they continually blaspheme the Name of Jehovah. All three are grounds for bringing the captivity to an end, and coming forward with the cry of a deliverer, "Here I am." <span class="cmt_word">Make them to</span> <span class="cmt_word">howl</span>; rather, <span class="accented">howl</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> insult over the captives with shouts and yells of triumph. The prophet is speaking of the Babylonian oppressors, not of the native "rulers," who exercised a certain amount of authority over the captives (see Delitzsch and Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">My Name... is blasphemed</span>. Cruel taskmasters vexed the captives by insulting their God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>52:1-12 The gospel proclaims liberty to those bound with fears. Let those weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, and loose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer for our salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but his own precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and how hurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value the redemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin, recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every follower of Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himself brought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings: keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they are beautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen could scarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainly see the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all the world will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation by Christ. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all in the bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed. They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; but they were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty, are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will not hasten for fear.</body></html>
