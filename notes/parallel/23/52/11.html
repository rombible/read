They are to bring only "the vessels of Jehovah," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the gold and silver which had been taken from His temple, and which Cyrus restored by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a>). In this case the bearers are the Levites. Commonly, however, the phrase is used of "armour-bearers," and this meaning is given to it by many commentators, as pointing to the whole body of the people as filling that function for the great king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/14-27.htm" title="And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.">1Kings 14:27-28</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go ye out from thence</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from Babylon" - the standpoint of the prophet in the present chapter being Jerusalem. When the time came, earnest exhortations to depart would be found not superfluous, for there would be an indisposition on the part of some to quit their possessions, and of others to affront the perils of the way. <span class="accented">Touch</span> no unclean thing. Bring with you none of the Babylonian idols, none of the Babylonian charms, spells, and the like (see the comment on Isaiah 47:9). <span class="cmt_word">Be ye clean</span>; rather, <span class="accented">purify yourselves.</span> The departing captives generally are called upon to avoid polluting themselves with the unclean things of Babylon; but for those who bear the vessels of the Lord this negative purity is insufficient. They are for-really to purify themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>) before undertaking their sacred office. By "<span class="accented">the</span> vessels of the Lord" we must understand those which Nebuchadnezzar carried off from the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-14.htm">2 Kings 25:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>), and which, on the return of the Jews from captivity, were restored by Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7-11</a>) and Artaxerxes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-25.htm">Ezra 8:25-34</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>52:1-12 The gospel proclaims liberty to those bound with fears. Let those weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, and loose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer for our salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but his own precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and how hurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value the redemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin, recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every follower of Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himself brought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings: keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they are beautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen could scarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainly see the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all the world will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation by Christ. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all in the bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed. They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; but they were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty, are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will not hasten for fear.</body></html>
