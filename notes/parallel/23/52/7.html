O Jerusalem, that bring good tidings, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!">Isaiah 40:9</a>. There Zion herself was the herald proclaiming the glad tidings; here the heralds are seen coming to Zion, to tell her that her God is verily reigning, and their feet are beautiful on the mountains like those of an antelope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/2-8.htm" title="The voice of my beloved! behold, he comes leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.">Song of Solomon 2:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm" title="Behold on the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace!

The prophet sees the messenger come bounding over the mountains of Judaea, to bring the news to Jerusalem that her deliverance is come (ver. 7). The angelic watchers sing with joy (ver. 8). The prophet calls upon the waste places of Jerusalem to do the same, and dwells on the greatness of the mercy wrought (vers. 9, 10). Finally, he exhorts the exiles to avail themselves of the permission to quit Babylon, and prophesies that they will go forth in peace, without hurry, under the guidance and protection of God (vers. 11, 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace!</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>, which is almost a repetition of the passage). The <span class="accented">primary</span> meaning is undoubtedly that assigned to the words in the introductory paragraph; but this does not hinder there being also a secondary meaning, viz. the Messianic one of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>. Jerusalem's deliverance is a type of the redemption of the world by Christ. <span class="cmt_word">That saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</span> So long as Israel was in captivity, and Jerusalem in ruins, God's earthly sovereignty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>) was in abeyance. The moment that the Jews were set free and allowed to return and to rebuild their city, his. sovereignty was re-established. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/52.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>52:1-12 The gospel proclaims liberty to those bound with fears. Let those weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, and loose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer for our salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but his own precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and how hurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value the redemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin, recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every follower of Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himself brought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings: keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they are beautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen could scarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainly see the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all the world will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation by Christ. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all in the bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed. They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; but they were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty, are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will not hasten for fear.</body></html>
