The call is addressed as before to Zion, as a castaway. It summons her to the highest glory. She is to put on the <span class= "ital">garments of beauty, </span>which belong to her as the priestly queen of cities. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm" title="And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother for glory and for beauty.">Exodus 28:2</a>.)

Zion is exhorted to rise from the dust, throw off her bonds, and assert her freedom (vers. 1, 2). God will deliver her from this third captivity for his Name's sake, which her oppressors blaspheme (vers. 3-6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, awake; put on thy strength</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). God can help those only who help themselves. The "arm of the Lord" having been called upon to "put on strength" in order to help Zion, Zion is now exhorted to do her part, and put on her own strength. Nor is she to stop there; she is further to rut on her beautiful garments - to array herself in the glorious robes which befit her as a royal and a <span class="cmt_word">holy city,</span> and show herself once more a queen, instead of being content to remain grovelling as a captive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-20.htm">Isaiah 51:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Henceforth there shall no more come into</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee the uncircumcised</span>.

Let those weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, and loose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer for our salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but his own precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and how hurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value the redemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin, recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every follower of Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himself brought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings: keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they are beautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen could scarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainly see the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all the world will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation by Christ. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all in the bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed. They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; but they were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty, are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will not hasten for fear.</body></html>
