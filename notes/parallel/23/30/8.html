The word, we may believe, passed into the act in the presence of his astonished hearers. In some way or other he feels sure that what he is about to utter goes beyond the immediate occasion, and has a lesson for all time which the world would not willingly let die. Others, following the Vulg., take the verb as an imperative: "<span class= "ital">They are boasters; cease from them." </span>(<span class= "ital">Superbia tantum est; quiesce.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-17.</span> - A RENEWAL OF THREATENING. The denunciation of the Egyptian alliance had been made <span class="accented">viva voce</span>, in the courts of the temple or in some other place of public resort. As he ended, Isaiah received a Divine intimation that the prophecy was to be put on record, doubly, upon a tablet and in a book. At the same time, the "<span class="accented">rebelliousness"</span> of the people was further pointed out, and fresh threats (vers. 13, 14, and 17) were uttered against them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write it before them in a tablet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> write the prophecy before them" (equivalent to "<span class="accented">to</span> be set up before them") "<span class="accented">on a</span> tablet," in the briefest possible form (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And note it in a book</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "and also make a full notation of it in a book," or parchment roll. The "tablet" was to be for the admonition of the living generation of men; the "book" was for future generations, to be a record of God's omniscience and faithfulness "forever and ever." <span class="cmt_word">That it may be for the time to come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for an after-day - not</span> for the immediate present only. <span class="cmt_word">For ever and ever</span>. Modern critics observe that the phrase, <span class="accented">la'ad</span> '<span class="accented">ad</span> '<span class="accented">olam</span>, never occurs elsewhere, and suggest a change of the pointing, which would give the sense of "for a testimony forever." Whether we accept the change or not, the meaning undoubtedly is that consigning the prophecy to a "book" would make an appeal to it possible <span class="accented">in perpetuum</span>. The perpetuity of the written Word is assumed as certain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:8-18 The Jews were the only professing people God then had in the world, yet many among them were rebellious. They had the light, but they loved darkness rather. The prophets checked them in their sinful pursuits, so that they could not proceed without fear; this they took amiss. But faithful ministers will not be driven from seeking to awaken sinners. God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him. They did not like to hear of his holy commandments and his hatred of sin; they desired that they might no more be reminded of these things. But as they despised the word of God, their sins undermined their safety. Their state would be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel. Let us return from our evil ways, and settle in the way of duty; that is the way to be saved. Would we be strengthened, it must be in quietness and in confidence, keeping peace in our own minds, and relying upon God. They think themselves wiser than God; but the project by which they thought to save themselves was their ruin. Only here and there one shall escape, as a warning to others. If men will not repent, turn to God, and seek happiness in his favour and service, their desires will but hasten their ruin. Those who make God alone their confidence, will have comfort. God ever waits to be gracious to all that come to him by faith in Christ, and happy are those who wait for him.</body></html>
