The mountains and hills, often so dry and barren, should flow down with rivers of waters, and irrigate the valleys. And this should coincide with the day of a "great slaughter," perhaps of the enemies of Israel, perhaps also of the people themselves (judgment coming before the blessing), and of the fall of the "towers" in which they had put their trust. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-4.htm" title="Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:">Isaiah 40:4</a>.) As before, man's extremity was to be God's opportunity. Possibly, however, the "towers" are those of the besiegers of the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rivers and streams of water</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rivulets</span>, <span class="accented">courses of water</span>.

In this allegorical intention the waters stand for the streams of God's grace. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the great slaughter</span>. Equivalent to "the day of vengeance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>) the day when God shall tread down his enemies. The prophet passes from the immediate effect of Judah's repentance to a broader view of what shall happen when God's kingdom is established upon the earth. <span class="cmt_word">When the towers fall</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when there shall be a general "pulling down of strong holds," and a "casting down of every high thing that exalts itself against God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4, 5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:19-26 God's people will soon arrive at the Zion above, and then they will weep no more for ever. Even now they would have more comfort, as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine of bread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. There are right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting us into by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God the Spirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong. They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sin becomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundant means of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would be extended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should be comfort and joy to the people of God. Light, that is, knowledge, shall increase. This is the light which the gospel brought into the world, and which proclaims healing to the broken-hearted.</body></html>
