In other respects the vision of the Theophany has its parallels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.">Judges 5:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-17.htm" title="And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.">Exodus 24:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And the burden thereof is heavy.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in thick uplifting of smoke.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-33.</span> - A PROPHECY OF ASSYRIA'S DESTRUCTION. Mr. Chcyne regards this passage as "a symbolic description of <span class="accented">the judgment</span> introduced by a theophany." But is it not rather a poetical description of God's judgment on Assyria, which may be, probably is, a type of his final judgment upon an iniquitous world? The mention of Assyria in ver. 31 seems to be decisive in favor of the prophecy being (primarily) of special application to the circumstances of the time. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Name of the Lord cometh from far</span>. "The Name of Jehovah" is scarcely distinguishable from Jehovah himself. Jehovah, who has long hid himself, and seemed to keep himself remote from worldly affairs, now is about to manifest his glory, and interpose in the doings of men in a wonderful way. <span class="cmt_word">Burning with his anger</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his anger burneth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the burden thereof is heavy</span>; "<span class="accented">anti</span> heavy is its grievousness." <span class="cmt_word">His tongue as a devouring fire</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-19.htm">Isaiah 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:27-33 God curbs and restrains from doing mischief. With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.</body></html>
