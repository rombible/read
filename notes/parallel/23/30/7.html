"Rahab sitting still" was one of those <span class= "ital">mots </span>which stamp themselves upon a nation's memory, just as in modern times the Bourbons have been characterised as "learning nothing, forgetting nothing," or Bismarck's policy as one of "blood and iron."

Rahab, "pride" or 'arrogance," would seem to have been an old name for Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), not one given at this time by Isaiah. What he means to say is, "Proud as thou art, thou doest nothing to maintain thy pride, but art content with sitting still." This he "cries" or "proclaims" concerning Egypt, as the most important thing for other nations to know about her. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-7 It was often the fault and folly of the Jews, that when troubled by their neighbours on one side, they sought for succour from others, instead of looking up to God. Nor can we avoid the dreadful consequences of adding sin to sin, but by making the righteousness of Christ our refuge, and seeking for the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Men have always been prone to lean to their own understandings, but this will end in their shame and misery. They would not trust in God. They took much pains to gain the Egyptians. The riches so spent turned to a bad account. See what dangers men run into who forsake God to follow their carnal confidences. The Creator is the Rock of ages, the creature a broken reed; we cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God. Our strength is to sit still, in humble dependence upon God and his goodness, and quiet submission to his will.</body></html>
