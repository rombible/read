In this case it was the turning from the trust in man, with all its restless excitement, to a trust in God, full of calmness and of peace.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel.</span> As the irreligious party wished to hear no more of "the Holy One of Israel" (ver. 11), Isaiah takes care to keep him constantly before their minds (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In returning and rest shall ye be saved</span>; rather, <span class="accented">should ye be saved</span>, or <span class="accented">might ye be saved</span>. The conditions are put forward, not as now capable of being realized, but as those which might have been realized at an earlier date. The "returning" spoken of is an abandonment of the course hitherto pursued, which was reckless provocation of Assyria and trust in Egypt. The "rest" is staying upon God - renunciation of trust on any arm of flesh, and simple reliance on the Divine aid, as sure to be sufficient when the need came. <span class="cmt_word">In quietness and confidence shall be your strength</span>; rather, <span class="accented">should be</span>. The clause is a mere iteration in other words of the preceding one. <span class="cmt_word">Ye would not</span>. They had practically rejected the policy of quiescence and patient waiting upon God, when they sent the embassy into Egypt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:8-18 The Jews were the only professing people God then had in the world, yet many among them were rebellious. They had the light, but they loved darkness rather. The prophets checked them in their sinful pursuits, so that they could not proceed without fear; this they took amiss. But faithful ministers will not be driven from seeking to awaken sinners. God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him. They did not like to hear of his holy commandments and his hatred of sin; they desired that they might no more be reminded of these things. But as they despised the word of God, their sins undermined their safety. Their state would be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel. Let us return from our evil ways, and settle in the way of duty; that is the way to be saved. Would we be strengthened, it must be in quietness and in confidence, keeping peace in our own minds, and relying upon God. They think themselves wiser than God; but the project by which they thought to save themselves was their ruin. Only here and there one shall escape, as a warning to others. If men will not repent, turn to God, and seek happiness in his favour and service, their desires will but hasten their ruin. Those who make God alone their confidence, will have comfort. God ever waits to be gracious to all that come to him by faith in Christ, and happy are those who wait for him.</body></html>
