There seems no reason, however, why the prophet should not have prefixed it as with the sarcasm of an indignant irony.

Delitzsch thinks that the Egyptians are intended by the "beasts of the south" - the expression pointing primarily to the hippopotamus, which was an apt emblem of the slow-moving Egyptians. But most commentators regard the "beasts" of this clause as equivalent to the "<span class="accented">young</span> asses and camels" mentioned towards the end of the verse. (On the sense of the word "burden," see the introductory paragraph to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Into the lane of trouble and anguish</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through a laud</span>. It is not Egypt that is spoken of, but the desert between Judaea and Egypt. The reminiscences of this desert were such that the Israelites always exaggerated its terrors and dangers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From whence come the young and old lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lioness and the lion</span> (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; vol. 1. p. 227). Lions can never have been numerous in the tract in question; but they may have haunted portions of it, when it was better watered than at present. <span class="cmt_word">The viper and fiery flying serpent</span>. Snakes of various kinds have always been abundant in the desert between Judaea and Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>; Strab., 16. p. 759; Schubert,' Travels,' sol. it. p. 406; Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 499, etc.). Seine of them were believed anciently to have wings (Herod., 2:75; 3:107); but the fact is doubted. Isaiah is not concerned with natural history, but with definitely marking out the locality through which the ambassadors would march. For this purpose it was best to describe it in terms drawn from the popular belief. <span class="cmt_word">Their riches... their treasures</span>.

Nor can we avoid the dreadful consequences of adding sin to sin, but by making the righteousness of Christ our refuge, and seeking for the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Men have always been prone to lean to their own understandings, but this will end in their shame and misery. They would not trust in God. They took much pains to gain the Egyptians. The riches so spent turned to a bad account. See what dangers men run into who forsake God to follow their carnal confidences. The Creator is the Rock of ages, the creature a broken reed; we cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God. Our strength is to sit still, in humble dependence upon God and his goodness, and quiet submission to his will.</body></html>
