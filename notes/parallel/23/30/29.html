In later times, and probably, therefore, in earlier, it had a night-ritual of special solemnity, the court of the Temple being illuminated with a great candelabrum. It was known as being pre-eminently <span class= "ital">"the </span>feast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1Kings 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.">1Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm" title="And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.">1Kings 12:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-25.htm" title="In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.">Ezekiel 45:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/7-8.htm" title="Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt.">2Chronicles 7:8-9</a>). The second clause of the verse completes the picture, by introducing the day-ritual of the procession of pilgrims from the country, bringing their firstfruits and playing on their flutes. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The mighty One of Israel.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the Rock of Israel, </span>as a name of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm" title="Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the rock of your strength, therefore shall you plant pleasant plants, and shall set it with strange slips:">Isaiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall have a song</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to you will</span> [<span class="accented">then</span>] <span class="accented">be a song</span>. While the nations weep and lament, and are burnt up by God's anger, and swept away by his "overflowing flood," and guided to their destruction by his bridle in their jaws, Israel shall rejoice with singing. <span class="cmt_word">As in the night when a holy solemnity is kept</span>. Perhaps a special reference is intended to the Pass-over-feast, which commenced with an even-tag or night celebration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6, 8, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-30.htm">Matthew 26:30</a>). Or perhaps "Isaiah is not referring to one feast more than another" (Cheyne), night-rituals belonging to all toasts, since the day commenced with the sunset. The Passover-song consisted of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113</a>. - 118. <span class="cmt_word">And as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord</span>. Joyful processions from the country districts to Jerusalem are alluded to. These were commonly headed by a piper or a band of pipers (Vitringa). They took place several times in the year - at each of the three great feasts, and irregularly when any district sent up its firstfruits to the temple treasury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-35.htm">Nehemiah 10:35-37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the Mighty One of Israel</span>; literally, to <span class="accented">the Rock of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Jehovah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2, 31, 46</a>, etc.). The idea embodied in the metaphor is rather that of an unfailing refuge than of mere might and power. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:27-33 God curbs and restrains from doing mischief. With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.</body></html>
