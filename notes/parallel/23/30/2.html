Either the Jewish ambassadors have already started, or the anticipatory vision of the prophet sees them as if starting.

It is very uncertain who is the "Pharaoh" here intended. The supreme power over Egypt was probably, at the time, in the hands of Tirkakah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm">2 Kings 19:9</a>); but Lower Egypt seems to have been ruled by various princes, the chief of whom was Shabatok, and any one of these may have been regarded by Isaiah as a "Pharaoh." <span class="cmt_word">To trust in the shadow of Egypt.</span> Trust in the "shadow of God" was an expression very familiar to the Jews (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-7.htm">Psalm 36:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>). To "trust in the shadow of Egypt" was to put Egypt in the place of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-7 It was often the fault and folly of the Jews, that when troubled by their neighbours on one side, they sought for succour from others, instead of looking up to God. Nor can we avoid the dreadful consequences of adding sin to sin, but by making the righteousness of Christ our refuge, and seeking for the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Men have always been prone to lean to their own understandings, but this will end in their shame and misery. They would not trust in God. They took much pains to gain the Egyptians. The riches so spent turned to a bad account. See what dangers men run into who forsake God to follow their carnal confidences. The Creator is the Rock of ages, the creature a broken reed; we cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God. Our strength is to sit still, in humble dependence upon God and his goodness, and quiet submission to his will.</body></html>
