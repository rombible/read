For this there should be the compensation that the true "teachers" of the people, Isaiah and his fellow-workers, should at least be recognised--no longer thrust into a corner, as they had been in the days of Ahaz. The clearer vision of the truth was to be the outcome of the sharp teaching of chastisement. A various reading gives "<span class= "ital">thy teacher," i.e., </span>Jehovah Himself; but the plural seems more in harmony with the context. In the mission of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-2.htm" title="And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.">Isaiah 37:2</a> we have a virtual fulfilment of the prediction.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity</span> (so Mr. Cheyne).

A persecution of Jehovah's prophets had commenced in Judah during the reign of Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19-22</a>), and had probably continued with more or less severity ever since. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:19-26 God's people will soon arrive at the Zion above, and then they will weep no more for ever. Even now they would have more comfort, as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine of bread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. There are right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting us into by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God the Spirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong. They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sin becomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls, by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundant means of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would be extended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should be comfort and joy to the people of God. Light, that is, knowledge, shall increase. This is the light which the gospel brought into the world, and which proclaims healing to the broken-hearted.</body></html>
