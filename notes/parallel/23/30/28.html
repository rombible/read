Here, the mouth, in which there is a tongue of fire, sends forth a rush of breath, which is compared to an "overflowing stream, which reaches to the middle of the neck, "and sweeps those who try to cross it away (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-5.htm">Ezekiel 47:5</a>) <span class="cmt_word">To sift the nations with the sieve of vanity</span>. More incongruity, to be excused by the writer's theme being such as to transcend all language and all imagery. One of the Divine purposes, in all violent crashes and revolutions, is "to sift nations" - <span class="accented">to</span> separate in each nation the good from the bad, the precious from the vile; and this is done with "<span class="accented">the</span> sieve of vanity," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sieve which allows the good corn to pass through, separating from it, and keeping back, all that is vile and refuse (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.</span> Another entire change in the metaphor. The result of God's interference shall be "to put a bridle in the jaws of the <span class="accented">peoples</span>," whereby the hand of the Almighty will guide them to their destruction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:27-33 God curbs and restrains from doing mischief. With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.</body></html>
