Tophet was the name given to the Valley of Hinnom, outside Jerusalem, where, within the memory of living men, Ahaz had made his son to pass through the fire to Moloch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2Kings 16:3</a>), and where like sacrifices had taken place up to the time of Hezekiah's accession. "The king" is, of course, the king of Assyria; but the Hebrew, "for the <span class= "ital">melek," </span>suggests a sarcastic reference to the god there worshipped, as if it were "for Moloch." There was to be a great sacrifice of the <span class= "ital">Melek </span>to the <span class= "ital">Moloch, </span>who was as a mighty king (the name of the Ammonite god being a dialectic form of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Melek</span>) exulting in his victims. (Comp. for the idea <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-9.htm" title="And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, said the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.">Isaiah 31:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The pile thereof is fire and much wood.</span>--The word seems partly literal, and partly figurative. The king of Assyria, though he did not die at Jerusalem, is represented as burnt with stately ceremonial in Tophet. Probably, as a matter of fact, it was the burial place of the corpses that were lying round the city after the pestilence had destroyed the Assyrian army, and they were literally burnt there. For such a Moloch funeral, making the valley of Hinnom then, as it afterwards became, a fit type of Gehenna, a trench deep and wide and a mighty pyre were needed. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-12.htm" title="Thus will I do to this place, said the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:">Jeremiah 19:12</a>, where like words are spoken of Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Tophet is ordained of old</span>; rather, for <span class="accented">a Tophet has been long since prepared</span>. A "Tophet" is a place of burning, probably derived from the Aryan root <span class="accented">tap</span> or <span class="accented">taph</span>, found in Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, Latin <span class="accented">tep</span>-idus, Sanskrit <span class="accented">tap</span>, Persian <span class="accented">taphtan</span>. The name was specially attached to a particular spot in the Valley of Hinnom, where sacrifices were offered to Moloch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6, 11</a>, etc.); but Isaiah seems to use it generically, as if there were many Tophets. <span class="cmt_word">For the king it is prepared</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it also is prepared for the king - in</span> the Hebrew "for the <span class="accented">moloch</span>," which is the same word as "Moloch," who was looked upon by his worshippers as "the king" <span class="greek">&#x3c2;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. Isaiah means to say, "As the Tophet of the Vale of Hinnom is prepared for a king (Moloch), so this new Tophet is prepared for another king (the King of Assyria)." <span class="cmt_word">He hath made it deep and large</span> - a vast burning-place for a vast multitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>), with the <span class="cmt_word">fire and the wood</span> ready, only <span class="cmt_word">awaiting the breath of Jehovah to kindle it</span>. As the bodies of great malefactors were burnt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>), and not buried, so the prophet consigns to a great burning the hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrian corpses, of which it would soon be necessary to dispose in some way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:27-33 God curbs and restrains from doing mischief. With a word he guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns his enemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin of Sennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley near Jerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things that were hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused their children to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certainty of the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in the other world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinners then flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may be safe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away all the workers of iniquity.</body></html>
