Ardent dreams of reformation and revival, the nation renewing its strength like the eagle, were scattered to the winds; and he had to face the prospect of a fruitless labour, of feeling that he did but increase the evil against which he strove. It was the very opposite mission of that to which St. Paul was sent, to "open men's eyes, and turn them from darkness to light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>). It is significant that the words that followed were quoted both by the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-12.htm" title="That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.">Mark 4:12</a>), by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm" title="He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.">John 12:40</a>), and by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/28-26.htm" title="Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:">Acts 28:26-27</a>), as finding their fulfilment in their own work and the analogous circumstances of their own time. History was repeating itself. To Isaiah, as with greater clearness to St. Paul (Romans 9-11), there was given the support of the thought that the failure which he saw was not total, that even then a "remnant should be saved;" that though his people had "stumbled," they had not "fallen" irretrievably; that the ideal Israel should one day be realised. The words point at once to the guilt of "this people "--we note the touch of scorn ("populus <span class= "ital">iste"</span>) in the manner in which they are mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm" title="For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,">Isaiah 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-11.htm" title="For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.">Isaiah 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-14.htm" title="Why hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.">Isaiah 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm" title="And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.">Matthew 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>)--and to its punishment. All was outward with them. Words did not enter into their minds ("heart," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"understanding," rather than "feeling"). Events that were "signs of the times," calls to repentance or to action, were taken as things of course. For such a state, after a certain stage, there is but one treatment. It must run its course and "dree its weird," partly as a righteous retribution, partly as the only remedial process possible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye indeed... see ye indeed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">hearing hear</span>... <span class="accented">in seeing see -</span> with the force of "Listen and bear; look and see;" "Attend, "that is," with the outward souse, and catch all that sense can catch, but without perception of the inward meaning" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>, etc.). This is what they would do. Isaiah is bidden to exhort them, in grave irony, to do it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-13 God sends Isaiah to foretell the ruin of his people. Many hear the sound of God's word, but do not feel the power of it. God sometimes, in righteous judgment, gives men up to blindness of mind, because they will not receive the truth in the love of it. But no humble inquirer after Christ, need to fear this awful doom, which is a spiritual judgment on those who will still hold fast their sins. Let every one pray for the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, that he may perceive how precious are the Divine mercies, by which alone we are secured against this dreadful danger. Yet the Lord would preserve a remnant, like the tenth, holy to him. And blessed be God, he still preserves his church; however professors or visible churches may be lopped off as unfruitful, the holy seed will shoot forth, from whom all the numerous branches of righteousness shall arise.</body></html>
