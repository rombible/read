From the first hour of Isaiah's call the thought of an exile and a return from exile was the key-note of his teaching, and of that thought thus given in germ, his whole after-work was but a development, the horizon of his vision expanding and taking in the form of another empire than the Assyrian as the instrument of punishment.<p><span class= "bld">And there be a great forsaking.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">great shall be the deserted space. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-9.htm" title="In my ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.">Isaiah 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/7-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.">Isaiah 7:22-23</a>.)

Many hear the sound of God's word, but do not feel the power of it. God sometimes, in righteous judgment, gives men up to blindness of mind, because they will not receive the truth in the love of it. But no humble inquirer after Christ, need to fear this awful doom, which is a spiritual judgment on those who will still hold fast their sins. Let every one pray for the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, that he may perceive how precious are the Divine mercies, by which alone we are secured against this dreadful danger. Yet the Lord would preserve a remnant, like the tenth, holy to him. And blessed be God, he still preserves his church; however professors or visible churches may be lopped off as unfruitful, the holy seed will shoot forth, from whom all the numerous branches of righteousness shall arise.</body></html>
