He is as an angel called <span class= "ital">to </span>an angel's work. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Judges 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-23.htm" title="Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.">Judges 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a>.) He had before seen the glory of Jehovah, and had been overwhelmed with terror. Now he hears His voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm" title="And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.">John 10:4</a>), and it rouses him to self-consecration and activity.<p><span class= "bld">Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?</span>--The union of the singular and plural in the same sentence is significant. The latter does not admit of being explained as a <span class= "ital">pluralis majestatis, </span>for the great kings of Assyria, and Babylon, and Persia always spoke of themselves in the singular (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, passim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the "plural of majesty" was an invention of the servility of the Byzantine court. A partial explanation is found in the fact that here, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.">Job 2:1</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm" title="Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.">Genesis 11:7</a>), Jehovah is represented as a king in council. Christian thought has, however, scarcely erred in believing that the words were as a dim foreshadowing of the truth, afterwards to be revealed, of a plurality within the Unity. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>, which Isaiah may have known, suggested at least a duality. The question reveals to the prophet that there is a work to be done for Jehovah, that He needs an instrument for that work. It is implied that no angel out of the whole host, no man out of the whole nation, offers to undertake it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm" title="I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.">Isaiah 63:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-5.htm" title="And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my fury, it upheld me.">Isaiah 63:5</a>.) The prophet, with the ardour for work which follows on the sense of pardon, volunteers for it before he knows what it is. He reaches in one moment the supreme height <span class= "ital">of </span>the faith which went forth, not knowing whither it went (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-8.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.">Hebrews 11:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - THE PROPHET ENTRUSTED WITH A SPECIAL MISSON. We do not know what special call Isaiah had had previously. Perhaps he had been brought up in the "schools of the prophets." Perhaps, when the "word of the Lord" came to him, he had accepted the fact as sufficient call. Now, however, he had, in vision, a clear and distinct call and mission (vers. 8, 9). He was told to "go," and instructed as to what he was to say (vers. 9, 10). As before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1-5</a>.), while in the main he was to denounce woe, he was still to proclaim the survival of a remnant (vers. 10-12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom shall I send?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>). Such questions enable those who wait in the courts of heaven to show their zeal and readiness. <span class="cmt_word">Who will go for us?</span> Some explain the plural pronoun as used of the Almighty and those with whom he is consulting. But he does not really "consult" his creatures (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-14.htm">Isaiah 40:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>), nor do his messengers do his errands <span class="accented">for them</span>. The plural form is best explained by the light which ver. 3 throws on it, as indicative of the doctrine of the Trinity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 In this figurative vision, the temple is thrown open to view, even to the most holy place. The prophet, standing outside the temple, sees the Divine Presence seated on the mercy-seat, raised over the ark of the covenant, between the cherubim and seraphim, and the Divine glory filled the whole temple. See God upon his throne. This vision is explained, Joh 12:41, that Isaiah now saw Christ's glory, and spake of Him, which is a full proof that our Saviour is God. In Christ Jesus, God is seated on a throne of grace; and through him the way into the holiest is laid open. See God's temple, his church on earth, filled with his glory. His train, the skirts of his robes, filled the temple, the whole world, for it is all God's temple. And yet he dwells in every contrite heart. See the blessed attendants by whom his government is served. Above the throne stood the holy angels, called seraphim, which means burners; they burn in love to God, and zeal for his glory against sin. The seraphim showing their faces veiled, declares that they are ready to yield obedience to all God's commands, though they do not understand the secret reasons of his counsels, government, or promises. All vain-glory, ambition, ignorance, and pride, would be done away by one view of Christ in his glory. This awful vision of the Divine Majesty overwhelmed the prophet with a sense of his own vileness. We are undone if there is not a Mediator between us and this holy God. A glimpse of heavenly glory is enough to convince us that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Nor is there a man that would dare to speak to the Lord, if he saw the justice, holiness, and majesty of God, without discerning his glorious mercy and grace in Jesus Christ. The live coal may denote the assurance given to the prophet, of pardon, and acceptance in his work, through the atonement of Christ. Nothing is powerful to cleanse and comfort the soul, but what is taken from Christ's satisfaction and intercession. The taking away sin is necessary to our speaking with confidence and comfort, either to God in prayer, or from God in preaching; and those shall have their sin taken away who complain of it as a burden, and see themselves in danger of being undone by it. It is great comfort to those whom God sends, that they go for God, and may therefore speak in his name, assured that he will bear them out.</body></html>
