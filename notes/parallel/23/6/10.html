as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm" title="And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.">Exodus 9:34</a>, &c) and that of Sihon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm" title="But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as appears this day.">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>). It implies the reckless headstrong will which defies restraint and warnings. So the poets of Greece, in their thoughts as to the Divine government of the world, recognised the truth that there is a judicial blindness and, as it were, insanity of will that comes as the consequence of sinful deeds ( 'sch. <span class= "ital">Agam. </span>370-386). The mediaeval adage, "<span class= "ital">Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat," </span>expresses one aspect of the same law; but the <span class= "ital">vult perdere </span>is excluded by the clearer revelation of the Divine purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm" title="Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? said the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?">Ezekiel 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-9.htm" title="The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:">2Peter 2:9</a>), as "not willing that any should perish."<p><span class= "bld">Shut their eyes.</span>--Literally, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm" title="For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.">Isaiah 29:10</a>, <span class= "ital">daub, </span>or <span class= "ital">besmear. </span>Possibly the phrase refers to the barbarous practice, not unknown in the East, of thus closing the eyes as a punishment. Burder (<span class= "ital">Oriental Customs, </span>i. 98) mentions a son of the Great Mogul who was thus punished by his father. For the ethical fact, as well as for the phrase, we may (with Cheyne) compare Shakespeare--<p>"For when we in our viciousness grow hard,<p>Oh, misery on't, the wise gods seal our eyes."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make the heart of this people fat.</span> Isaiah is commanded to effect by his preaching that which his preaching would, in fact, effect. It would not awaken the people out of their apathy, it would not stir them to repentance; therefore it would only harden and deaden them. The words have a national, not an individual, application. <span class="cmt_word">Shut their eyes</span>; literally, <span class="accented">besmear their eyes</span>; or, <span class="accented">seal them up</span>. Such sealing has been employed by Oriental monarchs as a punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And convert</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "turn to God." Our translators have used the word in an intransitive sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-13 God sends Isaiah to foretell the ruin of his people. Many hear the sound of God's word, but do not feel the power of it. God sometimes, in righteous judgment, gives men up to blindness of mind, because they will not receive the truth in the love of it. But no humble inquirer after Christ, need to fear this awful doom, which is a spiritual judgment on those who will still hold fast their sins. Let every one pray for the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, that he may perceive how precious are the Divine mercies, by which alone we are secured against this dreadful danger. Yet the Lord would preserve a remnant, like the tenth, holy to him. And blessed be God, he still preserves his church; however professors or visible churches may be lopped off as unfruitful, the holy seed will shoot forth, from whom all the numerous branches of righteousness shall arise.</body></html>
