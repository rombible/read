How long shall all this last? So a later prophet, towards the close of the seventy years of exile, cried once again, "How long?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13</a>). So the cry, "How long, O Lord, dost thou not judge?" came from the souls beneath the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant.</span>--The words answer the immediate question of the prophet within its horizon. They suggest an answer to all analogous questions. Stroke after stroke must come, judgment after judgment, till the sin has been adequately punished; but the darkness of the prospect, terrible as it is, does not exclude the glimmer of an eternal hope for the far-off future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said I, Lord, how long?</span> Either, "How long am I to continue this preaching?" or, "How long is this blindness and callousness of the people to continue?" Isaiah assumes that he has not heard as yet God's final purpose; that there is some merciful intention kept in reserve, which is to take effect after the close of the period of judgment. <span class="cmt_word">The cities... the houses;</span> rather, <span class="accented">cities</span>... <span class="accented">houses</span>. An entire desolation of the whole land, and extermination of its inhabitants, is not prophesied, and never took place. Nebuchadnezzar "left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>). Even when the great mass of these persons went into Egypt and perished there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11-27</a>), a certain number escaped and returned to Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the ground</span>, <span class="accented">the soil</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-13 God sends Isaiah to foretell the ruin of his people. Many hear the sound of God's word, but do not feel the power of it. God sometimes, in righteous judgment, gives men up to blindness of mind, because they will not receive the truth in the love of it. But no humble inquirer after Christ, need to fear this awful doom, which is a spiritual judgment on those who will still hold fast their sins. Let every one pray for the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, that he may perceive how precious are the Divine mercies, by which alone we are secured against this dreadful danger. Yet the Lord would preserve a remnant, like the tenth, holy to him. And blessed be God, he still preserves his church; however professors or visible churches may be lopped off as unfruitful, the holy seed will shoot forth, from whom all the numerous branches of righteousness shall arise.</body></html>
