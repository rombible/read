So Moses "hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm" title="Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.">Exodus 3:6</a>). So Job "abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-6.htm" title="Why I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.">Job 42:6</a>). So Peter fell down at his Lord's feet, and cried, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>). Man at such a time feels his nothingness in the presence of the Eternal, his guilt in the presence of the All-holy. No man can see God and live. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-20.htm" title="And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?">1Samuel 6:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I am a man of unclean lips.</span>--The prophet's words present at once a parallel and a contrast to those of Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>. The Lawgiver feels only, or chiefly, his want of the <span class= "ital">gift </span>of utterance which was needed for his work. With Isaiah the dominant thought is that his lips have been defiled by past sins of speech. How can he join in the praises of the seraphim with those lips from which have so often come bitter and hasty words, formal and ceremonial prayers? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm" title="For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.">James 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm" title="Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.">James 3:9</a>). His lips are "unclean" like those of one stricken, as Uzziah had been, by leprosy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a>). He finds no comfort in the thought that others are as bad as he is, that he "dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips." Were it otherwise, there might be some hope that influence from without might work his purification. As it is, he and his people seem certain to sink into the abyss. To "have seen the King, the Lord of hosts," was in such a case simply overwhelming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - THE SEQUEL OF THE VISION - THE PROPHET'S SENSE OF UNWORTHINESS. The vision of God in this life, whether natural or ecstatic, cannot but produce in the beholder a deep feeling of his unworthiness. God "is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;" even "the heavens are not clean in his sight" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>). Man, being never wholly purged from sin while on earth, cannot but shrink from contact with the absolutely Holy. Hence Isaiah's cry (ver. 5); and hence, to comfort him, the symbolic action of the seraph (ver. 6) and his encouraging words (ver. 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am undone</span>; literally, <span class="accented">cut off</span>, <span class="accented">destroyed</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5, 6</a>, etc.). God once said himself, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). Men expected to die even when they had seen angels of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>). How we are to reconcile <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a> with this passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>, is uncertain. Perhaps the <span class="accented">ecstatic</span> sight was not included in the "<span class="accented">seeing"</span> <span class="accented">of</span> which God spoke to Moses. <span class="cmt_word">I am a man of unclean lips.</span> A man must be indeed" perfect" never to offend in word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). Isaiah felt that he had often so offended. His lips were not "<span class="accented">clean"</span> in God's sight, and if not his lips, then not his heart; for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.</span> Men catch up the phraseology of their time, and use wrong forms of speech, because they hear them daily. "Evil communications corrupt good manners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 In this figurative vision, the temple is thrown open to view, even to the most holy place. The prophet, standing outside the temple, sees the Divine Presence seated on the mercy-seat, raised over the ark of the covenant, between the cherubim and seraphim, and the Divine glory filled the whole temple. See God upon his throne. This vision is explained, Joh 12:41, that Isaiah now saw Christ's glory, and spake of Him, which is a full proof that our Saviour is God. In Christ Jesus, God is seated on a throne of grace; and through him the way into the holiest is laid open. See God's temple, his church on earth, filled with his glory. His train, the skirts of his robes, filled the temple, the whole world, for it is all God's temple. And yet he dwells in every contrite heart. See the blessed attendants by whom his government is served. Above the throne stood the holy angels, called seraphim, which means burners; they burn in love to God, and zeal for his glory against sin. The seraphim showing their faces veiled, declares that they are ready to yield obedience to all God's commands, though they do not understand the secret reasons of his counsels, government, or promises. All vain-glory, ambition, ignorance, and pride, would be done away by one view of Christ in his glory. This awful vision of the Divine Majesty overwhelmed the prophet with a sense of his own vileness. We are undone if there is not a Mediator between us and this holy God. A glimpse of heavenly glory is enough to convince us that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Nor is there a man that would dare to speak to the Lord, if he saw the justice, holiness, and majesty of God, without discerning his glorious mercy and grace in Jesus Christ. The live coal may denote the assurance given to the prophet, of pardon, and acceptance in his work, through the atonement of Christ. Nothing is powerful to cleanse and comfort the soul, but what is taken from Christ's satisfaction and intercession. The taking away sin is necessary to our speaking with confidence and comfort, either to God in prayer, or from God in preaching; and those shall have their sin taken away who complain of it as a burden, and see themselves in danger of being undone by it. It is great comfort to those whom God sends, that they go for God, and may therefore speak in his name, assured that he will bear them out.</body></html>
