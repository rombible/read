Had it been after it, the first year of king Jotham would have been the more natural formula. The chapter gives us the narrative of the solemn call of Isaiah to the office of a prophet. It does not follow that it was written at that time, and we may even believe that, if the prophet were the editor of his own discourses, he may have designedly placed the narrative in this position that men might see what he himself saw, that all that was found in the preceding chapters was but the development of what he had then heard, and yet, at the same time, a representation of the evils which made the judgments he was commissioned to declare necessary. On the relation of the call to the prophet's previous life, see <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span><p>The date is obviously given as important, and we are led to connect it with the crisis in the prophet's life of which it tells. He had lived through the last twenty years or so of Uzziah's reign. There was the show of outward material prosperity. There was the reality of much inward corruption. The king who had profaned the holiness of the Temple had either just died or was dragging out the dregs of his leprous life in seclusion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-21.htm" title="And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelled in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.">2Chronicles 26:21</a>). The question, What was to be the future of his people? must have been much in the prophet's thoughts. The earthquake that had terrified Jerusalem had left on his mind a vague sense of impending judgment. It is significant that Isaiah's first work as a writer was to write the history of Uzziah's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-22.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.">2Chronicles 26:22</a>). (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne.</span>--Isaiah had found himself in 'the court of the Temple, probably in that of the priests. He had seen the incense-clouds rising from the censer of the priest, and had heard the hymns and hallelujahs of the Levites. Suddenly he passes, as St. Paul afterwards passed, under the influence of like surroundings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>), into a state of ecstatic trance, and as though the veil of the Temple was withdrawn, he saw the vision of the glory of the Lord, as Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>) and Micaiah of old had seen it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19</a>), as in more recent times it had appeared to Amos (9:1). The King of kings was seated on His throne, and on the right hand and on the left were the angel-armies of the host of heaven, chanting their hymns of praise.<p><span class= "bld">His train filled the temple.</span>--The word for "temple" is that which expresses its character as the <span class= "ital">palace </span>of the great King. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm" title="The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-9.htm" title="The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.">Psalm 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-20.htm" title="But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.">Habakkuk 2:20</a>.) The "train" answers to the skirts of the glory of the Lord, who clothes Himself with light as with a garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:">Exodus 33:22-23</a>). It is noticeable (1) that the versions (LXX., Targum, Vulg.) suppress the train, apparently as being too anthropomorphic, and (2) that to the mind of St. John this was a vision of the glory of the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-41.htm" title="These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.">John 12:41</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - THE VISION OF GOD SEEN BY ISAIAH. It is thought by some that this vision, and its sequel, constitute the original call of Isaiah to the prophetical office, and in order of time precede all the other contents of the book. But the position of the "vision" in the book is strongly against this view. Prophets who relate their original call naturally place it in the forefront of their narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>). It is quite possible, as Bishop Lowth says, that this was "a <span class="accented">new</span> designation, to introduce more solemnly a general declaration of the whole course of God's dispensations in regard to his people, and the fates of the nations." The vision itself may profitably be compared with Ezekiel's first vision, which it much resembles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that King Uzziah died.</span> The year <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>, probably. We cannot determine from the phrase used whether the vision was seen before or after Uzziah's death. <span class="cmt_word">I saw also</span>; rather, <span class="accented">then it was that I saw</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-6.htm">Exodus 16:6</a>). The Lord. Not "Jehovah," as in vers. 3 and 5, but "Adonay," for greater reverence. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up.</span> The imagery is, of course, taken from the practice of earthly kings. Elaborate thrones were affected by the great monarchs of Egypt and Assyria (Lepsius, 'Deutmaler,' pt. 3. pls. 2, 76, 100, 121; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 150). Solomon's throne was perhaps even grander than any of these (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>). It was placed at the summit of "<span class="accented">six</span> steps," so that its occupant was "<span class="accented">high</span> and lifted up" above all his courtiers. <span class="cmt_word">His train.</span> Not his train of attendants, but "the skirts of his robe." Flowing robes were commonly worn by great monarchs. <span class="cmt_word">Filled the temple</span>; or, <span class="accented">the palace</span>. The same word is used in Hebrew for both. Dr. Kay supposes the prophet to be "in vision gazing on the actual temple - to see its veils drawn aside, and instead of the Shechinah enthroned on the cherubim, to behold the King of glory, enthroned on high, the fringes of his royal robe filling the temple, so that no human priest could minister there." But, as Mr. Cheyne observes, "palace is more in harmony with the picture than temple." It is the heavenly palace of the King of kings into which the prophet's gaze is allowed to penetrate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 In this figurative vision, the temple is thrown open to view, even to the most holy place. The prophet, standing outside the temple, sees the Divine Presence seated on the mercy-seat, raised over the ark of the covenant, between the cherubim and seraphim, and the Divine glory filled the whole temple. See God upon his throne. This vision is explained, Joh 12:41, that Isaiah now saw Christ's glory, and spake of Him, which is a full proof that our Saviour is God. In Christ Jesus, God is seated on a throne of grace; and through him the way into the holiest is laid open. See God's temple, his church on earth, filled with his glory. His train, the skirts of his robes, filled the temple, the whole world, for it is all God's temple. And yet he dwells in every contrite heart. See the blessed attendants by whom his government is served. Above the throne stood the holy angels, called seraphim, which means burners; they burn in love to God, and zeal for his glory against sin. The seraphim showing their faces veiled, declares that they are ready to yield obedience to all God's commands, though they do not understand the secret reasons of his counsels, government, or promises. All vain-glory, ambition, ignorance, and pride, would be done away by one view of Christ in his glory. This awful vision of the Divine Majesty overwhelmed the prophet with a sense of his own vileness. We are undone if there is not a Mediator between us and this holy God. A glimpse of heavenly glory is enough to convince us that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Nor is there a man that would dare to speak to the Lord, if he saw the justice, holiness, and majesty of God, without discerning his glorious mercy and grace in Jesus Christ. The live coal may denote the assurance given to the prophet, of pardon, and acceptance in his work, through the atonement of Christ. Nothing is powerful to cleanse and comfort the soul, but what is taken from Christ's satisfaction and intercession. The taking away sin is necessary to our speaking with confidence and comfort, either to God in prayer, or from God in preaching; and those shall have their sin taken away who complain of it as a burden, and see themselves in danger of being undone by it. It is great comfort to those whom God sends, that they go for God, and may therefore speak in his name, assured that he will bear them out.</body></html>
