A certain small number - Daniel and the Three Children - were advanced to positions of importance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48, 49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-30.htm">Daniel 3:30</a>), and, on the whole, well treated. On the other hand, Jehoiachin underwent an imprisonment of thirty-seven years' duration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Mr. Cheyne says that "the writings of Jeremiah and Ezekiel do not suggest that the [bulk of the] exiles were great sufferers." This is, no doubt, true; and we may, perhaps, regard Isaiah's words in this place as sufficiently made good by the "cruelties which disfigured the first days of the Babylonian triumph" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-12.htm">Lamentations 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). Still, there may well have been a large amount of suffering among the rank-and-file of the captives, of which no historic record has come down to us. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138.htm">Psalm 138</a>. reveals some of the bitter feelings of the exiles. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the ancient</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon the aged.</span> The author of Chronicles notes that Nebuchadnezzar, on taking Jerusalem, "had no compassion on young man or maiden, old man or him that stooped for age" (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). There is no reason for giving the words of the present passage an allegorical meaning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-6 Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deep distress. She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.</body></html>
