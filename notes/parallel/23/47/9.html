The day of the capture of the city by Cyrus, which was the third of Marchesvan, <span class="date">B.C. 539</span>. Then, "in a moment," Babylon lost the whole of her prestige, ceased to reign, ceased to be an independent power, became a "widow," had a portion of her population turn from her, was brought down to the dust. Loss of children, and widowhood came upon her in their perfection<span class="cmt_word">;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. "</span>in the full extent of their bitterness" (Cheyne). Not that Cyrus imitated her common practice by carrying off her entire population; on the contrary, she continued for more than two centuries to be a flourishing and populous town. Twice she revolted from Darius Hystaspis ('Beh. Ins.,' col. 1. par. 16; col 3, par. 13), once, perhaps, from Xerxes (Ctes., 'Ext. Pers,' &sect; 22). Alexander the Great found her walls and her great buildings in ruins, but still she was a considerable place. Cyrus, however, no doubt, carried off a portion of her population, which thenceforth begun to dwindle, and continually became less and less as time went on, until she sank into a solitude. That extreme desolation which the prophets paint in such vivid colours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>:19-22; 14:22, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-10.htm">Jeremiah 50:10</a>:15, 38-40; 2:36-43) was potentially contained in the capture by Cyrus, which was the work of a single day. <span class="cmt_word">For the multitude of thy sorceries... of thine enchantments</span> (comp. ver. 13; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>). The word here translated "sorceries" probably means "incantations" or "enchantments," while that translated "enchantments" means "spells." The addiction of the Babylonians to marc is largely attested by the classical writers, and has been proved beyond a doubt by the lately discovered native remains. By these it appears that their magic fell under three principal heads: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the preparation and use of spells and talismans, which were written forms engraved on stone or impressed on clay, and worn on the person or attached to the object on which their influence was to be exerted; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the composition and recitation of formulae of incantation, which were supposed to act as charms, and to drive away demons and diseases; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the taking of observations and framing of tables of prognostics and of omens for general use, together with the casting of horoscopes for the special advantage of individuals (see Rawlinson's 'Egypt and Babylon,' p. 58; and comp. Lenor, mant,'La Magic chez les Chaldaens,' and Professor Sayce's papers in the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 3:p. 145, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>; vol. 4:p. 302, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>). The first and second forms of marc are glanced at in the present passage; the third is noticed in ver. 13. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:7-15 Let us beware of acting and speaking as Babylon did; of trusting in tyranny and oppression; of boasting as to our abilities, relying on ourselves, and ascribing success to our own prudence and wisdom; lest we partake of her plagues. Those in the height of prosperity, are apt to fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity. It is also common for sinners to think they shall be safe, because they think to be secret in wicked ways. But their security shall be their ruin. Let us draw from such passages as the foregoing, those lessons of humility and trust in God which they convey. If we believe the word of God, we may know how it will be with the righteous and the wicked to all eternity. We may learn how to escape the wrath to come, to glorify God, to have peace through life, hope in death, and everlasting happiness. Let us then stand aloof from all delusions.</body></html>
