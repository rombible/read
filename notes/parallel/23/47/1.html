The song divides itself into four strophes, or stanzas - the first one of four verses (vers. 1-4); the second of three (vers. 5-7); the third of four (Vers. 8-11); and the fourth also of four (vers. 12-15). The speaker is either Jehovah (see ver. 3, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>) or "a chorus of celestial beings" (Cheyne), bent on expressing their sympathy with Israel <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">Come down, and sit in the dust;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "descend to the lowest depth of humiliation" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a><span class="cmt_word">). O virgin daughter of Babylon</span>. The "virgin daughter of Babylon" is the Babylonian <span class="accented">people</span> as distinct from the city (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>). "Virgin" does not mean "unconquered;" for Babylon had been taken by the Assyrians some half-dozen times ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, pp. 58, 130, 149, 157, 164, 175, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sit on the ground</span>: there is no throne; rather, <span class="accented">sit on the ground throneless</span>, or <span class="accented">without a throne.</span> Hitherto the "virgin daughter" had sat, as it were, on a throne, ruling the nations. Now she must sit on the ground - there was no throne left for her. It is the fact that Babylon was never, after her capture by Cyrus, the capital. of a kingdom. Under the Achsemenian kings she was the residence of the court for a part of the year; but Susa was the capital. Under Alexander she was designated for his capital; but he died before his designs could be carried out. Under the Seleucidae she rapidly dwindled in consequence, until she became a ruin. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be called tender and</span> <span class="cmt_word">delicate;</span> or, <span class="accented">delicate and luxurious</span> (Cheyne). Babylon had hitherto been one of the chief seats of Oriental luxury. She was "the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>), "the golden city" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>). She was given to revelry and feasting, to mirth and drunkenness, to a shameless licensed debauchery (Herod., 1. 199; Baruch 6:43). All this would now be changed. Her population would have to perform the hard duties laid upon them by foreign masters. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-6 Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deep distress. She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.</body></html>
