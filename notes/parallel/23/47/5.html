The fallen people is recommended to hide its shame in silence and darkness, as disgraced persons do who shrink from being seen by their fellows. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be called The lady of kingdoms.</span> Babylon can scarcely have borne this title in Isaiah's time, or at any earlier period, unless it were a <span class="accented">very</span> remote one. She had been secondary to Assyria for at least six hundred years when Isaiah wrote, and under Sennacherib was ruled by viceroys of his appointment. But Isaiah's prophetic foresight enables him to realize the later period of Babylon's prosperity and glory under Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar, when she became the inheritress of the greatness of Assyria, and exercised rule over a large portion of Western Asia. Nebuchadnezzar was, no doubt, as he is called by both Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a>) and Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37</a>), a "king of kings;" and Babylon was then an empress-state, exercising authority over many minor kingdoms. It is clear that, both in the earlier and the later chapters, the prophet realizes this condition of things (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4-6, 12-17</a>; as well as the present passage). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-6 Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deep distress. She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.</body></html>
