As such it finds a parallel in the overthrow of the mystical Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm" title="Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.">Revelation 18:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Sit thou silent.</span>--Another contrast between the stir of the rejoicing city and the stillness of its later desolation.

It is certainly quite unlike anything else in the song, which would artistically be improved by its removal. If, however, it be retained, we must regard it as a parenthetic ejaculation of the Jewish Church on hearing the first strophe of the song - the Church contrasting itself with Babylon, which has no one to stand up for it, whereas it has as "Redeemer the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:1-6 Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deep distress. She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.</body></html>
