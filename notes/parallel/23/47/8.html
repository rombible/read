She practically deified herself. So a like boast is put into the mouth of Nineveh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-15.htm" title="This is the rejoicing city that dwelled carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passes by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.">Zephaniah 2:15</a>, and was repeated almost verbally by the poets of Rome: <span class= "ital">Terrarum dea gentiumque Roma, cui par est nihil, et nihil secundum </span>(Martial).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and now.</span> The third strophe begins here, but with a single, instead of a double, imperative.

Herodotus says that, when Cyrus invested the city, the inhabitants "made light of his siege" (1:190), and occupied themselves "in dancing and revelry" (1:191). The Nabonidus Tablet seems to show that very slight and insufficient preparations for defence were made.! am, and none else <span class="cmt_word">Beside me.</span> This is not self-deification, but only a boast of superiority to all other earthly powers. Zephaniah expresses in exactly similar terms the pride and arrogance of Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>).

Those in the height of prosperity, are apt to fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity. It is also common for sinners to think they shall be safe, because they think to be secret in wicked ways. But their security shall be their ruin. Let us draw from such passages as the foregoing, those lessons of humility and trust in God which they convey. If we believe the word of God, we may know how it will be with the righteous and the wicked to all eternity. We may learn how to escape the wrath to come, to glorify God, to have peace through life, hope in death, and everlasting happiness. Let us then stand aloof from all delusions.</body></html>
