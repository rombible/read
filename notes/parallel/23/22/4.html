It is too deep for visits of consolation. He "refuses to be comforted." Isaiah bewails the destruction of "the daughter of his people" in much the same strain as that of Jeremiah over a later catastrophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-48.htm" title="My eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.">Lamentations 3:48</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore said I.</span> The prophet turns from the description of the scene before him to an account of his own feelings. <span class="cmt_word">Look away from me, he says</span>; "leave me free to vent my sorrow without restraint; I wish for no consolation - only leave me to myself." <span class="cmt_word">Because of the spoiling</span>. The word used sometimes means" destruction;" but" spoiling" is a better rendering here. Sennacherib describes his "spoiling" of Jerusalem on this occasion as follows: "Thirty talents of gold, eight hundred talents of silver, precious carbuncles, great... stones, couches of ivory, lofty thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, weapons, everything, a great treasure, and his daughters, the eunuchs of his palace, male musicians, and female musicians, to Nineveh, the city of my dominion, did Hezekiah send after me" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 29-37). To what straits Hezekiah was reduced in order to collect a sufficient amount of the precious metals we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15, 16</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-7 Why is Jerusalem in such terror? Her slain men are not slain with the sword, but with famine; or, slain with fear, disheartened. Their rulers fled, but were overtaken. The servants of God, who foresee and warn sinners of coming miseries, are affected by the prospect. But all the horrors of a city taken by storm, faintly shadow forth the terrors of the day of wrath.</body></html>
