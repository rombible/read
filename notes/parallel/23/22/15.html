The word for "treasurer" (literally, <span class= "ital">companion</span>) implies a position like that of a vizier, identical, probably, with that of the "king's friend" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-26.htm" title="Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.">Genesis 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-37.htm" title="So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.">2Samuel 15:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1Kings 4:5</a>. In addition to this office Shebna had the position of being <span class= "ital">"</span>over the house," an office, like that of a Lord Chamberlain, of such importance that it was sometimes held by a king's son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-21.htm" title="And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelled in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.">2Chronicles 26:21</a>). It gave him supreme control over the treasury of the king and the internal affairs of his kingdom, and made him almost like a <span class= "ital">maire du palais </span>under the Merovingian kings. It is obvious that his influence was exercised to thwart the prophet's counsels; and the probable sequence of thought connecting the two sections is that he was prominent as the representative of the false security and luxury which the prophet had condemned; probably also of the party which rested their hope on an alliance with Egypt. What follows seems to show that he was a <span class= "ital">novus homo, </span>with no ancestral dignities in his house, possibly even a foreigner (the name is Aramaean in form), pushing himself forward with an obtrusive ambition. We note the touch of scorn in "<span class= "ital">this </span>Shebna."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-24.</span> - PROPHECY ON THE DEPOSITION OF SHEBNA AND THE ELEVATION OF ELIAKIM. In its first and simplest application, this section predicts the fall of one state official and the advancement of an-other - matters, no doubt, of some importance in the court history of the time, but scarcely (with reverence be it said) of such moment as to be worthy either of prophetic announcement or of divinely inspired record. It has, therefore, been generally felt that there must be a secondary application of the passage. According to some, the two officials represent respectively the two cove-hunts, the old and the new; according to others, they stand for the two great parties in the Jewish slate of the time - that which put its trust in Jehovah, and that which leant upon heathen alliances. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of hosts</span>. This form, <span class="accented">Adonay Jehovah Tsabaoth - rarely</span> used by Isaiah, but occurring above in vers. 5, 12, and 13 - seems to show that this section is in its right place, being intended as a sequel to the description of Sennacherib's siege. <span class="cmt_word">This treasurer</span>. The word "<span class="accented">this"</span> is contemptuous. That translated "treasurer" is of doubtful import. The key to it is probably to be found in the cognate noun, translated "storehouse" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, and "store" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>.

The name, which is not found elsewhere, is thought to be Syriac rather than Hebrew, and Shebna himself is conjectured to have been a foreign adventurer, perhaps "a refugee from Damascus" (Cheyne).

At this time it seems to have been the highest office that a subject could hold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-25 This message to Shebna is a reproof of his pride, vanity, and security; what vanity is all earthly grandeur, which death will so soon end! What will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificent tomb, or covered with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn and toss others, will be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakim should be put into Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust and power, should seek to God for grace to enable them to do their duty. Eliakim's advancement is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator, Re 3:7, that he has the key of David. His power in the kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that kingdom, is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their government; and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety and usefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them by their names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no real worth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon drop from him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all his family are said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of large spikes were built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables and utensils were hung. Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. That soul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to the ground, which is by faith hung upon Christ. He will set before the believer an open door, which no man can shut, and bring both body and soul to eternal glory. But those who neglect so great salvation will find, that when he shutteth none can open, whether it be shutting out from heaven, or shutting up in hell for ever.</body></html>
