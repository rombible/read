Not without a touch of irony, as the sequel shows, the prophet paints the extent to which those who belong to Eliakim will hang upon his support. There will be the "glory" or the "weight" (the Hebrew word has both meanings) of his next-of-kin. Besides these there will be the remoter <span class= "ital">off-shoots </span>and <span class= "ital">side-shoots </span>of his family. But the number will increase, and upon that single nail, or peg, would hang the "vessels of small quantity," cups such as were used by the priests for the blood of the victims in sacrificing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm" title="And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.">Exodus 24:6</a>), or for wine in common use (Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-2.htm" title="Your navel is like a round goblet, which wants not liquor: your belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.">Song of Solomon 7:2</a>), flagons, or earthen pitchers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm" title="And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.">Isaiah 30:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm" title="The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!">Lamentations 4:2</a>, i.e., the whole crowd of the retainers of a great official. The prophet obviously paints the picture as a warning. There was the danger even for Eliakim, upright and religious as he was, as there has been for others like him, of giving way to nepotism, and the fault would not remain unpunished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the glory</span>.

And Christ's glory in his final kingdom will consist greatly in the number of the saved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The offspring and the issue</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flourishing scions, and the despised seedlings alike. The word translated "issue" is a term of contempt (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the vessels of cups</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of bowls</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To all the vessels of flagons</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of pitchers</span>. "A numerous, undistinguished, family connection" seems to be intended (Delitzsch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-25 This message to Shebna is a reproof of his pride, vanity, and security; what vanity is all earthly grandeur, which death will so soon end! What will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificent tomb, or covered with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn and toss others, will be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakim should be put into Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust and power, should seek to God for grace to enable them to do their duty. Eliakim's advancement is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator, Re 3:7, that he has the key of David. His power in the kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that kingdom, is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their government; and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety and usefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them by their names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no real worth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon drop from him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all his family are said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of large spikes were built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables and utensils were hung. Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. That soul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to the ground, which is by faith hung upon Christ. He will set before the believer an open door, which no man can shut, and bring both body and soul to eternal glory. But those who neglect so great salvation will find, that when he shutteth none can open, whether it be shutting out from heaven, or shutting up in hell for ever.</body></html>
