Here, as in the case of Shebna, we have no record of the fulfilment of the prediction, but it is a natural inference, from its remaining in the collected prophecies of Isaiah, either that it was fulfilled, or that it did its work as a warning, and that the penalty was averted by a timely reformation.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - SEQUEL OF THE PROPHECY CONCERNING ELIAKIM. This verse has been truly called "an enigma" (Kay). It is impossible to understand it of Shebna. "The nail that was fastened in a sure place" can only refer to the nail said to have been so fastened in ver. 23. Are we, then, to understand that Eliakim too will experience a reverse of fortune? But then all the force of the contrast between him and Shebna would be gone. Is it not possible that the prophet, seeing in Eliakim a type of the Messiah, and becoming more and more Messianic in his utterances, has ended by forgetting the type altogether, and being absorbed in the thought of the antitype? He, the nail, so surely fixed in his eternal place, would nevertheless be "removed" for a time, and then "he cut down and fall" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>). At the same time would be "cut off" the burden which Messiah bore (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, "He bare the sin of many"). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. Not the day of Shebna's fall, certainly (ver. 20), but some ether. Is not the day that of Christ's earthly mission, when it seemed as if his people were about to acknowledge him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-40</a>), and his throne to be established, but suddenly Messiah was "cut off" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>) - stricken for the transgression of his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">The burden that was upon it shall be cut off.</span> The great burden upon the Messiah was the load of human sin which he had to bear. "He himself bare our sins in his own body on the tree" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). By his death this burden was "cut off" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath spoken it.</span> The double attestation, at the beginning and at the end of the verse, is a mark of the vast importance of the announcement contained in it, which <span class="accented">is</span>, in fact, the germ of the great doctrine of the atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-25 This message to Shebna is a reproof of his pride, vanity, and security; what vanity is all earthly grandeur, which death will so soon end! What will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificent tomb, or covered with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn and toss others, will be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakim should be put into Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust and power, should seek to God for grace to enable them to do their duty. Eliakim's advancement is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator, Re 3:7, that he has the key of David. His power in the kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that kingdom, is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their government; and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety and usefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them by their names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no real worth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon drop from him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all his family are said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of large spikes were built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables and utensils were hung. Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. That soul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to the ground, which is by faith hung upon Christ. He will set before the believer an open door, which no man can shut, and bring both body and soul to eternal glory. But those who neglect so great salvation will find, that when he shutteth none can open, whether it be shutting out from heaven, or shutting up in hell for ever.</body></html>
