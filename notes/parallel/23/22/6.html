Elam, previously named as the destroyer of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm" title="A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.">Isaiah 21:2</a>), was at this time, as the inscriptions of Sargon show, subject to Assyria (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 29). As in later history (Herod. i. 73, iii. 21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-35.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.">Jeremiah 49:35</a>), it was conspicuous chiefly for its archers. "Kir," named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-11.htm" title="And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.">2Kings 16:11</a> as the region to which Tiglath-pileser carried off the people of Damascus, has been identified with the region near the river Kyros, the modern Georgia. There are, however, both linguistic and historical grounds against this identification, and we must be content to look on it as an otherwise unknown region of Mesopotamia. To "uncover the shield" was to draw it out of its leather case (comp. "<span class= "ital">Scutis tegumenta detrahere"</span>; Caes. <span class= "ital">Bell. Gall. </span>2:21), and so to be prepared for battle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elam bare the quiver</span>. Elam, the country extending from the Zagros range to the Lower Tigris, and watered by the Choaspes, Eulaeus, Pasitigris, and other rivers, was an independent kingdom from a very early date (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1, 9</a>), and in Isaiah's time was generally hostile to Assyria. Sargon, however, relates that he conquered a portion of the country, planted colonies in it from the more western parts of his empire, and placed both colonists and natives under the governor of Babylon ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 16). It is thus quite possible that both Sargon and Sennacherib may have had a contingent of Elamites in their armies. <span class="cmt_word">With chariots of men and horsemen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with troops of men</span> (<span class="accented">who were</span>) <span class="accented">horsemen</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>). Kir uncovered the shield. "Kir" is mentioned in 2 Kings as the place to which Tiglath-Pileser transported the inhabitants of Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>), and by Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>) as the original country from which the Syrians were derived. It has been recently identified with Kirkhi, near Diarbekr, or with Kirruri, in the Urumiyah country (Cheyne); but neither identification is marc than possible. (On uncovering shields as a preliminary to engaging in battle, see Caesar, 'Do Bell. Gall.,' 2:21.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-7 Why is Jerusalem in such terror? Her slain men are not slain with the sword, but with famine; or, slain with fear, disheartened. Their rulers fled, but were overtaken. The servants of God, who foresee and warn sinners of coming miseries, are affected by the prospect. But all the horrors of a city taken by storm, faintly shadow forth the terrors of the day of wrath.</body></html>
