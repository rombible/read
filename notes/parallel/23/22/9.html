Its object was to stop the outflow of the streams, and gather them into a reservoir, partly, of course, for the supply of the inhabitants during the siege, but still more that the Assyrian armies might find little or no water in the immediate neighbourhood of the city. Sargon, in his inscriptions, describes like preparations at Ashdod (Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyr.

"The city of David" may be here a name for Jerusalem generally, as "the city where David dwelt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>), or it may designate the eastern hill, where David fixed his residence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15, 16, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> we read that Hezekiah at this time "built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Mille in <span class="accented">the city of David</span>," where a particular part of Jerusalem seems certainly to be meant. <span class="cmt_word">Ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</span> The arrangements made by Hezekiah with respect to the water-supply at the time of Sennacherib's invasion, seem to have been the following: He found on the north of the city, where the Assyrian attack was certain to be delivered, in the vicinity of the Damascus gate, a pool or reservoir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>), fed by a conduit from some natural source, which lay open and patent to view. The superfluous water ran off from it by a "brook" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-4.htm">2 Chronicles 32:4</a>), which passed down the Tyropoeon valley, and joined the Kedron to the southeast of Ophel. His first step was to cover over and conceal the open reservoir, and also the" brook" which ran from it, at least as far as the northern city wall, to prevent their use by the Assyrians. He then further made a conduit underground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>) within the city, along the Tyropoeon depression, to a second reservoir, or "pool," also within the city, which could be freely used by the inhabitants (see ver. 11; and comp. Ecclus. 48:17). Further, it is probable that he carried a conduit from this second pool, under the temple area, to the" fount of the Virgin" on the eastern side of Ophel, and thence further conveyed the water by a tunnel through Ophel to the "pool of Siloam." (This last may be the work here alluded to.) The inscription recently discovered at this peel is probably of Hezekiah's time (see 'Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for April, 1881, p. 70). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:8-14 The weakness of Judah now appeared more than ever. Now also they discovered their carnal confidence and their carnal security. They looked to the fortifications. They made sure of water for the city. But they were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did not care for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for a blessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what God makes it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. There was great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them. God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. They walked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this, is at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, which are the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind. God was displeased at this. It is a sin against the remedy, and it is not likely they should ever repent of it. Whether this unbelief works by presumption or despair, it produces the same contempt of God, and is a token that a man will perish wilfully.</body></html>
