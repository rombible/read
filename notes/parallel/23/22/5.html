In the latter we hear the actual crash of the battering-rams across the walls. The cry of the panic-stricken people shall rise to the surrounding mountains, possibly as to the hills from whence they expected help, either as true worshippers looking to Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm" title="I will lift up my eyes to the hills, from where comes my help.">Psalm 121:1</a>), or to the high places which were so long the objects of their worship, and which led their enemies to say that their gods were "gods of the hills, and not of the valleys" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-23.htm" title="And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.">1Kings 20:23</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is a day...

God has in reserve such a day; and it will assuredly arrive in due course. Hence the prophet's grief. <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of vision</span>. We may suppose that Hezekiah, before he made the submission recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a> and in the 'Cylinder of Sennacherib,' col. 4:11. 28, 29, tried the chances of battle against the Assyrians <span class="accented">in this valley</span>, and that Isaiah had a prophetic vision of the fight. <span class="cmt_word">Breaking down the walls</span>; rather, <span class="accented">undermining</span>. The Assyrian sculptures show numerous examples of this practice. Sometimes swords or spears are used to dislodge the stones of the wall, sometimes crow-bars or axes (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 82). <span class="cmt_word">Crying</span>. Some regard this word, and also that translated "the walls" in the preceding clause, as proper names, and render the passage, "Kir undermineth, and Shoa is at the mount" (Ewald, Cheyne, Luzzatto). But it seems unlikely that "Kit" would be mentioned twice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-7 Why is Jerusalem in such terror? Her slain men are not slain with the sword, but with famine; or, slain with fear, disheartened. Their rulers fled, but were overtaken. The servants of God, who foresee and warn sinners of coming miseries, are affected by the prospect. But all the horrors of a city taken by storm, faintly shadow forth the terrors of the day of wrath.</body></html>
