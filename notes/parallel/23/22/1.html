If we think of the prophet's dwelling as being in the lower city, in the valley of Tyrop?on, the epithet becomes still more appropriate. That valley would be to him in very deed a "valley of vision," where he saw things present and to come. Possibly the name became more characteristic from the impulse given to the prophetic dreams of all who claimed to be seers. The prophet looks out, and sees the people in a state of excitement, caused probably by the near approach of the Assyrian armies. They are "on the house-tops," the flat roofs of which were a customary place of concourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-27.htm" title="Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.">Judges 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm" title="So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.">Nehemiah 8:16</a>), keeping their revels, as those do who meet the approach of danger with a reckless despair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm" title="And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.">Isaiah 22:13</a>). By some commentators (Birks, Kay,) the "valley of vision" has been identified with Samaria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - A PROPHECY AGAINST JERUSALEM. The prophet, present in Jerusalem, either actually, or at any rate in spirit, <span class="accented">sees</span> the inhabitants crowded together upon the housetops, in a state of boisterous merriment (vers. 1, 2). Outside the walls is a foreign army threatening the town (vers. 5-7). Preparations have been made for resistance, which are described (vers. 8-11); but there has been no turning to God. On the contrary, the danger has but made the bulk of the people reckless. Instead of humbling themselves and putting on sackcloth, and weeping, and appealing to God's mercy, they have determined to drown care in drink and sensual enjoyment (vers. 12, 13). Therefore the prophet is bidden to denounce woe upon them, and threaten that Jehovah will not forgive their recklessness until their death (ver. 14). There is nothing to mark very distinctly the nationality of the foreign army; but it is certainly represented as made up of contingents from many nations. Delitzsch holds that the Assyrian armies were never so made up, or, at any rate, that the nations here mentioned never served in its ranks ('Site of Paradise,' p. 237); but this is, perhaps, assuming that our knowledge on the subject is more complete and exact than is really the case. It is almost impossible to imagine any other army than the Assyrian besieging Jerusalem in Isaiah's time. Moreover, the particulars concerning the preparations made against the enemy (vers. 9-11) agree with those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3-5</a> and 30 as made by Hezekiah against Sennacherib. And the second section of the chapter has certainly reference to this period. It seems, therefore, reasonable to regard the siege intended as that conducted by Sennacherib in his fourth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), of which we have a brief account in his annals (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, 11. 15-18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The burden of the valley of vision</span>. "The valley of vision" is only mentioned here and in ver. 5. It must have been one of the deep depressions near Jerusalem troll which there is a good view of the town. The LXX. render, "the burden of the valley of <span class="accented">Zion</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>What aileth thee now</span>? Jerusalem is addressed by the prophet, who assumes the <span class="accented">role</span> of a spectator, surprised at what he <span class="accented">sees</span>, and <span class="accented">asks</span> an explanation. <span class="cmt_word">That thou art wholly gone up to the housetops</span>. Partly, no doubt, they went to watch the enemy and his movements, as Rosenm&uuml;ller says; but still more for feasting and revelry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-27.htm">Judges 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>). The flat roofs of Oriental houses are often used as places of recreation and entertainment, especially in the evening (Shaw, 'Travels,' p. 211; Chardin, 'Voyages en Perse,' vol. 4. p. 116; Layard, 'Nineveh,' vol. 1. p. 177, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-7 Why is Jerusalem in such terror? Her slain men are not slain with the sword, but with famine; or, slain with fear, disheartened. Their rulers fled, but were overtaken. The servants of God, who foresee and warn sinners of coming miseries, are affected by the prospect. But all the horrors of a city taken by storm, faintly shadow forth the terrors of the day of wrath.</body></html>
