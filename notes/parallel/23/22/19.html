Such changes, however, are common enough in Hebrew prophetic speech (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm" title="Why it shall come to pass, that when the Lord has performed his whole work on mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-13.htm" title="The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yes, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.">Isaiah 42:13-14</a>), and Jehovah is the subject of both clauses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will drive thee from thy station</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from thy post</span>, or <span class="accented">office</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall he pull thee down</span>. Jehovah scorns to be meant in both clauses (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>). The full accomplishment of this prophecy is nowhere declared to us. We merely find that, by the time of Rabshakeh's arrival at Jerusalem as Sennacherib's envoy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2-4</a>), Shebna had lost his post as prefect of the palace, and filled the lower position of scribe or secretary. He may, however, have been subsequently further degraded, and thereupon he may have fled to Egypt, as Jeroboam did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-25 This message to Shebna is a reproof of his pride, vanity, and security; what vanity is all earthly grandeur, which death will so soon end! What will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificent tomb, or covered with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn and toss others, will be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakim should be put into Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust and power, should seek to God for grace to enable them to do their duty. Eliakim's advancement is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator, Re 3:7, that he has the key of David. His power in the kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that kingdom, is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their government; and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety and usefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them by their names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no real worth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon drop from him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all his family are said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of large spikes were built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables and utensils were hung. Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. That soul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to the ground, which is by faith hung upon Christ. He will set before the believer an open door, which no man can shut, and bring both body and soul to eternal glory. But those who neglect so great salvation will find, that when he shutteth none can open, whether it be shutting out from heaven, or shutting up in hell for ever.</body></html>
