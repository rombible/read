The houses were numbered that some might be pulled down and others left, as strategical plans might determine. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2Chronicles 32:5</a>.) So in what was probably a contemporary psalm we have, "Walk about Zion <span class= "bld">. . .</span> tell the towers thereof <span class= "bld">. . .</span> mark ye well her bulwarks" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-12.htm" title="Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.">Psalm 48:12</a>). So in the later siege of Jerusalem houses were thrown down by (or, more accurately, <span class= "ital">on account of</span>) the mounds that were employed by the besiegers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;">Jeremiah 33:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have numbered... have broken down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye numbered</span>... <span class="accented">ye broke down</span>. The "numbering" was probably in order to see how many could be spared for pulling down. The repair of the walls with materials thus furnished was a sign of extreme haste and urgency. It would seem from vers. 7, 8 that the repairs were not begun until the town was invested. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:8-14 The weakness of Judah now appeared more than ever. Now also they discovered their carnal confidence and their carnal security. They looked to the fortifications. They made sure of water for the city. But they were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did not care for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for a blessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what God makes it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. There was great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them. God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. They walked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this, is at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, which are the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind. God was displeased at this. It is a sin against the remedy, and it is not likely they should ever repent of it. Whether this unbelief works by presumption or despair, it produces the same contempt of God, and is a token that a man will perish wilfully.</body></html>
