Such a sight constituted an earnest call upon the people for immediate repentance. <span class="cmt_word">Baldness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>). It has been said that "baldness" was forbidden by the Law (Cheyne); but this is not so, absolutely. Baldness was wholly forbidden to the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a>); and certain peculiar modes of shaving the hair, the beard, and the eyebrows, practiced by idolatrous nations, were prohibited to all the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>). But such shaving of the head as was practiced by Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>) and other pious men, was not forbidden to laymen, any more than the wearing of sackcloth. It was regarded as a natural mode of exhibiting grief. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:8-14 The weakness of Judah now appeared more than ever. Now also they discovered their carnal confidence and their carnal security. They looked to the fortifications. They made sure of water for the city. But they were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did not care for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for a blessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what God makes it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. There was great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them. God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. They walked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this, is at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, which are the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind.
