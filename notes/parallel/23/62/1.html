Some regard the speaker in this chapter as Jehovah; some as the prophet, or the prophetical order; some as "the Servant." The last supposition appears to us the simplest and the best. The close connection with the preceding chapter is evident. If that then be, in the main, "a soliloquy of the Servant," this should he a continuation of the soliloquy. Israel is promised "righteousness," "glory," "a new name," a guard of angels, a time of peace and prosperity, deliverance from Babylon, and triumphant establishment in Zion under God's protection. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace</span>. In the past God has kept silence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>). "The Servant" has not caused his voice to be heard. Babylon has been allowed to continue her oppression unchecked. But now there will be a change. God will lift up his voice, and the nations will hear; and the "salvation" of Israel will be effected speedily. For Jerusalem's sake. "Zion" and "Jerusalem" are used throughout as synonyms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4, 5</a>, and 9; 33:20; 40:9; 41:27; 52:1; 64:10, etc.), like "Israel" and Jacob." Strictly speaking, "Zion" is the mountain, "Jerusalem" the city built upon it. Until the righteousness thereof go forth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10, 11</a>). As brightness; or, as <span class="accented">the dawn</span> (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Salvation... as a lamp that burneth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a torch that blazeth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2.htm">Nahum 2</a>:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-6.htm">Zechariah 12:6</a>). Israel's "salvation" would be made manifest; primarily by her triumphant return from Babylon, and more completely by her position in the final kingdom of the Redeemer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>62:1-5 The Son of God here assures his church of his unfailing love, and his pleading for her under all trails and difficulties. She shall be called by a new name, a pleasant name, such as she was never called by before. The state of true religion in the world, before the preaching of the gospel, no man seemed to have any real concern for. God, by his grace, has wrought that in his church, which makes her his delight. Let us thence learn motives to holiness. If the Lord rejoices over us, we should rejoice in his service.</body></html>
