The root-thought is that the altered state is to be embodied, as in the case of Abraham and Israel, in a new name. Here, however, the effect of the promise is heightened, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm" title="Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.">Revelation 3:12</a>, by the absence of the new 'name, as something which is to transcend all experience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/62.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Gentiles shall see</span>, etc. A continuation of the account of Israel's final glory, as given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6-9</a>. What the Gentiles are especially to see and admire is Israel's righteousness. This may point to those acknowledgments of the purity and excellence of the early Church which were made by the heathen (Plin., 'Epist.,' 10:97), and which culminated in the saying, "See how these Christians love one another!" The sceptic Gibbon acknowledges, among the causes of the success of Christianity, "the virtues of the early Christians." All kings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-22.htm">Psalm 50:22</a>:11). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called by a new name</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 12; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>). It is not altogether clear what the "new name" is, since in the remainder of the present chapter more than one name is suggested. Rosenmuller supposes" Hephzibah" to be meant. Dr. Kay suggests "the holy people," and notes that the title of "holy ones," or "saints," is given by St. Paul to all Christians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-15.htm">Romans 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>, etc.). Mr. Cheyne thinks that it is some unknown title of honour, akin to that mentioned by Jeremiah "Jehovah our Righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>). "New names" will be given to individual saints in the heavenly kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>62:1-5 The Son of God here assures his church of his unfailing love, and his pleading for her under all trails and difficulties. She shall be called by a new name, a pleasant name, such as she was never called by before. The state of true religion in the world, before the preaching of the gospel, no man seemed to have any real concern for. God, by his grace, has wrought that in his church, which makes her his delight. Let us thence learn motives to holiness. If the Lord rejoices over us, we should rejoice in his service.</body></html>
