In answer to the representations of the "remembrancers," God solemnly binds himself by an oath to come to the relief of the people, to restore them to their own land, and to give them the enjoyment of its fruits in peace. <span class="cmt_word">By his right hand</span>. God commonly swears "by himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>), or "by his holiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>). Once he swears "by his great Name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>), and once "by the excellency of Jacob" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>). There is no other place in Scripture where he swears "by his right hand and arm" - emblems of his power to act. <span class="cmt_word">Thy corn... thy wine;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fruits of thy land. Hitherto, even when Israel was in possession of Palestine, its fruits were constantly destroyed, or carried off, by the raids of hostile neighbours. Henceforth this plundering should cease. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>62:6-9 God's professing people must be a praying people. He is not displeased with us for being earnest, as men commonly are; he bids us to cry after him, and give him no rest, Lu 11:5,6. It is a sign that God is coming to a people in mercy, when he pours out a spirit of prayer upon them. See how uncertain our creature-comforts are. See also God's mercy in giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it. Let us delight in attending the courts of the Lord, that we may enjoy the consolations of his Spirit.</body></html>
