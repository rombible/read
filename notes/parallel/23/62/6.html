The prophets of the return from exile, Zechariah, Haggai, Malachi, may be thought of as representative examples of such "watchmen," as also are the prophets of the Christian Church, which takes partly, at least, the position of the new Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Ye that make mention . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">ye that are the remembrancers. </span>They are to remind Jehovah of His promises day and night, that He may hasten their fulfilment, never resting till the future Jerusalem is in very deed "a praise in the earth." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?">Zechariah 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/62.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set watchmen upon thy walls</span>. "The Servant" has appointed watchers upon the walls of Zion - either "prophets" (Delitzsch), or "priests and prophets" (Kay), or, more probably, "angelic beings" (Cheyne), who keep perpetual watch and ward (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>). Neither <span class="cmt_word">day nor night</span> do they <span class="cmt_word">hold their peace</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">keep silence</span>, but ever intercede with God for his people, like the "angel of Jehovah" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>, reminding him of his covenant with them, and his promises to them, and exhorting him to "awake, awake" for his own honour's sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9-11</a>). It is generally allowed that the "watchers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13, 17, 23</a> are angels; and the same interpretation best suits the "watchmen" of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Ye that make mention of the Lord</span>; rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">ye that are the Lord's remembrancers</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "ye whose business it is to call to God's remembrance the needs and claims of his people, and the obligations of his covenant promises." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>62:6-9 God's professing people must be a praying people. He is not displeased with us for being earnest, as men commonly are; he bids us to cry after him, and give him no rest, Lu 11:5,6. It is a sign that God is coming to a people in mercy, when he pours out a spirit of prayer upon them. See how uncertain our creature-comforts are. See also God's mercy in giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it. Let us delight in attending the courts of the Lord, that we may enjoy the consolations of his Spirit.</body></html>
