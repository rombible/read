The people, regarded as a female ("the virgin daughter of Zion," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>) is also married to Jehovah, and recognizes him as her Bridegroom (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>).

She shall be called by a new name, a pleasant name, such as she was never called by before. The state of true religion in the world, before the preaching of the gospel, no man seemed to have any real concern for. God, by his grace, has wrought that in his church, which makes her his delight. Let us thence learn motives to holiness. If the Lord rejoices over us, we should rejoice in his service.</body></html>
