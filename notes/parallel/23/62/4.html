And his mother's name was Hephzibah.">2Kings 21:1</a>), which, on the assumption of Isaiah's authorship of these chapters, would be fresh in the prophet's memory. It would be entirely after his manner to see in the bride's name, as in those of his own sons, an omen of the future. The fact that the Hebrew word for Forsaken (<span class= "ital">Azubah</span>) had been borne by a previous queen, the mother of Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-42.htm" title="Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.">1Kings 22:42</a>), confirms the view here taken. "Hephzi-bah" means "my delight is in her;" and "Beulah," "married."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/62.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken</span>. Judah had believed herself" forsaken" of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a>), and had actually been, in a certain sense, forsaken "for a small moment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>). Her enemies, it would seem, had gone so far as to give her the name in derision<span class="cmt_word">. Neither shall thy land ... be termed Desolate</span>. Judaea had not only been desolated by the Babylonian invaders under Nebucbarlnezzar, but had remained "desolate" during the whole period of the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a>, etc.). It had come to be spoken of as <span class="accented">Sh'marnah</span>, "a desolation" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Jeremiah 34:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-29.htm">Ezekiel 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>). Now all should be altered. As Ezekiel prophesied, "The land that was <span class="accented">desolate</span> is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my delight is in her." Hephzi-bah was the name of Hezekiah's queen, Manasseh's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy land Beulah</span>. Beulah, or rather Be'ulah, means "married" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>). Judaea would be "married" to her sons, or her people, when they quitted Babylon and once more took possession of her. The Hebrew verb toe "to marry" (as a man marries) means literally "to be lord over." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/62.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>62:1-5 The Son of God here assures his church of his unfailing love, and his pleading for her under all trails and difficulties. She shall be called by a new name, a pleasant name, such as she was never called by before. The state of true religion in the world, before the preaching of the gospel, no man seemed to have any real concern for. God, by his grace, has wrought that in his church, which makes her his delight. Let us thence learn motives to holiness. If the Lord rejoices over us, we should rejoice in his service.</body></html>
