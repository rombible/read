a reproach of men, and despised of the people.">Psalm 22:6</a>). He had not been chosen because he was a great and mighty nation, for Israel was <span class= "ital">"</span>the fewest of all people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-7.htm" title="The LORD did not set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people:">Deuteronomy 7:7</a>). As if to emphasise this, the prophet in addressing Israel passes from the masculine to the feminine, resuming the former in the second clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm" title="Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.">Isaiah 41:15</a>, where he speaks of its God-given strength.<p><span class= "bld">Thy redeemer . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">Goel </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-48.htm" title="After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brothers may redeem him:">Leviticus 25:48-49</a>, the next of kin, who was the protector, the deliverer, of his brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-43.htm" title="You shall not rule over him with rigor; but shall fear your God.">Leviticus 25:43-49</a>). Looking to the numerous traces of the influence of the Book of Job in 2 Isaiah, it seems not improbable that we have in these words an echo of the hope, <span class= "ital">"</span>I know that my Redeemer liveth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou worm Jacob</span>. Though in thyself the weakest of the weak, grovelling in the dust, a mere worm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a>), yet thou hast no cause to fear, since God sustains thee. <span class="cmt_word">Ye men of Israel</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye handful</span>, <span class="accented">Israel</span> (Delitzsch). The term used is one of disparagement, corresponding to the "worm" of the parallel clause. Few and weak though they be, God's people need not fear. <span class="cmt_word">Thy Redeemer</span>. The word <span class="accented">goel</span>, here used for the first time by Isaiah, is frequent throughout the later chapters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-17.htm">Isaiah 48:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). It is used for the "nearest of kin," and "avenger of blood," in the Levitical Law, but has a sense similar to that of the present passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>: 78:35: 103:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-11.htm">Proverbs 23:11</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>. The sense "redeem" belongs to the verb of which <span class="accented">goal</span> is the participle, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25, 33, 48, 49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-13.htm">Leviticus 27:13, 19, 21</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy One of Israel</span> Isaiah's favourite designation of the Almighty in his covenant relationship to Israel, used eleven times in the earlier chapters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1</a>:35.), once in the middle or historical portion, and thirteen times in the later chapters (Isaiah 40-66.); only used elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-22.htm">Psalm 71:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; and Psalm 51:5 (see Urwick, 'Servant of Jehovah,' pp. 36, 37). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:10-20 God speaks with tenderness; Fear thou not, for I am with thee: not only within call, but present with thee. Art thou weak? I will strengthen thee. Art thou in want of friends? I will help thee in the time of need. Art thou ready to fall? I will uphold thee with that the right hand which is full of righteousness, dealing forth rewards and punishments. There are those that strive with God's people, that seek their ruin. Let not God's people render evil for evil, but wait God's time. It is the worm Jacob; so little, so weak, so despised and trampled on by every body. God's people are as worms, in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, not of the serpent's seed. Every part of God's word is calculated to humble man's pride, and to make him appear little in his own eyes. The Lord will help them, for he is their Redeemer. The Lord will make Jacob to become a threshing instrument. God will make him fit for use, new, and having sharp spikes. This has fulfilment in the triumphs of the gospel of Christ, and of all faithful followers of Christ, over the power of darkness. God has provided comforts to supply all their wants, and to answer all their prayers. Our way to heaven lies through the wilderness of this world. The soul of man is in want, and seeks for satisfaction; but becomes weary of seeking that in the world, which is not to be had in it. Yet they shall have a constant supply, where one would least expect it. I will open rivers of grace, rivers of living water, which Christ spake of the Spirit, Joh 7:38,39. When God sets up his church in the Gentile wilderness, there shall be a great change, as if thorns and briers were turned into cedars, and fir-trees, and myrtles. These blessings are kept for the poor in spirit, who long for Divine enlightening, pardon, and holiness. And God will render their barren souls fruitful in the grace of his Spirit, that all who behold may consider it.</body></html>
