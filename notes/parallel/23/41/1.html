The nations will tremble, and seek the protection of their idol-deities (vers. 5-7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep silence before me, O islands</span>. God is the speaker. The "islands," or maritime lands of Western Asia, are to be silent before him, pondering the facts with a view to future argument. "Then let them speak" (see vers. 21-29). <span class="cmt_word">Let the people renew their strength</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the peoples</span> or <span class="accented">the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the inhabitants of the maritime tracts. To judgment; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to a discussion,, which shall terminate in a right verdict. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-9 Can any heathen god raise up one in righteousness, make what use of him he pleases, and make him victorious over the nations? The Lord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinners encourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of the living God stir up one another in his service? God's people are the seed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title ever given to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was made like to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy are the servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and to walk with him in faith and holy obedience. Let not such as have thus been favoured yield to fear; for the contest may be sharp, but the victory shall be sure.</body></html>
