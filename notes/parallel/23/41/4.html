and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>. The identical formula, "I am He" meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm" title="You are my witnesses, said the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-13.htm" title="Yes, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?">Isaiah 43:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-4.htm" title="And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.">Isaiah 46:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm" title="Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.">Isaiah 48:12</a>.

By "the First, and with the last" - a favourite phrase in these later chapters (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a> and Isaiah 48:12) - seems to be meant simply "the Eternal" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8, 11, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-9 Can any heathen god raise up one in righteousness, make what use of him he pleases, and make him victorious over the nations? The Lord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinners encourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of the living God stir up one another in his service? God's people are the seed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title ever given to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was made like to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy are the servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and to walk with him in faith and holy obedience. Let not such as have thus been favoured yield to fear; for the contest may be sharp, but the victory shall be sure.</body></html>
