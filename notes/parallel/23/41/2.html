The man so raised up to rule over the "islands" and the "peoples<span class= "ital">" </span>is none other than Koresh (Cyrus), the future restorer of Israel. The thought of Cyrus as working out the righteousness of God is dominant in these chapters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm" title="I the LORD have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-13.htm" title="I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 45:13</a>). In the rapidity of his conquest, the prophet bids men see the proof that he is doing God's work. So Jeremiah speaks of Nebuchadnezzar as the servant of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm" title="And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.">Jeremiah 27:6</a>). One may notice, if only to reject, the exposition of the Targum, followed by some commentators, which refers the verse to the call of Abraham and the victory of Genesis 14.<p><span class= "bld">He gave them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">He giveth them, </span>the future seen as present. The LXX. and some modern critics follow a reading which gives, <span class= "ital">he maketh them as dust, their sword as stubble.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who raised up the righteous man</span>, etc.? rather, <span class="accented">who raised up from the East one whom righteousness will call to his foot.</span> It is generally agreed among moderns that the reference is to Cyrus, who is further referred to in ver. 25, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-4, 13</a>; and Isaiah 46:11. Cyrus, whether we regard him as King of Persia, or as King of Elam (Susiana), would come from a land lying <span class="accented">east</span> of Babylon. "Righteousness called him to his foot" when God, the Righteous One, made him his minister, and gave him a certain task to perform (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gave the nations before him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">gives</span>, or <span class="accented">will give.</span> (On the rapid conquests of Cyrus, see Herod., 1:75-191; and comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 354-377.) That he was God's instrument must be admitted by all who allow that the course of history is determined by a superintending Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Made him rule over kings</span>. Mr. Cheyne translates, "makes him trample upon kings," which seems to give the true sense. It was certainly not the general policy of Cyrus to establish under him a number of subject kings, but rather to rule the conquered countries by means of Persian or Median governors (see Herod., 1:153, 156; 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 166) <span class="cmt_word">He gave them as the dust to his sword</span>, etc.; or, according to some, <span class="accented">he maketh their sword as dust</span>, <span class="accented">and their bow as driven stubble.</span> The result is the same, whichever we regard as the true construction. The prophecy tells of the ease and completeness with which Cyrus vanquished his enemies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-9 Can any heathen god raise up one in righteousness, make what use of him he pleases, and make him victorious over the nations? The Lord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinners encourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of the living God stir up one another in his service? God's people are the seed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title ever given to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was made like to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy are the servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and to walk with him in faith and holy obedience. Let not such as have thus been favoured yield to fear; for the contest may be sharp, but the victory shall be sure.</body></html>
