The idea embodied in the term is that of a calling and election, manifested now in Israel according to the flesh, now in the true Israel of God, realising its ideal, now, as in the innermost of the three concentric circles, in a person who gathers up that ideal in all its intensity into himself. The three phrases find their parallel in St. Paul's language as to (1) the seed of Abraham according to the flesh; (2) the true seed who are heirs of the faith of Abraham; (3) <span class= "ital">the </span>seed, which is none other than the Christ Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-7.htm" title="Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall your seed be called.">Romans 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>). Here we have the national aspect, Israel as he is in the idea of God. So in the later language of Christian thought we have (1) the visible Church falling short of the ideal; (2) the spiritual Church approximating to the ideal; (3) Christ Himself, as identified with His people.<p><span class= "bld">The seed of Abraham my friend.</span>--The word for "friend" implies loving as well as being loved.

The eye of the prophet travels perhaps, in part, beyond the period of the Captivity; but he is mainly bent on giving the people grounds of comfort and trust during that trying time. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel... my servant</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1, 2, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3-6</a>, etc.). The title characterizes these later chapters, and, while standing no doubt in some special relation to the "Servant of Jehovah" who is the subject of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5-7</a>, etc., is perhaps mainly selected, and dwelt on, to console Israel in captivity, when <span class="accented">servants</span> of the King of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-20.htm">2 Chronicles 36:20</a>), by the thought that their true Master was God himself, and that to him, and him only, did they really belong. <span class="cmt_word">Jacob whom I have chosen</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a>). (On this "choice," and the love which it implied, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>) Abraham my friend; or, <span class="accented">Abraham that loved me.</span> It was the special privilege of Abraham to be known as God's friend (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>) among the Hebrews, even as he is among the Arabs to this day. The "friendship" intended comprised, no doubt, both an active and a passive element, but it is the active element which the word principally enforces. Abraham loved God, and showed his love by his obedience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-9 Can any heathen god raise up one in righteousness, make what use of him he pleases, and make him victorious over the nations? The Lord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinners encourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of the living God stir up one another in his service? God's people are the seed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title ever given to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was made like to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy are the servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and to walk with him in faith and holy obedience. Let not such as have thus been favoured yield to fear; for the contest may be sharp, but the victory shall be sure.</body></html>
