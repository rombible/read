Can the false gods predict them as the pledge and earnest of predictions that go farther? Can they see a single year before them? We note that the challenge exactly corresponds to Isaiah's own method of giving "signs" that his words are not idly spoken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/7-10.htm" title="Moreover the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,">Isaiah 7:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/38-7.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken;">Isaiah 38:7-8</a>). The other meaning is maintained, however, by some critics as more in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-18.htm" title="Remember you not the former things, neither consider the things of old.">Isaiah 43:18</a>. The things "for to come" lie, as it were, in the middle future, the "hereafter" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-23.htm" title="Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.">Isaiah 41:23</a>, in the more remote.

God claims that the power of predicting the future is his own inalienable prerogative. He defies the idol-gods and their votaries to give any clear prediction of future events. No doubt the claim to possess the power was made very generally among the idolatrous nations, who almost universally practised divination, and in many case<span class="accented">s</span> possessed oracles. But it was a false claim, based upon fraud and cunning, which deceived men as often as dependence was placed upon it (Herod., 1:53, 91) and landed them in misfortune. <span class="cmt_word">The former things... things for to come.</span> Some commentators regard "the former things" as things actually past - "the beginnings of history, for instance, which to the heathen nations were wrapped in darkness" (Kay); but it seems better, on the whole, to understand (with Vitringa, Stier, Hahn, Cheyne, and Delitzsch) by "the former things" those in the immediate future, by "things for to come" those about to happen in remoter times. The former are, of course, much the easier to predict, since they fall to some extent within the domain of human foresight; the latter are more difficult; but the idol-gods are challenged to produce either the one or the other. <span class="cmt_word">What they be</span>. A definite and clear statement is required to preclude such vague and ambiguous utterances as the heathen oracles delighted to put forth. <span class="cmt_word">That we may consider them</span> (or, <span class="accented">lay them to heart</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and know the latter end of them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> compare them with the event, when the time comes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:21-29 There needs no more to show the folly of sin, than to bring to notice the reasons given in defence of it. There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this he will make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be only with Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except those of the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lord showed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon. The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hid from ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of nobler name and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews. May we be numbered among his obedient servants and faithful friends.</body></html>
