As the king of beasts stands haughtily defiant over the prey which he has made his own against the shepherds who seek to rob him of it, so will Jehovah, in His character as the Lord of hosts, refuse to surrender Jerusalem, His peculiar possession, to the armies of the Assyrians. (Comp. Homer<span class= "ital">, Il.,</span> 18:161.)<p><span class= "bld">To fight for Mount Zion.</span>--The preposition has been differently rendered as <span class= "ital">for, on, against. </span>The lion in the last case is claiming the sheep as his own prey, and will not suffer interference from without. Jehovah, using the Assyrian armies as His instruments, will fight against Jerusalem, and will not allow the Egyptian allies to interfere with His chastisements. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/29-7.htm" title="And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her fortification, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.">Isaiah 29:7-8</a>.) The second clause simply marks Jerusalem as the scene of the conflict, but agrees in substance with the first. Looking to the verse that follows, the idea of protection seems more natural than that of hostility. The thought of supreme ownership, however, includes both; Jerusalem belonged to Jehovah to protect or to chastise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - A PROMISE OF PROTECTION, AND OF THE DISCOMFITURE OF ASSYRIA. In the promise of protection (vers. 4, 5) there is nothing new but the imagery, which is of remarkable beauty. The promise is followed by a brief exhortation (vers. 6, 7); and then the discomfiture of Assyria is declared in the plainest terms, and her flight before the avenging sword of God (vers. 8, 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like as the lion</span>, etc. The resemblance of this simile to Hem., 'Iliad,' 18:11. 161, 162, has been often noticed. In both, the lion has seized his prey, and is crouching over it; the shepherds gather themselves together against him, and seek to scare him away; but he remains firm, undaunted by their threats and cries, never for a moment relinquishing the body of which he has made himself the master. The image is best explained as representing Jehovah, standing over and keeping guard on Jerusalem, which he will allow, no one to rend from him. <span class="cmt_word">And the young lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the young lion</span> (Lowth). A single animal must be intended. <span class="cmt_word">Roaring on his prey</span>; rather, <span class="accented">growleth over his prey</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so shall the Lord of hosts descend</span>, <span class="accented">to fight</span>, <span class="accented">on Mount Zion</span>. If we connect the concluding words of the clause with <span class="accented">tsaba</span>, to fight, the meaning must be "fight against," as Delitzsch shows conclusively. But we may connect them with the more distant <span class="accented">yered</span>, will descend, in which case they will mean "on," or "<span class="accented">upon</span> Mount Zion" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>). The best commentators are of opinion that this <span class="accented">must be</span> the sense. The words are a promise, not a threat. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-5 God will oppose the help sought from workers of iniquity. Sinners may be convicted of folly by plain and self-evident truths, which they cannot deny, but will not believe. There is no escaping the judgments of God; and evil pursues sinners. The Lord of hosts will come down to fight for Mount Zion. The Lion of the tribe of Judah will appear for the defence of his church. And as birds hovering over their young ones to protect them, with such compassion and affection will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem. He will so defend it, as to secure its safety.</body></html>
