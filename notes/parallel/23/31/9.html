The word <span class="accented">nes</span>, ensign, seems to be here used collectively. The Assyrian princes would tremble at every signal that they saw displayed along their line of route, expecting some enemy to fall upon them. <span class="cmt_word">His furnace.</span> Jehovah was at once a Light to his people, and "a consuming Fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>) to his enemies. His presence, indicated by the Shechinah in the holy of holies, was at once for blessing and for burning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:6-9 They have been backsliding children, yet children; let them return, and their backslidings shall be healed, though they have sunk deep into misery, and cannot easily recover. Many make an idol of their silver and gold, and by the love of that are drawn from God; but those who turn to God, will be ready to part with it. Then, when they have cast away their idols, shall the Assyrian fall by the sword of an angel, who strikes more strongly than a mighty man, yet more secretly than a mean man. God can make the stoutest heart to tremble. But if we keep up the fire of holy love and devotion in our hearts and houses, we may depend upon God to protect us and them.</body></html>
