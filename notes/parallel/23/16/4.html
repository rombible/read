The change of one accent will allow of this passage being translated, <span class="accented">Let the outcasts of Moab dwell with thee</span>; and so it is rendered by the LXX., the Syriac, by Lowth, Gesenius, Hitzig, Ewald, and Mr. Cheyne. Delitzsch and Dr. Kay agree with the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">For the extortioner is at an end</span>. This seems to be urged as a reason why the protection asked should be given: it will not be for long - the oppressor is about to receive chastisement. He is called "the extortioner," as exacting the utmost possible tribute from conquered lands. Such exaction was characteristic of Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; 'Assyrian Inscriptions,' <span class="accented">passim</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The spoiler ceaseth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">devastation ceaseth</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-5 God tells sinners what they may do to prevent ruin; so he does to Moab. Let them send the tribute they formerly engaged to pay to Judah. Take it as good advice. Break off thy sins by righteousness, it may lengthen thy quiet. And this may be applied to the great gospel duty of submission to Christ. Send him the lamb, the best you have, yourselves a living sacrifice. When you come to God, the great Ruler, come in the name of the Lamb, the Lamb of God. Those who will not submit to Christ, shall be as a bird that wanders from her nest, which shall be snatched up by the next bird of prey. Those who will not yield to the fear of God, shall be made to yield to the fear of every thing else. He advises them to be kind to the seed of Israel. Those that expect to find favour when in trouble themselves, must show favour to those in trouble. What is here said concerning the throne of Hezekiah, also belongs, in a much higher sense, to the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Though by subjection to Him we may not enjoy worldly riches or honours, but may be exposed to poverty and contempt, we shall have peace of conscience and eternal life.</body></html>
