The force of the contrast is emphasised, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm" title="And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.">Jeremiah 48:33</a> ("a cheer which is no cheer," Cheyne), by the use of the same word (<span class= "ital">hedad</span>) as that which in the next verse is employed for the song of those that tread the grapes. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm" title="Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar on his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.">Jeremiah 25:30</a>.) Possibly the word for "harvest" is used generically as including the vintage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I will bewail</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, and see the Homiletics on that verse). <span class="cmt_word">With the weeping of Jazer</span>. "With tears as genuine as Jazer's own" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">O Heshbon and Elealeh</span> (on the close connection of these two cities, see the comment on Isaiah 15:4). <span class="cmt_word">For the shouting</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">for on thy summer fruits and on thy harvest a shouting is fallen</span>. The "shouting" intended is that of the invading enemy, which replaces the ordinary joy-song of the vintagers (see ver. 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-14 Those who will not be counselled, cannot be helped. More souls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, the very proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, at length, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, and multitude of the wicked shall perish.</body></html>
