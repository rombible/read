Jerome (<span class= "ital">Comm. in Esai. </span>5) speaks of it as about half a Roman mile from Heshbon, and as one of the strongest fortresses of Moab.

See Note there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fields of Heshbon</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 15:4). The whole of the Mishor, or Belka, on the edge of which <span class="accented">Hesbdn</span> stands, is cultivable and capable of producing good crops. The Moabites stored water in reservoirs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>), and made their country a garden. <span class="cmt_word">The vine of Sib-mah</span>. "Sibmah" is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-8.htm">Numbers 32:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a> among the towns of the Reubenites. According to Jerome ('Comment. in Esaiam'), it was less than half a mile distant from Heshbon. Jeremiah follows Isaiah in lamenting the destruction of its vines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof</span>. "The lords of the heathen" are probably the Assyrians, who made a practice of destroying the fruit trees in an enemy's country, for the mere purpose of doing mischief ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 84). It is wanton to discard this very satisfactory sense for the strange one that "the choice plants have broken <span class="accented">down -</span> i.e., made drunk - the lords of the heathen" (Cheyne). The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by Gesenius, Ewald, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Meier, and Dr. Kay. <span class="cmt_word">They are come even unto Jazer;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (<span class="accented">the vines</span>)<span class="accented">reached to Jazer</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vine of Sibmah was cultivated as far as Jazer. Jazer lay about twelve miles north of Heshben, in the territory of Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-35.htm">Numbers 32:35</a>). It is probably identified with <span class="accented">Es Szir</span>, which is in the required position, and retains a trace of the name (Seetzen,' Reisen,' vol. 1. pp. 397, 398). <span class="cmt_word">They wandered through the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they strayed into the wilderness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cultivation was pushed eastward into the actual <span class="accented">midbar</span>, or desert. <span class="cmt_word">Her branches are stretched out</span>; or, <span class="accented">her offshoots are spread abroad</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the young shoots or slips are taken by the cultivators and spread further and further. They are even carried across the Dead Sea, and planted on its western shore. Mr. Cheyne supposes the prophet to refer to the "vineyards of En-gedi" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-14 Those who will not be counselled, cannot be helped. More souls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, the very proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, at length, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, and multitude of the wicked shall perish.</body></html>
