It is variously translated by "hitherto" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-34.htm" title="But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant till now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.">2Samuel 15:34</a>), "from the beginning" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-3.htm" title="I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.">Isaiah 48:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-5.htm" title="I have even from the beginning declared it to you; before it came to pass I showed it you: lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.">Isaiah 48:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-7.htm" title="They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you heard them not; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.">Isaiah 48:7</a>). It seems to imply that thus far Isaiah had been in part reproducing the "burden" of an older prophet, or of one given to him to deliver at an earlier date.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the word</span>, etc. The third and concluding section begins here. This prophecy, Isaiah says, is one, not now delivered for the first time, but existent previously. How long previously, he leaves quite vague. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-14 Those who will not be counselled, cannot be helped. More souls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, the very proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gain the gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compass proud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; but they shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turn laughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us always rejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice with holy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations of such a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moab are unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can and will make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near, and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover the way of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but by submission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, at length, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, and multitude of the wicked shall perish.</body></html>
