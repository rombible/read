From thanksgiving and confession, the people betake themselves to prayer, and beseech God to look down from heaven once more, to have compassion on them, to acknowledge them, and to save them alike from themselves (ver. 17) and from their adversaries (vers. 18, 19). "It is difficult to overrate the spiritual beauty of the prayer contained in this passage. We may admit that the most prominent motive urged by the speaker has a nationalistic air; but behind this, and strengthening it, is a sense of the infiniteness of the Divine mercy, and of the <span class="accented">strong</span> vitality of the union between Jehovah and his people" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look down from heaven</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8.htm">2 Kings 8</a>:30). "The Lord's seat" was "in heaven." While the temple lay in ruins, the Jews would naturally address their prayers to God in his heavenly abode. <span class="cmt_word">From the habitation of thy holiness</span>. Mr. Cheyne translates, from the <span class="accented">height</span> of thy holiness," taking the meaning of the rare word <span class="accented">z'bul</span> from the Assyrian. "Height" certainly suits well most of the other places where the word <span class="accented">z'bul</span> occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-2.htm">2 Chronicles 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Where is thy zeal?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What has become of it?

And thy strength; rather, <span class="accented">and thy great acts</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-2.htm">Psalm 150:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sounding of thy bowels</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their thrilling or vibration - an indication of sympathy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>).

There was no room for questioning the fact. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:15-19 They beseech him to look down on the abject condition of their once-favoured nation. Would it not be glorious to his name to remove the veil from their hearts, to return to the tribes of his inheritance? The Babylonish captivity, and the after-deliverance of the Jews, were shadows of the events here foretold. The Lord looks down upon us in tenderness and mercy. Spiritual judgments are more to be dreaded than any other calamities; and we should most carefully avoid those sins which justly provoke the Lord to leave men to themselves and to their deceiver. Our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name; thy people have always looked upon thee as the God to whom they might appeal. The Lord will hear the prayers of those who belong to him, and deliver them from those not called by his name.</body></html>
