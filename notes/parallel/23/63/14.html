Israel's passage through the Sinaitic peninsula into Canaan is compared to the movement of a herd of cattle from its summer pastures in the mountains to the valley at their base, where for a time it rests. So God gave his people, after their many trials, "rest" in Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-11.htm">Hebrews 3:11-18</a><span class="cmt_word">). So didst thou lead thy people</span>. "So" refers, not to the last simile only, but to the entire description contained in vers. 11-14. <span class="cmt_word">To make thyself a glorious name</span> (comp. ver. 12, and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:7-14 The latter part of this chapter, and the whole of the next, seem to express the prayers of the Jews on their conversation. They acknowledge God's great mercies and favours to their nation. They confess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat his forgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they have so long suffered. The only-begotten Son of the Father became the Angel or Messenger of his love; thus he redeemed and bare them with tenderness. Yet they murmured, and resisted his Holy Spirit, despising and persecuting his prophets, rejecting and crucifying the promised Messiah. All our comforts and hopes spring from the loving-kindness of the Lord, and all our miseries and fears from our sins. But he is the Saviour, and when sinners seek after him, who in other ages glorified himself by saving and feeding his purchased flock, and leading them safely through dangers, and has given his Holy Spirit to prosper the labours of his ministers, there is good ground to hope they are discovering the way of peace.</body></html>
