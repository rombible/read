The Hebrew text gives, <span class= "ital">In all their affliction there was no affliction: i.e., </span>it was as nothing compared with the salvation which came from Jehovah. The Authorised Version follows the <span class= "ital">K?ri, </span>or marginal reading of the Hebrew. It may be inferred, from the strange rendering of both clauses in the LXX.

It became an intense oppression, when the king "arose who knew not Joseph" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>). God's sympathy with Israel's sufferings at this time is strongly marked in the narrative of Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7, 17</a>). An alternative reading of the Hebrew text gives the sense, "In all their affliction he was not an adversary;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he did not afflict them for their hurt, but for their benefit. But the reading followed by our translators, and most moderns, is to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">The angel of his presence saved them</span>. "The angel of his presence" occurs nowhere but in this place. It is probably equivalent to "the angel of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>), or "the angel of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a>, etc.), and designates either the Second Person of the Trinity, or the highest of the angelic company, who seems to be the archangel Michael (see Pussy's 'Daniel,' pp. 525, 526). (For the angelic interpositions which "saved" Israel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">In his love and in his pity he</span> <span class="cmt_word">redeemed them</span>. The "redemption" of this passage is probably that from the bondage of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>, etc.), which belonged to "the days of old" - not the spiritual redemption from the bondage of sin, which was reserved for the time of the Messiah. Having "redeemed" them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and thereby, as it were, purchased them to be his own, he bare them - "Carried them on eagles' wings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>), and brought them safely through the wilderness to Palestine (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10-12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:7-14 The latter part of this chapter, and the whole of the next, seem to express the prayers of the Jews on their conversation. They acknowledge God's great mercies and favours to their nation. They confess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat his forgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they have so long suffered. The only-begotten Son of the Father became the Angel or Messenger of his love; thus he redeemed and bare them with tenderness. Yet they murmured, and resisted his Holy Spirit, despising and persecuting his prophets, rejecting and crucifying the promised Messiah. All our comforts and hopes spring from the loving-kindness of the Lord, and all our miseries and fears from our sins. But he is the Saviour, and when sinners seek after him, who in other ages glorified himself by saving and feeding his purchased flock, and leading them safely through dangers, and has given his Holy Spirit to prosper the labours of his ministers, there is good ground to hope they are discovering the way of peace.</body></html>
