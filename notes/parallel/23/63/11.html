It is questioned <span class="accented">who</span> remembered, God or his people. Gesenius, Hitzig, Ewald, Nagelbach, Delitzsch, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne are in favour of the people; Bishop Lowth and Dr. Kay of God. The reflections which follow (vers. 11-13) seem certainly most appropriate to the people, or to the prophet speaking in their name. <span class="cmt_word">Where is he that brought them up out of the sea?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the Red Sea" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>). What has become of the protecting God who then delivered them? <span class="cmt_word">With the shepherd of his flock</span>; or, <span class="accented">shepherds</span>, according to another reading. The "shepherd" might be either Moses, or "the angel of his face" (ver. 9). The "shepherds" - if that reading be preferred - must be Moses, Aaron, and perhaps Miriam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>). Where he that put his Holy Spirit within him? The "him" of this passage undoubtedly refers to "the people" (Rosenmuller, Knobel, Delitzsch, Kay, Cheyne). God gave to the people in the wilderness "his good Spirit to instruct them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>), and guide them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-4.htm">Haggai 2:4, 5</a>), and govern them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:7-14 The latter part of this chapter, and the whole of the next, seem to express the prayers of the Jews on their conversation. They acknowledge God's great mercies and favours to their nation. They confess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat his forgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they have so long suffered. The only-begotten Son of the Father became the Angel or Messenger of his love; thus he redeemed and bare them with tenderness. Yet they murmured, and resisted his Holy Spirit, despising and persecuting his prophets, rejecting and crucifying the promised Messiah. All our comforts and hopes spring from the loving-kindness of the Lord, and all our miseries and fears from our sins. But he is the Saviour, and when sinners seek after him, who in other ages glorified himself by saving and feeding his purchased flock, and leading them safely through dangers, and has given his Holy Spirit to prosper the labours of his ministers, there is good ground to hope they are discovering the way of peace.</body></html>
