I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1-6</a> and what precedes and follows. They must be dealt with, accordingly, as a separate section, though not, as some critics have suggested, by a different writer. To understand its relation to the prophet's mind, we must remember the part which Edom had taken during the history of which Isaiah was cognisant, perhaps also that which he foresaw they would take in the period that was to follow. That part had been one of persistent hostility. They had been allied with the Tyrians against Judah, and had been guilty of ruthless atrocities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/1-9.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:">Amos 1:9-11</a>). They had carried off Jewish prisoners as slaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.">Obadiah 1:10-11</a>). They had been allies of <span class= "ital">the </span>Assyrian invaders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm" title="The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;">Psalm 83:6</a>), and had smitten Judah in the days of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.">2Chronicles 28:17</a>). If we think of the prophet as seeing in spirit the working of the old enmity at a later period, we may extend the induction to their exultation at the capture of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm" title="Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.">Lamentations 4:21</a>). The memory of these things sank deep into the nation, and the first words of the last of the prophets echo the old hatred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/1-2.htm" title="I have loved you, said the LORD. Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? said the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,">Malachi 1:2-4</a>). In the later days of Judaism, where Rabbis uttered their curses against their oppressors, Edom was substituted for Rome, as St. John substitutes Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>). Isaiah, possibly starting from the memory of some recent outrages in the reign of Hezekiah, and taking Edom as the representative of all the nearer hereditary enemies of Israel, into an ecstacy of jubilation, and sees the conquering king returning from his work of vengeance. The form is that of a warrior coming from the Idumsean Bozrah (as distinct from that in the Hauran, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm" title="And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.">Jeremiah 48:24</a>) in <span class= "ital">bright-red </span>garments. And the colour (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-13.htm" title="And he was clothed with a clothing dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.">Revelation 19:13</a>) is not that of the scarlet dress worn by soldiers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm" title="The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.">Nahum 2:3</a>), but that of blood just shed.<p><span class= "bld">Travelling.</span>--The Hebrew verb (<span class= "ital">bending, or tossing </span>the head) indicates the movement and gestures of a conqueror exulting in his victory.<p><span class= "bld">I that speak . . .</span>--The hero-avenger, the righteous king who represents Jehovah, hears the wondering question, and makes answer for himself. "Righteousness" and "salvation," which he claims as his attributes, show that he is none other than the ideal Servant of the Lord of Hosts, sharing His attributes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - A JUDGMENT ON IDUMAEA. Isaiah had already, in the first portion of his prophecy, announced" a great slaughter in the land of Idumaea" as resolved on in the counsels of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-10</a>). He now recurs to the subject, and represents Jehovah as a warrior with blood-stained garments, fresh from the field of battle in Edom, where he has trodden down his foes and taken a fierce vengeance on them. The Idumaeans probably represent the world-power; and the "day of vengeance" may be one still future, in which the enemies of God will feel the weight of his hand. The description stands by itself, neither connected with what goes before nor with what follows. It has the appearance of a separate poem, which accident has placed in its present position. In form it is "a lyrico-dramatic dialogue between the prophet as a bystander and a victorious warrior (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah) returning from battle in Idumaea" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this?</span> The prophet opens the dialogue with an inquiry, "Who is it that presents himself before him suddenly in a strange guise?" He comes from <span class="cmt_word">Edom,</span> from <span class="cmt_word">Bozrah</span> - a principal Edomite city (see the comment on Isaiah 34:6) - <span class="cmt_word">with dyed garments</span>; or, rather, <span class="accented">with blood-red garments-garments</span> incarnadined with gore. "Who is this," again he asks, "that is glorious (or, <span class="accented">splendid</span>) in his apparel" - the blood-stained vesture of the conqueror was a glory to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>)- "as he travels" (or, "bends forward" ) <span class="cmt_word">in the greatness of his strength</span> - exhibiting in his movements a mighty indomitable strength? Who is it? The reply is immediate - <span class="cmt_word">I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I, whose every word is "holy, just, and true," who alone am able to "save to the uttermost all that come to me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The answer unmistakably indicates that the figure which has appeared to the prophet is that of Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:1-6 The prophet, in vision, beholds the Messiah returning in triumph from the conquest of his enemies, of whom Edom was a type. Travelling, not as wearied by the combat, but, in the greatness of his strength, prepared to overcome every opposing power. Messiah declares that he had been treading the wine-press of the wrath of God, Re 14:19; 19:13, and by his own power, without any human help, he had crushed his obstinate opposers, for the day of vengeance was determined on, being the appointed season for rescuing his church. Once, he appeared on earth in apparent weakness, to pour out his precious blood as an atonement for our sins; but he will in due time appear in the greatness of his strength. The vintage ripens apace; the day of vengeance, fixed and determined on, approaches apace; let sinners seek to be reconciled to their righteous Judge, ere he brings down their strength to the earth. Does Christ say, I come quickly? let our hearts reply, Even so, come; let the year of the redeemed come.</body></html>
