They have erred and strayed from God's ways, they ' allow; but why has he permitted it?

The reproach borders on irreverence, but is kept within the limits of piety by the affection and trust that underlie it. They are like wayward children reproaching a tender mother, not quite believing in the justice of their reproaches, but with a very confident faith in her love and in her power to aid. They entertain no doubt but that God will "return" to them, and acknowledge them as his sheep, and resume their guidance and direction. <span class="cmt_word">And hardened our heart</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>), "When men have scornfully and obstinately rejected the grace of God, God withdraws it from them judicially, gives them up to their wanderings, and makes their hearts incapable of faith" (Delitzsch). If the process has not gone very far, God may relent, and "return," and soften the proud heart, and renew in it "his fear." This is what Israel now entreats him to do. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">thy servants'sake.</span> There was always "a remnant" in the worst times, which had not" bowed the knee to Baal." This was God's true "inheritance," which he might be expected to protect and aid. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:15-19 They beseech him to look down on the abject condition of their once-favoured nation. Would it not be glorious to his name to remove the veil from their hearts, to return to the tribes of his inheritance? The Babylonish captivity, and the after-deliverance of the Jews, were shadows of the events here foretold. The Lord looks down upon us in tenderness and mercy. Spiritual judgments are more to be dreaded than any other calamities; and we should most carefully avoid those sins which justly provoke the Lord to leave men to themselves and to their deceiver. Our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name; thy people have always looked upon thee as the God to whom they might appeal. The Lord will hear the prayers of those who belong to him, and deliver them from those not called by his name.</body></html>
