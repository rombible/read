Abraham might disclaim his degenerate descendants, but Jehovah would still recognise them. Implicitly, at least, the words contain the truth that "God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>). He is still their Redeemer. The words may possibly imply the thought that, as in the case of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-13.htm" title="This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.">2 Maccabees 15:13-14</a>), and Rachel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), Abraham was thought of as watching over his posterity, and interceding for them. So, eventually, Abraham appears in the popular belief of Israel, as welcoming his children in the unseen world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;">Luke 16:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doubtless thou art our Father</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for thou art our Father.</span> This is the ground of their appeal to God. As their Father, he must love them, and must be ready to listen to them. Abraham and Isaac, their earthly fathers, were of no service, lent them no aid, seemed to have ceased to feel any interest in them. It cannot be justly argued from this that the Jews looked to Abraham and Isaac as actual "patron saints," or directed towards them their religious regards. Had this been so, there would have been abundant evidence of it. <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O Lord, art our Father</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>). Though the relationship was revealed under the old covenant, it was practically realized only upon the rarest occasions<span class="cmt_word">. Our Redeemer; thy name</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">our Redeemer has been thy name from of old.</span> "Redeemer" first appears as a name of God in Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>) and in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-35.htm">Psalm 78:35</a>). It is an <span class="accented">epitheton usitatum</span> only in the later portion of Isaiah. There it occurs thirteen times. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:15-19 They beseech him to look down on the abject condition of their once-favoured nation. Would it not be glorious to his name to remove the veil from their hearts, to return to the tribes of his inheritance? The Babylonish captivity, and the after-deliverance of the Jews, were shadows of the events here foretold. The Lord looks down upon us in tenderness and mercy. Spiritual judgments are more to be dreaded than any other calamities; and we should most carefully avoid those sins which justly provoke the Lord to leave men to themselves and to their deceiver. Our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name; thy people have always looked upon thee as the God to whom they might appeal. The Lord will hear the prayers of those who belong to him, and deliver them from those not called by his name.</body></html>
