Compared with that promise, the period of possession, from Joshua and David to the fall of the monarchy, was but as a "little while." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a>.) The seeming failure of the promise was aggravated by the fact that the enemies of Israel had trodden down the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people of thy holiness</span>; or, <span class="accented">thy holy people</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-9.htm">Isaiah 62:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>: 64:11).

The general meaning is the same in either case. "Israel, God's people, has held Palestine but for a little while" - a few centuries - and now the heathen have been allowed to make themselves masters of it, (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-8.htm">Ezra 10:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:15-19 They beseech him to look down on the abject condition of their once-favoured nation. Would it not be glorious to his name to remove the veil from their hearts, to return to the tribes of his inheritance? The Babylonish captivity, and the after-deliverance of the Jews, were shadows of the events here foretold. The Lord looks down upon us in tenderness and mercy. Spiritual judgments are more to be dreaded than any other calamities; and we should most carefully avoid those sins which justly provoke the Lord to leave men to themselves and to their deceiver. Our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name; thy people have always looked upon thee as the God to whom they might appeal. The Lord will hear the prayers of those who belong to him, and deliver them from those not called by his name.</body></html>
