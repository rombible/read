<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18-20</a>), the received symbol of the carnage of battle. What the hero-conqueror asserts is that the battle was fought by him single-handed. He had no human allies, but God was with him. A slight change in the vowel-points, adopted by some interpreters, turns the verbs into futures: "I <span class= "ital">will </span>tread <span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "ital">will </span>trample, <span class= "bld">. . .</span>" as in the second clause of the Authorised Version. It is better, perhaps to take the latter verb also as in the past. The work of slaughter is clearly thought of as accomplished before the warrior is seen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have trodden the wine-press.</span> The warrior replies. He accepts the suggestion of the prophet; but metaphorically, not literally. He has indeed been "treading a wine-press," but it is the wine-press of his fury, in which he has trampled down his enemies; and the stains upon his raiment are, consequently, not wine-stains, but stains of blood (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Alone</span>. In mine own might, with none to aid me. The literal wine-press was always trodden by a band of men. Of the people; rather, of <span class="accented">the peoples</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the neighbouring nations none took part with God against the special enemies of his people, the Idumaeans. All more or less sympathized with his adversaries, and therefore participated in their punishment (see ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">For I will tread them... trample them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so I trode them</span> ... <span class="accented">trampled them</span> (Lowth, Rosenmuller, Delitzsch, Cheyne, by an alteration of the vowel-points). The whole is a prophecy of the future; but the dramatic form of the narrative requires that the verbs should be in the past. As "the peoples" would not help God, but took the side of his enemies, they too were placed in the winepress, and crushed under his feet. <span class="cmt_word">Their</span> <span class="cmt_word">blood;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their juice.</span> Lowth and Kay translate, "life-blood;" Delitzsch, "life-sap;" Mr. Cheyne, excellently, "life-stream."

Travelling, not as wearied by the combat, but, in the greatness of his strength, prepared to overcome every opposing power. Messiah declares that he had been treading the wine-press of the wrath of God, Re 14:19; 19:13, and by his own power, without any human help, he had crushed his obstinate opposers, for the day of vengeance was determined on, being the appointed season for rescuing his church. Once, he appeared on earth in apparent weakness, to pour out his precious blood as an atonement for our sins; but he will in due time appear in the greatness of his strength. The vintage ripens apace; the day of vengeance, fixed and determined on, approaches apace; let sinners seek to be reconciled to their righteous Judge, ere he brings down their strength to the earth. Does Christ say, I come quickly? let our hearts reply, Even so, come; let the year of the redeemed come.</body></html>
