The rebellions of Israel against God commenced in the wilderness. They rebelled at Sinai, when they set up the golden calf; at Meribah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>); at Shittim, when they consorted with the daughters of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6</a>). Under the Judges, their conduct was one long rebellion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>). They rebelled in Samuel's time by asking for a king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 19, 20</a>). The ten tribes rebelled under Jeroboam, and set up the idolatry of the calves at Dan and Bethel. Worse idolatries followed, and in two centuries and a half had reached such a height, that God was provoked to "remove Israel out of his sight" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>). Judah remained, but "rebelled" under Manasseh, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, "transgressing very much after all the abominations of the heathen, and polluting the very house of the Lord at Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). These rebellions against God <span class="cmt_word">vexed his Holy Spirit</span> - "provoked him," "grieved him," "moved the Holy One in Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40, 41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he was turned to be their enemy</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4, 5</a>). Judah had "filled up the measure of her iniquities," had gone on "until there was no remedy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>). God's indignation was therefore poured out upon her without let or stint. "He cut oft' in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he drew back his right hand from before the enemy; he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. He bent his <span class="accented">bow like an enemy</span>; he stood with his right hand <span class="accented">as an adversary</span>, and slew all that were pleasant in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion; he poured out his fury like fire. The Lord was as an enemy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3-5</a>). He fought against them; rather, <span class="accented">he himself fought against them.</span> God himself, though they were "his people," yet fought against them and for the Chaldeans in that final struggle. He "gave the city into the hand of the King of Babylon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/63.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>63:7-14 The latter part of this chapter, and the whole of the next, seem to express the prayers of the Jews on their conversation. They acknowledge God's great mercies and favours to their nation. They confess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat his forgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they have so long suffered. The only-begotten Son of the Father became the Angel or Messenger of his love; thus he redeemed and bare them with tenderness. Yet they murmured, and resisted his Holy Spirit, despising and persecuting his prophets, rejecting and crucifying the promised Messiah. All our comforts and hopes spring from the loving-kindness of the Lord, and all our miseries and fears from our sins. But he is the Saviour, and when sinners seek after him, who in other ages glorified himself by saving and feeding his purchased flock, and leading them safely through dangers, and has given his Holy Spirit to prosper the labours of his ministers, there is good ground to hope they are discovering the way of peace.</body></html>
