The prophet, on this view, sees in his vision, as it were, a restored Eden, a paradise life, in which the fiercest brutes have lost their fierceness. The words admit, however, of being taken as a generalised statement: "None shall hurt nor destroy <span class= "bld">. . .</span>" The "holy mountain "is none other than the "mountain of the Lord's house" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a> in its future apocalyptic glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>), but may, perhaps, include the whole of the hill-country of Israel, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm" title="When you cry, let your companies deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that puts his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;">Isaiah 57:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-54.htm" title="And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.">Psalm 78:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm" title="You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.">Exodus 15:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord.</span>--If, as some have thought, the "earth" here should be the <span class= "ital">land </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-19.htm" title="Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.">Isaiah 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm" title="For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the middle of all the land.">Isaiah 10:23</a>, the land of Judah), that region is represented as the paradise centre of a restored world, to which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>, all nations turn for light and blessing. Probably, however, the words may be taken in their wider significance. This was for the prophet the crown and consummation of the work of redemption. More than all removal of physical evil, he thought of a victory over moral and spiritual darkness. As it is, in the existing order of the world, few fear God; still fewer know Him as He should be known. But in that new earth "the knowledge of Jehovah" shall flow far and wide. Even as the waters of the Mediterranean (the sea which must have suggested the prophet's comparison) washed the shores of the far-off isles of the Gentiles, the coasts of Chittim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-24.htm" title="And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.">Numbers 24:24</a>), as well as those of Israel, so should the knowledge of the truth of God expand beyond the limits of the people of Israel. Hence the transition was natural to the prophecies which speak at once of the restoration of Israel and the in-gathering of the heathen. It should be remembered that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-17.htm" title="So shall you know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.">Joel 3:17</a>, prophecies like in kind had preceded Isaiah's utterance. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm" title="For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Habakkuk 2:14</a> it is all but verbally reproduced.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My holy mountain</span>. As the Jewish Church is always bound up with the "holy hill of Zion," so the Messianic one receives the designation of "the mountain of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>), or "the holy mountain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>). What was physically true of the type is transferred to the antitype, which is "a city set upon a hill" in a certain sense. <span class="cmt_word">The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord</span> (romp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28</a>:29). A fruitful knowledge, guiding and influencing conduct, seems to be intended (see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>, "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children"). <span class="cmt_word">As the waters cover the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "as the ocean covers and fills the bed prepared for it." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 The Messiah is called a Rod, and a Branch. The words signify a small, tender product; a shoot, such as is easily broken off. He comes forth out of the stem of Jesse; when the royal family was cut down and almost levelled with the ground, it would sprout again. The house of David was brought very low at the time of Christ's birth. The Messiah thus gave early notice that his kingdom was not of this world. But the Holy Spirit, in all his gifts and graces, shall rest and abide upon him; he shall have the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, Col 1:19; 2:9. Many consider that seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are here mentioned. And the doctrine of the influences of the Holy Spirit is here clearly taught. The Messiah would be just and righteous in all his government. His threatening shall be executed by the working of his Spirit according to his word. There shall be great peace and quiet under his government. The gospel changes the nature, and makes those who trampled on the meek of the earth, meek like them, and kind to them. But it shall be more fully shown in the latter days. Also Christ, the great Shepherd, shall take care of his flock, that the nature of troubles, and of death itself, shall be so changed, that they shall not do any real hurt. God's people shall be delivered, not only from evil, but from the fear of it. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The better we know the God of love, the more shall we be changed into the same likeness, and the better disposed to all who have any likeness to him. This knowledge shall extend as the sea, so far shall it spread. And this blessed power there have been witnesses in every age of Christianity, though its most glorious time, here foretold, is not yet arrived. Meanwhile let us aim that our example and endeavours may help to promote the honour of Christ and his kingdom of peace.</body></html>
