<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-14.htm" title="And on all the high mountains, and on all the hills that are lifted up,">Isaiah 2:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-1.htm" title="Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). The poor whom they trampled on should be the special objects of the care of the true King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm" title="The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.">Matthew 11:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He shall smite the earth . . .</span>--The "earth" stands here, if we accept the reading, for the rulers who are for the time supreme in it. A slight alteration of the Hebrew gives <span class= "ital">shall smite the tyrant, </span>which forms a better parallelism with the "ungodly" of the next clause. The phrase "the <span class= "ital">sceptre </span>of his mouth" is significant. The word which the Messiah-King speaks shall be as the sceptre which is the symbol of authority. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>, "a sharp two-edged sword" comes forth from the mouth of the Christ of St. John's vision. The latter clause, "with the breath of his lips shall he slay <span class= "bld">. . .</span> ,"has a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-5.htm" title="Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.">Hosea 6:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With righteousness shall he judge the poor</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>, "A king shall reign in righteousness"). It would be characteristic of the Messiah's rule that the poor should be eared for, that oppression should cease, and judgment be no more perverted in favor of the rich. There is an intended contrast between the Messiah's rule in this respect, and that of the princes of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1, 2</a>). Christian countries still, for the most part, follow their Lord's example in this particular, if in no other, having judges that are incorruptible, and tribunals that are free from any leaning against the poor. <span class="cmt_word">Reprove</span>; or, <span class="accented">plead</span> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The meek of the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the humble</span>, or <span class="accented">afflicted</span>. Low condition, not meekness of spirit, is what the word used expresses. <span class="cmt_word">He shall smite the earth.</span> A slight alteration of the text produces the meaning, <span class="accented">be shall smite the terrible one</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>), which improves the parallelism of the clauses. But there is no need of any alteration, parallelism in Isaiah being often incomplete. The Messiah at his coming will "smite <span class="accented">the earth"</span> generally (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>, "I came not to send peace on the earth, but a sword"), and will also especially chastise "the wicked." <span class="cmt_word">The rod of his mouth... the breath of his lips</span>. "The Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). The sayings of Christ pierce the conscience and penetrate the soul as no other words that ever came from a human mouth. In the last day words from his mouth will consign to everlasting life or to everlasting destruction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 The Messiah is called a Rod, and a Branch. The words signify a small, tender product; a shoot, such as is easily broken off. He comes forth out of the stem of Jesse; when the royal family was cut down and almost levelled with the ground, it would sprout again. The house of David was brought very low at the time of Christ's birth. The Messiah thus gave early notice that his kingdom was not of this world. But the Holy Spirit, in all his gifts and graces, shall rest and abide upon him; he shall have the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, Col 1:19; 2:9. Many consider that seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are here mentioned. And the doctrine of the influences of the Holy Spirit is here clearly taught. The Messiah would be just and righteous in all his government. His threatening shall be executed by the working of his Spirit according to his word. There shall be great peace and quiet under his government. The gospel changes the nature, and makes those who trampled on the meek of the earth, meek like them, and kind to them. But it shall be more fully shown in the latter days. Also Christ, the great Shepherd, shall take care of his flock, that the nature of troubles, and of death itself, shall be so changed, that they shall not do any real hurt. God's people shall be delivered, not only from evil, but from the fear of it. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The better we know the God of love, the more shall we be changed into the same likeness, and the better disposed to all who have any likeness to him. This knowledge shall extend as the sea, so far shall it spread. And this blessed power there have been witnesses in every age of Christianity, though its most glorious time, here foretold, is not yet arrived. Meanwhile let us aim that our example and endeavours may help to promote the honour of Christ and his kingdom of peace.</body></html>
