and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, is the same as the "rod" and "branch" growing from the root in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>. The new shoot of the fallen tree of Jesse is to grow up like a stately palm, seen afar off upon the heights of the "holy mountain," a signal round which the distant nations might rally as their centre. So the name of "the root of David" is applied to the glorified Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm" title="And one of the elders said to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.">Revelation 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.">Revelation 22:16</a>. The word for "seek" implies, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm" title="And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the middle thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.">Isaiah 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-6.htm" title="Seek you the LORD while he may be found, call you on him while he is near:">Isaiah 55:6</a>, the special seeking for wisdom and illumination.<p><span class= "bld">His rest shall be glorious.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">his resting-place shall be glory; i.e., </span>he shall abide evermore in the eternal glory which is the dwelling-place of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-13.</span> - THE JEWS AND GENTILES SHALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER INTO MESSIAH'S KINGDOM. It is characteristic of "the evangelical prophet" that he dwells earnestly and frequently on the calling of the Gentiles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-22.htm">Isaiah 19:22-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>, etc.). The prophecies to Abraham had repeatedly declared that "in him," or "in his seed," "all the families of the earth should be blessed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>); and some of the psalmists had echoed the glad sound and spoken of God as worshipped generally by "the nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-11.htm">Psalm 148:11</a>). But the idea had taken little hold upon the chosen people generally; and was practically new to them when Isaiah was inspired to preach it afresh. To render it the more palatable, he unites with it the promise of a great gathering of the dispersed Israelites from all quarters to the banner of Messiah, when it is set up. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall he a root of Jesse</span>. The "root" of this place is the same as the "rod" and "branch" of ver. 1. The "rod" springs up out of a "root," and is inseparably connected with it. <span class="cmt_word">Which shall stand for an ensign of the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the peoples</span>. The "rod" shall lift itself up, and become an ensign, seen from afar, and attracting to itself the attention of "the peoples" or "nations" generally. The Acts and Epistles show how speedily this prophecy was fulfilled. Greeks, Romans, Galatians, Cappadoeians, Babylonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>), saw the ensign, and sought to it. <span class="cmt_word">His rest shall be glorious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his resting-place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his Church, with which he abides forever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The Shechinah of his presence makes the Church "glorious" (literally, "a glory") throughout all ages; but the glory will not fully appear till the time of the "new heavens and new earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; Roy. 21, 22.), when he will dwell visibly with it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-16 When the gospel should be publicly preached, the Gentiles would seek Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and find rest of soul. When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.</body></html>
