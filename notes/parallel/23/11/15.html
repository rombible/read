<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-5.htm" title="And the east border was the salt sea, even to the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:">Joshua 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-19.htm" title="And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.">Joshua 18:19</a>, the "bay" or "gulf." The "Egyptian sea" is the Gulf of Suez, and the prophet pictures to himself another marvel like the passage of the Red Sea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-22.htm" title="And the children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.">Exodus 14:22</a>. The "river," on the other hand, is the word Commonly used for the Euphrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-21.htm" title="So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.">Genesis 31:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm" title="And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.">Joshua 24:2</a>), and that meaning is assigned to it here by most commentators, who refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-27.htm" title="That said to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers:">Isaiah 44:27</a> as a parallel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm" title="And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.">Isaiah 19:5</a>, however, it is found, as here, in parallelism with the "sea" of Egypt, and as it there refers to the Nile, that meaning may well be accepted here. The prophet describes, in language which almost excludes the thought of a merely literal fulfilment, a renewal of wonders transcending those of the Exodus, and it was natural that his description should bear the local colouring of the region. He contemplates a return from Egypt as much as from Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>). On this view the words that follow, "will smite it in the seven streams," refer naturally enough to the seven mouths that enclose and intersect the Delta of the Nile. On the other view, the words may be interpreted as meaning literally, "I will smite it [Euphrates] into seven streams," and figuratively, "I will reduce the power of Assyria [or Babylon, as an Assyrian city] to insignificance."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall utterly destroy</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall lay under a curse</span> (Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The tongue of the Egyptian sea</span>.

When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.</body></html>
