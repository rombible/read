He looked back on the history of the past, and saw almost from the first the deep line of cleavage between north and south, Israel and Judah. Century by century the chasm had grown deeper and wider; sub-sections of antagonism had increased its bitterness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-21.htm" title="Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:21</a>); but in the times of the Christ the sense of unity should be stronger than the old hostilities. The prophet's hope connects itself with Hezekiah's efforts after a restored unity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/30-1.htm" title="And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 30:1-12</a>). The "envy" of Ephraim "is, as the parallelism shows, that of which Ephraim was the object.

If any such remain among the Ephraimites, Divine vengeance shall "cut them off," that there be no open disturbance of the harmony. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-16 When the gospel should be publicly preached, the Gentiles would seek Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and find rest of soul. When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.</body></html>
