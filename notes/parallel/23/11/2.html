It was the "spirit of the Lord" that had made men true heroes and judges in the days of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm" title="Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.">Judges 13:25</a>). It was in the "spirit of the Lord" descending on Jesus of Nazareth and abiding on Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>) that men were taught to see the token that He was the Christ of God. And in this case the spirit was to give more than the heroic daring which had characterised Jephthah and Samson. The future King was to be as a David and Solomon in one, pre-eminent, chiefly, as the Prince of Peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm" title="Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.">Isaiah 9:7</a>), in the wisdom and counsel which had been the glory of the latter. "Wisdom," in its highest form, as implying the comprehension of the secret things of God; "understanding," as the sagacity which discerned the right thing to do and the right word to say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>) in all human relationships; these formed the first link in the chain of supernatural gifts. With these there was to be the "spirit of counsel and might," the clear purpose and strength which fits a king for the right exercise of sovereignty; and lastly, as at once the crown and source of all, the "spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord," the reverence and faith which is "the beginning of all wisdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The copious use of the vocabulary of the Book of Proverbs is interesting as showing the part which that book played in the prophet's education. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him</span> (comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1, 14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, etc.). The human nature of our Lord required, and received abundantly, the sanctifying and enlightening influences of the Holy Spirit. These influences were not in him transient or occasional, as in too many men, who more or less "<span class="accented">resist</span> the Spirit," but permanent and enduring. They "<span class="accented">rested upon"</span> him; from first to last never quitted, and never will quit, him. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of wisdom and understanding.</span> The influences of the Holy Spirit are manifold, affecting the entire complex nature of man (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8-11</a>). Here, three pairs of graces are set forth as specially manifested in the Messiah through the power of the Spirit: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Wisdom and understanding," or intellectual and moral apprehension (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) the ability to perceive moral and abstract truth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "counsel and might," or the power at once to scheme and originate, and also to carry out thought into act; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "The knowledge and the fear of the Lord," or acquaintance with the true will of God, combined with the determination to carry out that will to the full (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>). It is needless to say that all these qualities existed in the greatest perfection in our blessed Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 The Messiah is called a Rod, and a Branch. The words signify a small, tender product; a shoot, such as is easily broken off. He comes forth out of the stem of Jesse; when the royal family was cut down and almost levelled with the ground, it would sprout again. The house of David was brought very low at the time of Christ's birth. The Messiah thus gave early notice that his kingdom was not of this world. But the Holy Spirit, in all his gifts and graces, shall rest and abide upon him; he shall have the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, Col 1:19; 2:9. Many consider that seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are here mentioned. And the doctrine of the influences of the Holy Spirit is here clearly taught. The Messiah would be just and righteous in all his government. His threatening shall be executed by the working of his Spirit according to his word. There shall be great peace and quiet under his government. The gospel changes the nature, and makes those who trampled on the meek of the earth, meek like them, and kind to them. But it shall be more fully shown in the latter days. Also Christ, the great Shepherd, shall take care of his flock, that the nature of troubles, and of death itself, shall be so changed, that they shall not do any real hurt. God's people shall be delivered, not only from evil, but from the fear of it. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The better we know the God of love, the more shall we be changed into the same likeness, and the better disposed to all who have any likeness to him. This knowledge shall extend as the sea, so far shall it spread. And this blessed power there have been witnesses in every age of Christianity, though its most glorious time, here foretold, is not yet arrived. Meanwhile let us aim that our example and endeavours may help to promote the honour of Christ and his kingdom of peace.</body></html>
