The word for "measure" is strictly definite: the <span class= "ital">seah, </span>or third part of an <span class= "ital">ephah </span>(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-10.htm" title="Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.">Isaiah 5:10</a>), and therefore used as proverbial for its smallness, to express the extreme moderation of God's chastisements.<p><span class= "bld">When it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate With it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">When thou didst put her away, thou didst plead with her. </span>The prophet falls back upon the thought of Hosea 1-3, that Israel was the adulterous wife to whom Jehovah had given, as it were, a bill of divorcement, but against whom He did not carry the pleadings to the furthest point that the rigour of the law allowed. Comp. for this meaning <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm" title="The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-16.htm" title="For the LORD, the God of Israel, said that he hates putting away: for one covers violence with his garment, said the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that you deal not treacherously.">Malachi 2:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He stayeth his rough wind . . .</span>--The words have become familiar, as expressing the loving-kindness which will not heap chastisement on chastisement, lest a man should be swallowed up of overmuch sorrow, which keeps the "rough wind" from completing the devastation already wrought by the scorching "east wind." That rendering, however, can scarcely be maintained. The word translated "stay" is found elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/25-4.htm" title="Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.">Proverbs 25:4-5</a>, and there has the sense of "separating," or "sifting." And this is its sense here also, the thought expressed asserting, though in another form than the traditional rendering, the compassion of Jehovah, in that He <span class= "ital">sifts with his rough wind in the day of east wind; </span>though punishment come on punishment, it is reformatory, and not simply penal, to <span class= "ital">sift, </span>and not to destroy. A rendering accepted by some critics gives, <span class= "ital">He sigheth with His rough wind, </span>as though with a sorrowing pity mingled with the chastisement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Our translators have entirely mistaken the meaning of this verse. The proper rendering is, <span class="accented">In measure</span>, <span class="accented">when thou puttest her away</span>, <span class="accented">thou wilt contend with her</span>; <span class="accented">he sighed with his keen breath in the day of the east wind</span>. "In measure" means "with forbearance and moderation" - the punishment being carefully adjusted to the degree of the offence. God was about to "put Judah away" - to banish her into a far country; but still he would refrain himself - he would "not suffer his whole displeasure to arise," or give her over wholly to destruction. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the east wind</span>, or of the national catastrophe, when his breath was fierce and hard against his people, he would "sigh" at the needful chastisement. As Dr. Kay well says, "Amid the rough and stern severity which he breathed into the tempest, there was an undertone of sadness and grief." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:6-13 In the days of the gospel, the latter days, the gospel church shall be more firmly fixed than the Jewish church, and shall spread further. May our souls be continually watered and kept, that we may abound in the fruits of the Spirit, in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. The Jews yet are kept a separate and a numerous people; they have not been rooted out as those who slew them. The condition of that nation, through so many ages, forms a certain proof of the Divine origin of the Scriptures; and the Jews live amongst us, a continued warning against sin. But though winds are ever so rough, ever so high, God can say to them, Peace, be still. And though God will afflict his people, yet he will make their afflictions to work for the good of their souls. According to this promise, since the captivity in Babylon, no people have shown such hatred to idols and idolatry as the Jews. And to all God's people, the design of affliction is to part between them and sin. The affliction has done us good, when we keep at a distance from the occasions of sin, and use care that we may not be tempted to it. Jerusalem had been defended by grace and the Divine protection; but when God withdrew, she was left like a wilderness. This has awfully come to pass. And this is a figure of the deplorable state of the vineyard, the church, when it brought forth wild grapes. Sinners flatter themselves they shall not be dealt with severely, because God is merciful, and is their Maker. We see how weak those pleas will be. Verses 12,13, seem to predict the restoration of the Jews after the Babylonish captivity, and their recovery from their present dispersion. This is further applicable to the preaching of the gospel, by which sinners are gathered into the grace of God; the gospel proclaims the acceptable year of the Lord. Those gathered by the sounding of the gospel trumpet, are brought in to worship God, and added to the church; and the last trumpet will gather the saints together.</body></html>
