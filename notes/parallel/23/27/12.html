The verb used is that which we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm" title="For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about on the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.">Isaiah 28:27</a> for the "beating out" of seeds from their husks, as a form of threshing. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-20.htm" title="When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.">Deuteronomy 24:20</a> it is used of the beating down of the olive crop. So understood, the words imply a promise, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm" title="Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, said the LORD God of Israel.">Isaiah 17:6</a>, but on a far wider scale. Instead of the gleaning of a few olives from the topmost boughs, there should be a full and abundant gathering, and yet each single olive, <span class= "ital">"</span>one by one" should receive an undivided care. Judah and Israel should once more be peopled as in the days of old, and the ideal boundaries or their territory should be restored.<p><span class= "bld">The channel,</span> or <span class= "ital">flood of the river, </span>is the Euphrates.<p><span class= "bld">The stream of Egypt.</span>--As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.">1Kings 8:65</a>, not the Nile, but the river which divides Palestine from Egypt, known by the Greeks as Rhinocolura, and now the <span class= "ital">Wady-el-'Arish.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - JUDAH PROMISED RESTORATION. The general practice of Isaiah is to append to gloomy prophecies words of encouragement He does this even when heathen nations are denounced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17, 18</a>); and still more when he is predicting judgments upon Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18-24</a>, etc.). The encouragement in this place is a promise of return after dispersion, and of re-establishment on the "holy mount at Jerusalem" (ver. 19). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall beat off</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "gather in his harvest." The metaphor is taken either from the beating of olive trees to obtain the berries (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>), or from the beating out of the grain by a threshing-flail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17</a>; and below. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>). Perhaps the best translation would be, <span class="accented">The Lord shall thresh</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>From the channel of the river</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from the strong stream of the river</span>. <span class="accented">As</span> usual, "the river" (<span class="accented">hannahar</span>) is the Euphrates (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-21.htm">Genesis 31:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2, 3, 14, 15</a>, etc.). Its "strong stream," or "flood," is contrasted with the scant thread of water which was alone to be found in the "Torrens AEgypti." <span class="cmt_word">The stream of Egypt</span> (<span class="accented">nachal Mizraim</span>) is generally allowed to be the modern <span class="accented">Wady el Arish</span>, which was appointed to be the southern boundary of the Holy Land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>). The Lord would collect within these limits all that were of Israel. He would also, as appears from the next verse, subsequently overstep the limits. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:6-13 In the days of the gospel, the latter days, the gospel church shall be more firmly fixed than the Jewish church, and shall spread further. May our souls be continually watered and kept, that we may abound in the fruits of the Spirit, in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. The Jews yet are kept a separate and a numerous people; they have not been rooted out as those who slew them. The condition of that nation, through so many ages, forms a certain proof of the Divine origin of the Scriptures; and the Jews live amongst us, a continued warning against sin. But though winds are ever so rough, ever so high, God can say to them, Peace, be still. And though God will afflict his people, yet he will make their afflictions to work for the good of their souls. According to this promise, since the captivity in Babylon, no people have shown such hatred to idols and idolatry as the Jews. And to all God's people, the design of affliction is to part between them and sin. The affliction has done us good, when we keep at a distance from the occasions of sin, and use care that we may not be tempted to it. Jerusalem had been defended by grace and the Divine protection; but when God withdrew, she was left like a wilderness. This has awfully come to pass. And this is a figure of the deplorable state of the vineyard, the church, when it brought forth wild grapes. Sinners flatter themselves they shall not be dealt with severely, because God is merciful, and is their Maker. We see how weak those pleas will be. Verses 12,13, seem to predict the restoration of the Jews after the Babylonish captivity, and their recovery from their present dispersion. This is further applicable to the preaching of the gospel, by which sinners are gathered into the grace of God; the gospel proclaims the acceptable year of the Lord. Those gathered by the sounding of the gospel trumpet, are brought in to worship God, and added to the church; and the last trumpet will gather the saints together.</body></html>
