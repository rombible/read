(Isaiah frequently ascribes "fury" to God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-2.htm">Isaiah 34:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 20, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3, 5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Who would set the briars and thorns against me in battle?</span> The "briars and thorns" are apparently unrighteous members of the Church, who have fallen below their privileges. God asks, "Who will set the briars and thorns in array against me?" in a tone of contempt. "Who will dare to do battle against me with such weak material?" And then he adds a forecast of the result in such a case: "I would move forward; I would burn them all together" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-5 The Lord Jesus with his strong sword, the virtue of his death, and the preaching of his gospel, does and will destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, that old serpent. The world is a fruitless, worthless wilderness; but the church is a vineyard, a place that has great care taken of it, and from which precious fruits are gathered. God will keep it in the night of affliction and persecution, and in the day of peace and prosperity, the temptations of which are not less dangerous. God also takes care of the fruitfulness of this vineyard. We need the continual waterings of Divine grace; if these be at any time withdrawn, we wither, and come to nothing. Though God sometimes contends with his people, yet he graciously waits to be reconciled unto them. It is true, when he finds briers and thorns instead of vines, and they are set in array against him, he will tread them down and burn them. Here is a summary of the doctrine of the gospel, with which the church is to be watered every moment. Ever since sin first entered, there has been, on God's part, a righteous quarrel, but, on man's part, most unrighteous. Here is a gracious invitation given. Pardoning mercy is called the power of our Lord; let us take hold on that. Christ crucified is the power of God. Let us by lively faith take hold on his strength who is a strength to the needy, believing there is no other name by which we can be saved, as a man that is sinking catches hold of a bough, or cord, or plank, that is in his reach. This is the only way, and it is a sure way, to be saved. God is willing to be reconciled to us.</body></html>
