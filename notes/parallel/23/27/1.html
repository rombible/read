The "sword of the Lord" (primarily, perhaps, representing the lightning-flash) is turned in its threefold character as sore, and swift, and strong, against three great empires. These are represented, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:">Ezekiel 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/7-3.htm" title="And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.">Daniel 7:3-7</a>, by monstrous forms of animal life. The "dragon" is as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-19.htm" title="These two things are come to you; who shall be sorry for you? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort you?">Isaiah 51:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>, the standing emblem of Egypt: the other two, so generically like, that the "leviathan" ("crocodile" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm" title="Can you draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which you let down?">Job 41:1</a>, but here, probably, generically for a monster of the serpent type) serves as a common type for both, while each has its distinctive epithet, may refer respectively to Assyria and Babylon, the epithets indicating (1) the rapid rush of the Tigris and the tortuous windings of the Euphrates; and (2) the policy characteristic of each empire, of which the rivers were looked upon as symbols, one rapidly aggressive, the other advancing as by a sinuous deceit. By some commentators, however, Egypt is represented in all three clauses; while others (Cheyne) see in them the symbols not of earthly empire, but of rebel powers of evil and darkness, quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/26-12.htm" title="He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.">Job 26:12-13</a> in support of his view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - THE TRIPLE JUDGMENT ON THE POWERS OF DARKNESS. The crowning judgment of all is now briefly described. "In that day" - the day of God's vengeance - when all his other enemies have been put down, Jehovah shall finally visit with his sword three mighty foes, which are described under three figures - the first as "Leviathan, the swift serpent;" the second as "Leviathan, the crooked serpent; "and the third as "the dragon that is in the sea." It has been usual to see in these three monsters three kingdoms inimical to God - either Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt; or Assyria, Egypt, and Tyre; or Media, Persia, and Egypt. But this diversity of interpretation shows that there is no particular fitness in the emblems to symbolize any special kingdoms or world-powers, while the imagery itself and the law of climax alike point to something higher than world-powers being intended. "Leviathan," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>, where the word first occurs, represents a supra-mundane power - probably "the dragon, the enemy of light, who in old Eastern traditions is conceived as ready to swallow up sun and moon, and plunge creation in original chaos or darkness" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 28); and the "dragon" is a customary emblem of Satan himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7, 9</a>), the prince of darkness. The triple vengeance here is parallel to the triple punishment, in the apocalyptic vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>), of "the devil," "the beast," and "the false prophet," who have been termed by commentators "the three great enemies of God's kingdom" (see 'Speaker's Commentary on the New Testament,' vol. 4. p. 802). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord with his sore and great and strong sword</span>. The "sword" of Jehovah is first heard of in the Pentateuch, where it is called" glittering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>). It is spoken of by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12</a>), and frequently by Isaiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; 46:16). Mr. Cheyne supposes the idea to have been taken from the Baby-Ionian mythology, and seems to think it half material. But it is merely on a par with other anthrepomorphisms. The word rendered "sore" probably means "well-tempered," "keen." <span class="cmt_word">Leviathan</span>. Etymologically, the term "Leviathan" appears to mean "that which is coiled" or "twisted," whence it would seem to have been primarily applied, as in the present verse, to serpents. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-34</a>, however, it manifestly designates the crocodile, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> it must be used of some kind of cetacean. Thus its most appropriate English rendering would be "monster." <span class="cmt_word">The piercing serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the fleet</span>, or <span class="accented">fugitive serpent</span>. It is a general characteristic of the snake tribe to glide away and hide themselves when disturbed. <span class="cmt_word">Even leviathan that crooked serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and also leviathan that crooked serpent</span>. It is quite clear that two distinct foes of God are pointed at - one characterized as "fleet," the other as "tortuous." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall slay the dragon.</span> Here is mention of a third enemy, probably Satan himself (see the introductory paragraph to this section). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-5 The Lord Jesus with his strong sword, the virtue of his death, and the preaching of his gospel, does and will destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, that old serpent. The world is a fruitless, worthless wilderness; but the church is a vineyard, a place that has great care taken of it, and from which precious fruits are gathered. God will keep it in the night of affliction and persecution, and in the day of peace and prosperity, the temptations of which are not less dangerous. God also takes care of the fruitfulness of this vineyard. We need the continual waterings of Divine grace; if these be at any time withdrawn, we wither, and come to nothing. Though God sometimes contends with his people, yet he graciously waits to be reconciled unto them. It is true, when he finds briers and thorns instead of vines, and they are set in array against him, he will tread them down and burn them. Here is a summary of the doctrine of the gospel, with which the church is to be watered every moment. Ever since sin first entered, there has been, on God's part, a righteous quarrel, but, on man's part, most unrighteous. Here is a gracious invitation given. Pardoning mercy is called the power of our Lord; let us take hold on that. Christ crucified is the power of God. Let us by lively faith take hold on his strength who is a strength to the needy, believing there is no other name by which we can be saved, as a man that is sinking catches hold of a bough, or cord, or plank, that is in his reach. This is the only way, and it is a sure way, to be saved. God is willing to be reconciled to us.</body></html>
