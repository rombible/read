Not content with praying God to look upon them once more with favour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>), Israel now asks for a theophany, or manifestation of the Divine Presence, such as they have experienced in the times of old, and such as shall suffice to strike terror into the hearts of their enemies (vers. 1-4). With profound humility confessing their manifold and grievous iniquities, they beseech God once more, as their Father and Maker, to have pity upon them, reminding him of the desolate condition of Judaea and Jerusalem, and urging him no longer to "refrain himself" (vers. 5-12). "The manner," as Mr. Cheyne observes, "is that of a liturgical psalm; the prophet, as it were, leads the devotions of the assembled Church," and utters in impassioned language the feelings which deeply move them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou wouldest rend the</span> <span class="cmt_word">heavens!</span> God "dwells in the thick darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-1.htm">2 Chronicles 6:1</a>). "Thick clouds are a covering to him" as he "walketh in the circuit of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a>). The Church would have the covering "rent," and God show himself openly, both to his people and to their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest come down!</span> God" came down" ou Sinai in the sight of all the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-11.htm">Exodus 19:11, 20</a>). David saw him in vision "bow the heavens and <span class="accented">come down</span>; and there was darkness under his feet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>). It is such an "epiphany" which the Church now desires - a revelation of God in all his glory, in his might as against "the nations" (ver. 2), in his mercifulness as towards themselves. <span class="cmt_word">That the mountains might flow down</span>; or, <span class="accented">quake.</span> When God descended on Sinai, "the whole mount quaked greatly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). When he appeared to David, "the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>). When he was seen of Elijah, "a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; and after the wind was an earthquake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>). Micah saw the Lord "coming forth out of his place," and "the mountains were molten under him, and the valleys cleft" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3, 4</a>). The mountains represent that which is most firm and solid and strong upon the face of the earth. If even they "melt and flow and tremble" at the presence of God, what might must his be! And who may abide him? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/64.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>64:1-5 They desire that God would manifest himself to them and for them, so that all may see it. This is applicable to the second coming of Christ, when the Lord himself shall descend from heaven. They plead what God had used to do, and had declared his gracious purpose to do, for his people. They need not fear being disappointed of it, for it is sure; or disappointed in it, for it is sufficient. The happiness of his people is bound up in what God has designed for them, and is preparing for them, and preparing them for; what he has done or will do. Can we believe this, and then think any thing too great to expect from his truth, power, and love? It is spiritual and cannot be comprehended by human understanding. It is ever ready. See what communion there is between a gracious God and a gracious soul. We must make conscience of doing our duty in every thing the Lord our God requires. Thou meetest him; this speaks his freeness and forwardness in doing them good. Though God has been angry with us for our sins, and justly, yet his anger has soon ended; but in his favour is life, which goes on and continues, and on that we depend for our salvation.</body></html>
