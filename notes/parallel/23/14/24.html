From the distant prospect of an ultimate deliverance from the power of Babylon, the prophet turns his gaze to a nearer, if not a greater, deliverance. The present enemy is Assyria. It is she who has carried Samaria into captivity, and who now threatens the independence of Judah. Deliverance from her has already been promised more than once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-19, 25-27, 33, 34</a>); but apparently the people are not reassured - they still dread the foe who is so near, and who seems so irresistible. God, therefore, condescends to give them a fresh prophecy, a fresh assurance, and to confirm it to them <span class="accented">by an oath</span> (ver. 24). The Assyrian power shall be broken - her yoke shall be cast off (ver. 25); God has declared his purpose, and nothing can hinder it (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath sworn</span>. This is the emphatic word - the <span class="accented">new</span> thing in the prophecy. God but seldom declares his purposes <span class="accented">with an oath - never</span> but in condescension to the weakness of his creatures, who, though they misdoubt his word, can feel the immutability of an oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a>), and yield it the credence and the confidence which they refuse to a bare assertion. <span class="cmt_word">As I have thought... as I have purposed</span>. A reference to the prophecies previously given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">So shall it come to pass</span>; literally, <span class="accented">so it hath been</span> - a striking instance of the "<span class="accented">preterite</span> of prophetic certainty." <span class="cmt_word">So shall it stand</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as I have purposed</span>, <span class="accented">that shall stand</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:24-27 Let those that make themselves a yoke and a burden to God's people, see what they are to expect. Let those that are the called according to God's purpose, comfort themselves, that whatever God has purposed, it shall stand. The Lord of hosts has purposed to break the Assyrian's yoke; his hand is stretched out to execute this purpose; who has power to turn it back? By such dispensations of providence, the Almighty shows in the most convincing manner, that sin is hateful in his sight.</body></html>
