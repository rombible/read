Even in Sheol the kings of the earth retain their former majesty, and sit on thrones apart from the vulgar dead. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/32-17.htm" title="It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a> we have a reproduction of the same imagery, and the kings appear, each with his "weapons of war." The whole passage finds a striking parallel in the Assyrian legend of the Descent of Ishtar (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, i.</span> p. 144), where Hades is described.<p>"The abode of darkness and famine.<p>* * * * * *<p>Night is not seen--in darkness they dwell.<p>Ghosts, like birds, flutter their wings there.<p>On the door and gate-posts the dust lies undisturbed.<p>* * * * * * *<p>To be the ruler of a palace shall be thy rank;<p>A throne of state shall be thy seat."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hell from beneath</span>. The Hebrew <span class="accented">Sheol</span> corresponded nearly to the Greek Hades, and the Latin <span class="accented">Inferi</span>. It was a dismal region in the center of the earth, whither departed souls descended, and where they remained thenceforth. There were various depths in it, each apparently more dismal than the preceding; but there is no evidence that it was considered to contain any place of happiness, until after the return from the Captivity. The prophet here represents <span class="accented">Sheol</span> as disturbed by the advent of the Babylonian monarch, and as rousing itself to receive him. The great ones of the earth, and the kings, who are kings even in Hades, and sit upon thrones, are especially moved by the occasion, and prepare to meet and greet their brother. Personal identity and continued consciousness of it after death are assumed; and the former earthly rank of the inmates seems to be recognized and maintained. <span class="cmt_word">It stirreth up the dead</span>. Hell in the aggregate - the place personified - proceeds to arouse the individual inmates, who are called <span class="accented">re-phaim - </span> the word commonly translated "giants" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-12.htm">Joshua 13:12</a>, etc.), but meaning properly "feeble ones." The shades or ghosts of the departed were regarded as weak and nerveless, in comparison with living men (compare the Homeric <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">All the chief ones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the he-goats</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-40.htm">Jeremiah 51:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>). Raised up from their thrones; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "caused to rise up from their thrones," and stand in eager expectation of what was about to happen. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-23 The whole plan of Divine Providence is arranged with a view to the good of the people of God. A settlement in the land of promise is of God's mercy. Let the church receive those whom God receives. God's people, wherever their lot is cast, should endeavour to recommend religion by a right and winning conversation. Those that would not be reconciled to them, should be humbled by them. This may be applied to the success of the gospel, when those were brought to obey it who had opposed it. God himself undertakes to work a blessed change. They shall have rest from their sorrow and fear, the sense of their present burdens, and the dread of worse. Babylon abounded in riches. The king of Babylon having the absolute command of so much wealth, by the help of it ruled the nations. This refers especially to the people of the Jews; and it filled up the measure of the king of Babylon's sins. Tyrants sacrifice their true interest to their lusts and passions. It is gracious ambition to covet to be like the Most Holy, for he has said, Be ye holy, for I am holy; but it is sinful ambition to aim to be like the Most High, for he has said, He who exalts himself shall be abased. The devil thus drew our first parents to sin. Utter ruin should be brought upon him. Those that will not cease to sin, God will make to cease. He should be slain, and go down to the grave; this is the common fate of tyrants. True glory, that is, true grace, will go up with the soul to heaven, but vain pomp will go down with the body to the grave; there is an end of it. To be denied burial, if for righteousness' sake, may be rejoiced in, Mt 5:12. But if the just punishment of sin, it denotes that impenitent sinners shall rise to everlasting shame and contempt. Many triumphs should be in his fall. God will reckon with those that disturb the peace of mankind. The receiving the king of Babylon into the regions of the dead, shows there is a world of spirits, to which the souls of men remove at death. And that souls have converse with each other, though we have none with them; and that death and hell will be death and hell indeed, to all who fall unholy, from the height of this world's pomps, and the fulness of its pleasures. Learn from all this, that the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned. The royal city is to be ruined and forsaken. Thus the utter destruction of the New Testament Babylon is illustrated, Re 18:2. When a people will not be made clean with the besom of reformation, what can they expect but to be swept off the face of the earth with the besom of destruction?</body></html>
