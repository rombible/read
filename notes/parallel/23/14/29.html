i.e., </span>give not thyself wholly to rejoicing. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm" title="The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.">Exodus 15:14</a>, "Palestina" is used, not in the wider meaning with which we are familiar, but specifically as the country of the Philistines. The historical circumstances connected with the "oracle" before us are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm" title="Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.">2Chronicles 18:18</a>. The Philistines had invaded the low country (<span class= "ital">Shetph</span>?<span class= "ital">lah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the district known as the <span class= "ital">Negeb, </span>or "south" of Judah, in the reign of Ahaz. He had called in the help of Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian king, to assist him as against Rezin and Pekah (Isaiah 7), so probably against these new invaders. Sargon (who succeeded Tiglath-pileser, B.C. 723) invaded Ashdod in B.C. 710 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>; <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 40). Sennacherib records a like attack on Ashkelon and (according to Rawlinson's interpretation) Ekron (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 61). With these data we are able to enter on the interpretation of Isaiah's prediction.<p><span class= "bld">Because the rod of him that smote thee is broken.</span>--The "rod," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:24</a>, is the power of Tiglath-pileser. The Philistines were exulting in his death, or in that of Ahaz as his ally, as though their peril was past. They are told that their exultation was premature.<p><span class= "bld">Out of the serpent's root.</span>--The three forms of serpent life (we need not be careful about their identification from the zoologist's point of view) may represent the three Assyrian kings named above, from whose invasions the Philistines were to suffer. Each form was more terrible than the preceding. The fiery flying serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm" title="The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm" title="And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.">Numbers 21:6</a>), which represented Sennacherib, was the most formidable of the three. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm" title="In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.">Isaiah 27:1</a>, the "piercing serpent," the "crooked serpent," and the "dragon" are symbols of the Assyrian power. Some critics, however, led chiefly by the first words of the next verse, find in the three serpents--(1) Ahaz, (2) Hezekiah, (3) the ideal king of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whole Palestina</span>. The Greeks called Philistia <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, or "Syria of the Philistines," whence the Latin "Palestina" and our "Palestine." Isaiah addresses the country as "whole Palestine," because, while it was made up of a number of principalities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>), his message concerned it in its entirety. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of him that smote thee is broken.</span> This can scarcely refer to the death of Ahaz, since Ahaz did not smite the Philistines, but was smitten by them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). It may, however, refer to the death of Tiglath-Pileser, which took place only a year or two previously. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a more poisonous serpent (see note on Isaiah 11:8). Shal-maneser can scarcely be meant, since he does not, appear to have attacked the Philistines. Probably Sargon is intended, who "took Ashdod" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>), made Khanun, King of Gaza, prisoner ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 5), and reduced Philtstia generally to subjection. <span class="cmt_word">And his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent</span>. The fruit of the cockatrice will be even more terrible and venomous. He will resemble the "fiery flying serpent" of the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>). Sennacherib is, perhaps, this "fruit." He con<span class="accented">quered</span> Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 432) and Ekron (ibid., p. 433), and had the kings of Gaze and Ashdod among his tributaries (ibid., p. 438, note 11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:28-32 Assurance is given of the destruction of the Philistines and their power, by famine and war. Hezekiah would be more terrible to them than Uzziah had been. Instead of rejoicing, there would be lamentation, for the whole land would be ruined. Such destruction will come upon the proud and rebellious, but the Lord founded Zion for a refuge to poor sinners, who flee from the wrath to come, and trust in his mercy through Christ Jesus. Let us tell all around of our comforts and security, and exhort them to seek the same refuge and salvation.</body></html>
