The LXX. often translates it by "cypress," the Vulgate and Authorised version commonly by "fir tree." Its wood was largely used in house and ship-building, but was less precious than the cedar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm" title="So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.">1Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-15.htm" title="And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.">1Kings 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-34.htm" title="And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.">1Kings 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-19.htm" title="I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:">Isaiah 41:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm" title="They have made all your ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for you.">Ezekiel 27:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">No feller is come up against us</span>--The literal and figurative senses melt into each other, the former perhaps being the more prominent. It was the boast of Assurbanipal and other Assyrian kings that wherever they conquered they cut down forests and left the land bare. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm" title="By your servants have you reproached the Lord, and have said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.">Isaiah 37:24</a> : <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 86.) As the fir tree, the cedar, and the oak were the natural symbols of kingly rule (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-7.htm" title="And I will prepare destroyers against you, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:">Ezekiel 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm" title="Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.">Ezekiel 31:3</a>), this devastation represented the triumph of the Chaldaean king over other princes. On his downfall, the trees on the mountain, the kings and chieftains in their palaces, would alike rejoice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fir trees...cedars</span>. We may detect a double meaning here - one literal, the other metaphorical. Literally, the trees of Lebanon and the other mountain ranges would be spared, since, while both the Assyrian and Babylonian kings cut timber in the Syrian forests for building purposes, the Persians had no such practice; metaphorically, the firs and cedars are the kings and nobles of the countries (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>), who likewise had a respite. <span class="cmt_word">Since</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou art laid down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">since thou liest low</span>. The first stanza here ends, and the second begins with the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-23 The whole plan of Divine Providence is arranged with a view to the good of the people of God. A settlement in the land of promise is of God's mercy. Let the church receive those whom God receives. God's people, wherever their lot is cast, should endeavour to recommend religion by a right and winning conversation. Those that would not be reconciled to them, should be humbled by them. This may be applied to the success of the gospel, when those were brought to obey it who had opposed it. God himself undertakes to work a blessed change. They shall have rest from their sorrow and fear, the sense of their present burdens, and the dread of worse. Babylon abounded in riches. The king of Babylon having the absolute command of so much wealth, by the help of it ruled the nations. This refers especially to the people of the Jews; and it filled up the measure of the king of Babylon's sins. Tyrants sacrifice their true interest to their lusts and passions. It is gracious ambition to covet to be like the Most Holy, for he has said, Be ye holy, for I am holy; but it is sinful ambition to aim to be like the Most High, for he has said, He who exalts himself shall be abased. The devil thus drew our first parents to sin. Utter ruin should be brought upon him. Those that will not cease to sin, God will make to cease. He should be slain, and go down to the grave; this is the common fate of tyrants. True glory, that is, true grace, will go up with the soul to heaven, but vain pomp will go down with the body to the grave; there is an end of it. To be denied burial, if for righteousness' sake, may be rejoiced in, Mt 5:12. But if the just punishment of sin, it denotes that impenitent sinners shall rise to everlasting shame and contempt. Many triumphs should be in his fall. God will reckon with those that disturb the peace of mankind. The receiving the king of Babylon into the regions of the dead, shows there is a world of spirits, to which the souls of men remove at death. And that souls have converse with each other, though we have none with them; and that death and hell will be death and hell indeed, to all who fall unholy, from the height of this world's pomps, and the fulness of its pleasures. Learn from all this, that the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned. The royal city is to be ruined and forsaken. Thus the utter destruction of the New Testament Babylon is illustrated, Re 18:2. When a people will not be made clean with the besom of reformation, what can they expect but to be swept off the face of the earth with the besom of destruction?</body></html>
