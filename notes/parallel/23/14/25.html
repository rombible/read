This is referred by some critics to the miraculous destruction of Sennacherib's army, and regarded as a proof that the scene, of that destruction was Judaea. But it is possible that a disaster to the forces of Sargon may be intended (see the comment on Isaiah 10:28-32). <span class="cmt_word">His yoke shall depart from off them</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>). The Assyrian yoke, imposed by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-10</a>), and (according to his own inscriptions) again by Sargon, was thrown off by Hezekiah, who "rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>). It was this rebellion that provoked the expedition of Sennacherib, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>; and it may be this rejection of the yoke which is here prophesied. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:24-27 Let those that make themselves a yoke and a burden to God's people, see what they are to expect. Let those that are the called according to God's purpose, comfort themselves, that whatever God has purposed, it shall stand. The Lord of hosts has purposed to break the Assyrian's yoke; his hand is stretched out to execute this purpose; who has power to turn it back? By such dispensations of providence, the Almighty shows in the most convincing manner, that sin is hateful in his sight.</body></html>
