The date of that which comes next in order is obviously specified, either by Isaiah himself or by the compiler of his prophecies, that it might be seen that it was not a prophecy after the event. The death-year of Ahaz was B.C. 727. It was natural that the prophet's thoughts should be much exercised then, as in the year of Uzziah's death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>), on the uncertainties of the coming future, and the "burden" was the answer to his searchings of heart. It was probably delivered <span class= "ital">before </span>the king's death. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-32.</span> - THE BURDEN OF PHILISTIA. The Philistines had suffered grievously at the hands of Judah in the reign of Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), and had retaliated in the reign of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). It would seem that after this they were invaded by Tiglath-Pileser, who penetrated as far as Gaza, which lie took ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 51) and made tributary, as he also did Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 399). Tiglath-Pileser died shortly before Ahaz, and the present "burden" seems to have been uttered in connection with his death. Isaiah warns Philistia (equivalent to "<span class="accented">Palestina"</span>) that her rejoicing is premature; Tiglath-Pileser will have successors as powerful and as cruel as himself, and these successors will carry destruction and ravage over the whole land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that King Ahaz died was this burden</span>. These words introduce the "burden of Philistia," and shows that it is chronologically out of place, since the prophecies from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10</a>. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1-27</a> have belonged to the reign of Hezekiah. Ahaz appears to have died early in <span class="date">B.C. 725</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:28-32 Assurance is given of the destruction of the Philistines and their power, by famine and war. Hezekiah would be more terrible to them than Uzziah had been. Instead of rejoicing, there would be lamentation, for the whole land would be ruined. Such destruction will come upon the proud and rebellious, but the Lord founded Zion for a refuge to poor sinners, who flee from the wrath to come, and trust in his mercy through Christ Jesus. Let us tell all around of our comforts and security, and exhort them to seek the same refuge and salvation.</body></html>
