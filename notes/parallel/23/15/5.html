for I cannot do anything till you be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.">Genesis 19:22</a>), in the wild scare as of a frightened heifer as yet untamed by the yoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-18.htm" title="I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the LORD my God.">Jeremiah 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm" title="From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.">Jeremiah 48:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.">Jeremiah 1:11</a>). The English "fugitives" answers to the marginal reading of the Hebrew, the text of which (followed by the Vulg.) gives, "his bars reach unto Zoar;" but it is not easy to connect this with the context.<p><span class= "bld">By the mounting up of Luhith . . .</span>--No city has been identified as bearing this name. Probably "the <span class= "ital">ascent of Luhith</span>" (the name may indicate a staircase of boards) was the well-known approach (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-5.htm" title="For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.">Jeremiah 48:5</a>) to a Moabite sanctuary. Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Onomast.</span>) speaks of it as between Zoar and Areopolis (Rabbath Moab). Horonaim (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-3.htm" title="A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.">Jeremiah 48:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-5.htm" title="For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.">Jeremiah 48:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm" title="From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.">Jeremiah 48:34</a>) is as little known as its companion. The name, which in Hebrew means "two caverns," is, perhaps, descriptive of the nature of the sanctuary. The point of the description is that the fugitives when they reach Horonaim, are met with the cry of destruction, "All is over."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My heart shall cry out for Moab</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9, 11</a>). The prophet sympathizes with the sufferings of Moab, as a kindred people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and perhaps as having, in the person of Ruth, furnished an ancestress to the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His fugitives</span>; literally, <span class="accented">her fugitives</span>. The <span class="accented">country</span> is here personified, instead of the <span class="accented">people</span>, the former being feminine, the latter masculine. <span class="cmt_word">Shall flee</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto Zoar</span>. Zoar, the "little" town, spared for Lot's sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-20.htm">Genesis 19:20-22</a>), is placed by some at the northern, by others at the southern, extremity of the Dead Sea. The present passage makes in favor of the more southern site. <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old</span>. Those who defend this rendering refer the simile either to Zest, or to Moab, or to the fugitives. Having regard to the parallel passage of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 48:34), we may pronounce the last explanation to be the best. The resemblance to the heifer will consist in the cries uttered. To ninny critics, however, this idea appears harsh, and the alternative is proposed of regarding <span class="accented">Eglath -</span> the word translated "heifer" - as a place, and the epithet, "of three years <span class="accented">old</span>," as really meaning "the third." Attempts are made to show the existence of three Eglaths in these parts; but they are not very successful; nor is any instance adduced of a city being distinguished from others of the same name by a numerical suffix. The rendering of the Authorized Version may therefore stand, the comparison being regarded as one of the fugitive Moabites to a heifer in its third year, "<span class="accented">rushing</span> along with loud, hopeless bellowings" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">By the mounting up of Luhith</span>. This ascent has not been identified. It should have been on the way from Moab proper to Zoar. <span class="cmt_word">The way of Horonaim</span>. On the Moabite Stone Horonaim is mentioned as a town of the Edomites attacked and taken by Mesha (11:31-33). It lay probably south or southeast of the Dead Sea. The Moabites, flying kern their invaders, seek a refuge in the territories of Edom and Judah, weeping and wailing as they go. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites. - This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm the prophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies. Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.</body></html>
