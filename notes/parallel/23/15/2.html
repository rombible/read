In this and in the "high places" (<span class= "ital">Bamoth</span>) we may probably recognise the Bamoth-baal (high places of Baal) which appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm" title="Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,">Joshua 13:17</a>, side by side with Dibon, and the Beth-Bamoth of the Moabite stone (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> 167). That stone was, it may be noted, found at <span class= "ital">Diban, </span>which stands on two hills, and represents the ancient city of that name.

Mesha boasts of having taken it, and slain seven thousand men (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> 166). Medeba is named by him (<span class= "ital">ib.</span>) as having been taken by Omri, and held by the Israelites for forty years.<p><span class= "bld">On all their heads shall be baldness . . .</span>--This, originally, perhaps, sacrificial in its character, became at a very early period a symbol of intensest sorrow among Eastern nations. It was forbidden to Israel, probably as identified with the worship of other deities than Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm" title="They shall not make baldness on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.">Leviticus 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm" title="Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm" title="Make you bald, and poll you for your delicate children; enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you.">Micah 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm" title="And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.">Amos 8:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is gone to Bajith</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he is gone to the temple</span>. Probably the temple of Baal at Beth-baal-meon is intended. Beth-baal-meon is 'mentioned in close connection with Dibon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And to Dibon</span>.

It was an ancient Moabite town of considerable importance, and has recently been identified with the site called <span class="accented">Diban</span>, where the Moabite Stone was found. This place is situated in the country east of the Dead Sea, about three miles north of the river Arnon, on the old Roman road connecting Rabbath-Moab with Hesh-bob. The town seems to have gained in importance from the fact that it was the birthplace of Chemosh-Gad, Mesha's father (Moabite Stone, 1. 2). Mesha added to its territory (ibid., 1.21). It is extremely probable that it was the site of one of the Moabite "high places," and was therefore naturally one of the places whereto the Moabites, when afflicted, went up" to weep." <span class="cmt_word">Over Nebo, and over Medeba</span>. Nebe and Medeba were also ancient Moabite towns. Nebo is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-8.htm">1 Chronicles 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1, 22</a>. It seems to have lain almost midway between Beth-baal-meon (Main) and Medeba, about three or four miles south-east of Heshbon. Medeba obtains notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>. Mesha says that it was taken from the Moabites by Omri, King of Israel, but recovered by himself at the end of forty 'years (Moabite Stone, 11. 7-9). It lay south-east of Hesh-ben, at the spot which still retains the old name <span class="accented">- Madeba</span>. It has been suggested that there was at Nebo a shrine of the Baby-Ionian god so named; but this is to assume a resemblance which the facts at present known do not indicate, between the Moabite and Babylonian religions. <span class="cmt_word">On all their heads shall be baldness</span>. The practice of cutting off the hair in mourning was common to the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>) with various other nations; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the Persians (Herod., 9:24), the Greeks, the Macedonians (Pint., 'Vit. Pelop.,' &sect; 34), the primitive Arabs (Krehl, 'Religion der voris-lamit. Araber,' p. 33, note 1), and the North American Indians (Bancroft,' Native Races of America'). It was probably intended, like lacerations, and ashes on the head, as a mere disfigurement, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites. - This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm the prophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies. Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.</body></html>
