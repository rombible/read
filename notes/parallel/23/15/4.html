It had probably fallen into the hands of the Moabites, to whom it had originally belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm" title="For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.">Numbers 21:26</a>). Its ruins exhibit architecture of various periods, Jewish, Roman, and Saracenic; (2) Elealeh, obviously near Heshbon, had shared its fate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm" title="And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,">Numbers 32:37</a>). The ancient name still attaches to its ruins in the form <span class= "ital">El-A'al; </span>(3) Jahaz was the scene of the battle between Sihon and the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm" title="And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.">Numbers 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-32.htm" title="Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.">Deuteronomy 2:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-20.htm" title="But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.">Judges 11:20</a>), and was also within the region assigned to Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-10.htm" title="And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;">Joshua 13:10</a>) north of the Arnon. The language of Isaiah implies that it was at some distance from the other two cities. Their cry was to be heard even there. In the Moabite inscription it appears as annexed to Dibon (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>xi. 167). Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Onomast.</span>) names it as between Medeba and <span class= "ital">Debus, </span>the latter name being probably identical with Dibon. The panic is intensified by the fact that even the "armed soldiers" of Moab are powerless to help, and can only join in the ineffectual wailing.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heshbon shall cry</span>. Heshbon, now <span class="accented">Hesban</span>, lay about twenty miles east of the Jordan, nearly on the parallel of its embouchure into the Dead Sea. It was the capital city of Sihon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21</a>), who took it from the Moabites. On the partition of Palestine among the tribes of Israel, it was assigned to Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>); but at a later time we find it reckoned to Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81</a>). We do not know at what time Moab recovered Heshbon, but may conjecture that it was one of the conquests of Mesha, though it is not mentioned on the Moabite Stone. <span class="cmt_word">And Elealeh</span>. Elealch is commonly united with Heshbon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>). It is probably identical with the modern <span class="accented">El-A'al</span>, a ruined town on the top of a rounded hill, little more than a mile north of <span class="accented">Hesban</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Even unto Jahaz</span>. Jahaz lay considerably to the south of Hesh-ben, probably not very far north of the Arnon. It must have been in the vicinity of Dibon, since Mesha, on taking it from the Israelites, annexed it to the territory of that city (Moabite Stone, II. 19-21). It was the scene of the great battle between Sihon and the Israelites under Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His life shall be grievous unto him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his soul shall be grieved within him</span>. The Moabite people is personified (Cheyne). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites. - This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm the prophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies. Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In ver. 6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.</body></html>
