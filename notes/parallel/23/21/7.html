They probably indicate, the former an Arab, the latter a Carmanian contingent. Both are named (11,173 asses, 5,230 camels) among the spoil taken by Sennacherib on the defeat of Merodach-baladan (Bellino Tablet in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 26).<p><span class= "bld">He hearkened diligently with much heed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">he listened sharply, listened sharply, </span>with the iteration of intensity. What had met the watchman's eye in his vision had passed by in silence, and had left him in doubt as to its meaning.

He listened, but no voice came out of the darkness to interpret the vision for him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he saw... he hearkened</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he shall see</span>... he <span class="accented">shall hearken</span> (Kay).

This is exactly how a cavalry force was ordinarily represented by the Assyrians. Chariots are not intended either here or in ver. 9. They were not employed by the Persians until a late period of their history (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 113, 122). <span class="cmt_word">A chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels</span>; rather, <span class="accented">men mounted on asses and on camels</span>. It is well known that both animals were employed by the Persians in their expeditions to carry the baggage (Herod., 1:80; 4:129; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:1, etc.). But neither animal was ever attached to a chariot. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 Babylon was a flat country, abundantly watered. The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.</body></html>
