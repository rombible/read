Tema is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Taima</span>, a village of the Hauran, on the caravan route between Palmyra and Peira. <span class="accented">Its</span> inhabitants are exhorted to bring water to the thirsty Dedanites, as they pass along this route with their "travelling companies." (For other mentions of Tome, which must not be confounded with Teman, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">They prevented with their bread him that fled.</span> Several commentators take this clause as imperative, like the last, and render, "With his bread meet the fugitive;" but the existing Hebrew <span class="accented">text</span> seems to require the rendering of the Authorized Version. Dr. Kay understands the prophet to mean that the men of Tema did not need exhortation; already of their own accord had they given of their bread to the fugitive Dedanites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:13-17 The Arabians lived in tents, and kept cattle. A destroying army shall be brought upon them, and make them an easy prey. We know not what straits we may be brought into before we die. Those may know the want of necessary food who now eat bread to the full. Neither the skill of archers, nor the courage of mighty men, can protect from the judgments of God. That is poor glory, which will thus quickly come to nothing. Thus hath the Lord said to me; and no word of his shall fall to the ground. We may be sure the Strength of Israel will not lie. Happy are those only whose riches and glory are out of the reach of invaders; all other prosperity will speedily pass away.</body></html>
