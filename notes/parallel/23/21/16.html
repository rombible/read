"Kedar" is a name of greater note than either Dedan or Tome. It seems to be used here as inclusive of Dedan, perhaps as a designation of the northern Arabians generally. The people of Kedar, like those of Dedan, carried on trade with Tyro (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>). They dwelt partly in tents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>), partly in villages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>), and were rich in flocks and herds and in camels. Though not mentioned in the inscriptions of Sargon, Sennacherib, or Esarhaddon, the contemporaries of Isaiah, they hold a prominent place in those of Esarhaddon's son and successor, Asshurbanipal, with whom they carried on a war of some considerable duration in conjunction with the Nabathaeans (G.

A destroying army shall be brought upon them, and make them an easy prey. We know not what straits we may be brought into before we die. Those may know the want of necessary food who now eat bread to the full. Neither the skill of archers, nor the courage of mighty men, can protect from the judgments of God. That is poor glory, which will thus quickly come to nothing. Thus hath the Lord said to me; and no word of his shall fall to the ground. We may be sure the Strength of Israel will not lie. Happy are those only whose riches and glory are out of the reach of invaders; all other prosperity will speedily pass away.</body></html>
