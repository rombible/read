<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-52.htm" title="Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,">Joshua 15:52</a>), but these are not in the direction of Seir. Probably here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm" title="The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.">Isaiah 21:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm" title="The burden of the valley of vision. What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?">Isaiah 22:1</a>, we have a mystical prophetic name, Edom being altered to Dumah, <span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>silence," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm" title="Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelled in silence.">Psalm 94:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm" title="The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.">Psalm 115:17</a>, the silence of the grave. In this case, as in the preceding, there is first the oppressive silence of expectancy, and then of desolation.<p><span class= "bld">He calleth . . . out of Seir . . .</span>--The subject is indefinite: <span class= "ital">one calleth. </span>The watchman hears the silence of the night broken by a voice from Seir. It is probable that the prophet had actually been consulted by the Edomites, and that this is his answer to their enquiries. The cry is, "Watchman, what <span class= "ital">part </span>of the night?" In the weary night of calamity the sufferer desires to know what hour it is, how much of the darkness still remains to be lived through. The answer is mysterious and ill-boding. There is a "morning" coming, a time of light and hope, but the day which is so opened closes too quickly in the blackness of night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm" title="Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.">Amos 5:18</a>). The words sum up the whole future of Edom, subject as it was to one conqueror after another, rising now and then, as under Herod and the Romans, and then sinking to its present desolation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - THE BURDEN OF DUMAH. This short "burden" is probably to be understood as uttered with reference to Edom, which the prophet prefers to call "<span class="accented">Dumah</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">silence</span>," in reference to the desolation which he sees to be coming upon the country. Such a play upon words is very usual in the East. Isaiah has already given an instance of it in the name under which he has designated Heliopolis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dumah</span>. There were at least two towns of this name ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 459, 460); but neither of them is in the district of Seir. It is best, therefore, to regard "<span class="accented">Dumah"</span> here as representing Edom, or Iaumaea (so the LXX., Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">Kay</span>, Cheyne, and others). <span class="cmt_word">He calleth to me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">one calleth to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I seem to hear a call from Mount Seir, as of one making inquiry of me. There is no need to suppose that the inquiry was actually made. Mount Self, or the district south-south-east of the Dead Sea, was the heart of the Idumaean country, which thence extended vaguely eastward and westward. <span class="cmt_word">What of the night</span>? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what hour, or, rather, perhaps, what watch of the night is it? May we consider that "<span class="accented">the</span> night is far spent, and the day at hand? Edom had offended Sargon by joining with Ashdod (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130), and was probably at tiffs time oppressed by Sargon in consequence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:11,12 God's prophets and ministers are as watchmen in the city in a time of peace, to see that all is safe. As watchmen in the camp in time of war, to warn of the motions of the enemy. After a long sleep in sin and security, it is time to rise, to awake out of sleep. We have a great deal of work to do, a long journey to go; it is time to be stirring. After a long dark night is there any hope of the day dawning? What tidings of the night? What happens to-night? We must never be secure. But many make curious inquiries of the watchmen. They would willingly have nice questions solved, or difficult prophecies interpreted; but they do not seek into the state of their own souls, about the way of salvation, and the path of duty. The watchman answers by way of prophecy. There comes first a morning of light, and peace, and opportunity; but afterward comes a night of trouble and calamity. If there be a morning of youth and health, there will come a night of sickness and old age; if a morning of prosperity in the family, in the public, yet we must look for changes. It is our wisdom to improve the present morning, in preparation for the night that is coming after it. Inquire, return, come. We are urged to do it quickly, for there is no time to trifle. Those that return and come to God, will find they have a great deal of work to do, and but little time to do it in.</body></html>
