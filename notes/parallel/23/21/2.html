<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 42, 44), "removing landmarks." (2) The summons to Elam and Media to put an end to this tyranny. (3) The oppressed peoples ceasing to sigh, and rejoicing in their liberation.<p>Elam appears here as combined with Media, which is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm" title="Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.">Isaiah 13:17</a> as the only destroyer of Babylon, and this has been urged as evidence of a later date. As a matter of fact, however, Sargon at this very time was carrying on a fierce war against Elam (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, cvii.</span> 41-49) as well as against Media (<span class= "ital">ibid, </span>p. 37). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm" title="There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, Elam is numbered among the extinct nations, but the name, at all events, re-appears as applied to the Persians, though they were of a distinct race. It was, even as a mere forecast, perfectly natural that the two should be associated together as the future destroyers of the Nineveh and Babel empires, which to the prophet's eye were identical in character and policy. The advance described as "from the wilderness" implies a march of part at least of the Medo-Persian army down the Choaspes and into the lowland of Chuzistan, bordering on the great Arabian desert.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A grievous vision</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">hard vision</span>; not, however, "hard of interpretation" (Kay), but rather "hard to be borne," "grievous," "calamitous." <span class="cmt_word">The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">the robber robs</span> (Knobel); or, <span class="accented">the violent man uses violence</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The idea of faithlessness passes out of the Hebrew <span class="accented">boged</span> occasionally, and is unsuitable here, more especially if it is the army of Cyrus that is intended. <span class="cmt_word">Go up,</span> <span class="cmt_word">O Elam</span>. The discovery that Cyrus, at the time of his conquest of Babylon, Bore the title of "King of Ansan," not "King of Persia," coupled with the probability that "Ansan" was a part of Elam, lends a peculiar interest to these words. Isaiah could not describe Cyrus as "King of Persia," and at the same time be intelligible to his contemporaries, since Persia was a country utterly unknown to them. In using the term "Elam" instead, he uses that of a country known to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>), adjoining Persia, and, at the time of his expedition against Babylon, subject to Cyrus. <span class="cmt_word">Besiege, O Media</span>. Having given "Elam" the first place, the prophet assigns to Media the second. Eleven years before he attacked Babylon, Cyrus had made war upon Astyages (Istuvegu), King of the Medes, had captured him, and become king of the nation, with scarcely any opposition (see the 'Cylinder of Nabonidus'). Hence the Medes would naturally form an important portion of the force which he led against Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">All the sighing thereof have I made to cease</span>. The "sighing" caused by Babylon to the nations, to the captives, and to the kings whose prison-doors were kept closed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>), God has in his counsels determined to bring to an end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 Babylon was a flat country, abundantly watered. The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.</body></html>
