The "sea" has been explained (1) as the Euphrates, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm" title="That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!">Isaiah 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm" title="And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.">Isaiah 19:5</a>, it appears as used of the Nile (Cheyne). (2) As pointing to the surging flood of the mingled myriads of its population. (3) Xenophon's description of the whole plain of the Euphrates, intersected by marshes and lakes, as looking like a sea affords, perhaps, a better explanation.<p><span class= "bld">As whirlwinds in the south . . .</span>--The "South" (or <span class= "ital">Negeb</span>) is here, as elsewhere, the special name of the country lying south of Judah. The tempests of the region seem to have been proverbial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-14.htm" title="And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.">Zechariah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-11.htm" title="At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,">Jeremiah 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-24.htm" title="Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.">Jeremiah 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm" title="Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So it cometh.</span>--The absence of a subject to the verb gives the opening words a terrible vagueness. Something is coming "from the wilderness, a terrible land," beyond it. The "wilderness" in this case is clearly the Arabian desert, through part of which the Euphrates flows. The context determines the "terrible land" as that of Elam and Media.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - THE BURDEN OF THE DESERT OF THE SEA. This is a short and somewhat vague, but highly poetic, "burden of Babylon" It is probably an earlier prophecy than <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. and 14, and perhaps the first revelation made to Isaiah with respect to the fall of the great Chaldean capital. It exhibits no consciousness of the fact that Babylon is Judah's predestined destroyer, and is expressive rather of sympathy (vers. 3, 4) than of triumph. Among recent critics, some suppose it to refer to Sargon's capture of the city in <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>; but the objection to this view, from the entire absence of all reference to Assyria as the conquering power, and the mention of "Elam" and "Media" in her place, is absolutely fatal to it. There can be no reasonable doubt that the same siege is intended as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, where also Media is mentioned (ver. 17); and there are no real grounds for questioning that the event of which the prophet is made cognizant is that siege and capture of Babylon by Cyrus the Great which destroyed the Babylonian empire. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The desert of the sea</span>. The Isaianic authorship of this title is doubtful, since "the desert of the sea" is an expression elsewhere wholly unknown to biblical writers. Some regard "the sea" as the Euphrates, in which case "the desert of the sea" may be the waste tract west of the Euphrates, extending thence to the eastern borders of Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">As whirlwinds in the south pass through</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as whirlwinds in the south country</span>, <span class="accented">sweeping along</span>. The "south country" is that immediately to the south of Judaea. Its liability to whirlwinds is noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a> (compare Major Palmer's 'Sinai,' p. 33). <span class="cmt_word">It cometh</span>. What cometh? Dr. Kay says, "God's visitation;" Rosenm&uuml;ller, "a numerous army." But is it not rather the "grievous vision" of the next verse? <span class="cmt_word">From the desert.</span> The <span class="accented">great</span> desert bounding Palestine on the east - a truly "terrible land." Across this, as coming from Baby-Ionia to Palestine, seemed to rush the vision which it was given to the prophet to see. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 Babylon was a flat country, abundantly watered. The destruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typical of the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church, foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let this check vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in what heaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, when forced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medes and Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, that they shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor; hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In all events concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must look to God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to do every thing that is for her good.</body></html>
