The land of which he is about to speak is a land of shadow and of gloom. Evening is falling on it. It is a question whether the second Arabia is to retain its geographical form or to be translated "evening," as before. In any case, of course, Arabia is the country spoken of. The "Dedanites" appear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm" title="Flee you, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I will visit him.">Jeremiah 49:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-13.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.">Ezekiel 25:13</a>, and seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.">Ezekiel 27:15</a> to have been dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm" title="Flee you, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I will visit him.">Jeremiah 49:8</a>) as a commercial people trading with Tyre in ebony and ivory. The point of the oracle against them is that they shall be compelled by the presence of the Assyrian armies to leave the main lines of their traffic, probably, as before, on their way westward to Tyre, and to take bye-paths, pitching their tents not near towns and villages, but in the low brushwood of the wilderness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-17.</span> - THE BURDEN OF ARABIA. Edom will have companions in misfortune among the Arab tribes upon her borders, Dedan, Tema, and Kedar. War will enter their territory, derange their commerce (ver. 13), cause flight and privation (vers. 14, 15), and within a year greatly diminish the number of their fighting men (vers. 16, 17). The date of the prophecy is uncertain, but can scarcely be earlier than <span class="date">B.C. 715</span>, when Sargon made an expedition into Arabia (O. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 66). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The burden upon Arabia</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in Arabia</span>. The phrase is varied from its usual form, probably because it is not Arabia generally, but only certain of the more northern tribes, on whom calamity is about to fall. <span class="cmt_word">In the forest... shall ye lodge</span>. The word used is commonly translated "forest;" but Arabia has no forests, and the meaning here must be "brushwood." Thorny bushes and shrubs are common in all parts of Arabia. The general meaning is that the caravans will have to leave the beaten track, and obtain such shelter and concealment as the scanty brushwood of the desert could afford. <span class="cmt_word">Ye traveling companies of Dedanim.</span> The Dedanim, or Dedanites, were among the chief traders of the Arabian peninsula. They had commercial dealings with Tyre, which they supplied with ivory, ebony, and "precious clothes for chariots" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15, 20</a>). This trade they carried on by means of large caravans - the "travelling companies" of the present passage. They are thought to have had their chief <span class="accented">settlements</span> on the shores of the Persian Gulf, where the island of Dadan may be an echo of their name. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:13-17 The Arabians lived in tents, and kept cattle. A destroying army shall be brought upon them, and make them an easy prey. We know not what straits we may be brought into before we die. Those may know the want of necessary food who now eat bread to the full. Neither the skill of archers, nor the courage of mighty men, can protect from the judgments of God. That is poor glory, which will thus quickly come to nothing. Thus hath the Lord said to me; and no word of his shall fall to the ground. We may be sure the Strength of Israel will not lie. Happy are those only whose riches and glory are out of the reach of invaders; all other prosperity will speedily pass away.</body></html>
