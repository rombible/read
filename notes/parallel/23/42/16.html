"The blind" here can only be captive Israel, still dim-sighted from the effect of its old sins against light, and therefore greatly needing God's guidance. God promises to "bring them" out of captivity "by a way not hitherto known to them" - the way of voluntary release by the favour of a new king (see the comment on ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">I will make darkness light before them</span>; either, <span class="accented">I will illuminate with rays of light and hope the dark and cheerless life that they have been leading</span> (Delitzsch), or, I <span class="accented">will throw light upon that dark future which has hitherto stretched before them</span>, <span class="accented">and allow them to penetrate its obscurity</span>, <span class="accented">and see what is about to happen. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Crooked things</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rough places</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> difficulties of any and every kind.

Dr. Kay translates, "These things <span class="accented">have I done</span>, and <span class="accented">have n</span>o<span class="accented">t forsaken</span> them;" Mr. Cheyne, "These are the things that I will do, and will not let them slip;" Delitzsch, "These are the things that I carry out and do not leave." According to the two latter renderings, the clause is a mere solemn confirmation of the previous promises. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:13-17 The Lord will appear in his power and glory. He shall cry, in the preaching of his word. He shall cry aloud in the gospel woes, which must be preached with gospel blessings, to awaken a sleeping world. He shall conquer by the power of his Spirit. And those that contradict and blaspheme his gospel, he shall put to silence and shame; and that which hinders its progress shall be taken out of the way. To those who by nature were blind, God will show the way to life and happiness by Jesus Christ. They are weak in knowledge, but He will make darkness light. They are weak in duty, but their way shall be plain. Those whom God brings into the right way, he will guide in it. This passage is a prophecy, and is also applicable to every believer; for the Lord will never leave nor forsake them.</body></html>
