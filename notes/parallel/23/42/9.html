Jehovah is still the speaker. He begins by promising a new revelation (ver. 9). Then, before the revelation is made, he calls upon the nations - especially those in the vicinity of Palestine - to rejoice at what is about to happen (vers. 10-12). After this he proceeds to make the announcement promised in ver. 9 - an announcement that he is about to deliver his people (ver. 16) and to execute vengeance on their enemies (vers. 13-15 and 17). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the former things are come to pass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> former prophecies have been fulfilled. Israel has been led lute captivity, and in her captivity has suffered grievous things.

The voluntary restoration of a captive people to their own land by the power to which they were subject, and which could compel their services, was emphatically a "new thing" in the world's history. How unwilling the sovereign power was ordinarily to lose such services may be seen by the narrative in Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5-14</a>.), and again by the account which Herodotus gives (1:73, 74) of the ground of quarrel between Alyattes and Cyaxares. <span class="cmt_word">Before they spring forth</span>; or, <span class="accented">shoot forth.</span> The metaphor is one taken from the vegetable world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:5-12 The work of redemption brings back man to the obedience he owes to God as his Maker. Christ is the light of the world. And by his grace he opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets at liberty from the bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. And now he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them and by them. Let us give to God those things which are his, taking heed that we do not serve the creature more than the Creator.</body></html>
