The exhortation to "sing unto the Lord a new song" ends with ver. 12, and now the reason or groundwork for the exhortation has to be declared. God is about to make one of the great manifestations of his power upon the earth - to "<span class="accented">go</span> forth" against his enemies, and destroy and devour, and easily prevail against them - not, however, simply in the way of punishment and vengeance, but with a further merciful object. He will punish Babylon, that he may deliver Israel. He has promised not to forsake his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>). He is now about to give effect to his promise by a "new" and strange deliverance. He "will bring his people by a way that they knew not, and lead them in paths that they have not known" (ver. 16). It has been said that "in effect it is the day of judgment which is here described" (Cheyne); but this seems to be only so far true as every manifestation of God's wrath towards his enemies is a foreshadowing of the great and awful day. The event directly in view is the destruction of the Babylonian power by the irresistible arms of Cyrus. Hence the allusion to idolaters and images in ver. 17. <span class="cmt_word">As a mighty man... like a man of war</span>. (For similar anthropomorpbisms, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He shall stir up jealousy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his own jealousy. God is "a jealous God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), so much SO that his very "name is Jealous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). He is jealous for his own honour (<span class="accented">supra</span>, ver. 8), and jealous also for his people's honour and reputation and happiness. Occasionally he allows his jealousy to slumber (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>:30, "The times of this ignorance God winked at"); and this he had now done for some fifty or sixty years, since his people were carried into captivity. But the time of acquiescence has gone by - he is about to waken up his "smouldering jealousy, and stir it, till it burns up into a bright flame" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">He shall cry, yea, roar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">yea</span>, <span class="accented">shout</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> utter his battle-cry with a clear, loud voice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:13-17 The Lord will appear in his power and glory. He shall cry, in the preaching of his word. He shall cry aloud in the gospel woes, which must be preached with gospel blessings, to awaken a sleeping world. He shall conquer by the power of his Spirit. And those that contradict and blaspheme his gospel, he shall put to silence and shame; and that which hinders its progress shall be taken out of the way. To those who by nature were blind, God will show the way to life and happiness by Jesus Christ. They are weak in knowledge, but He will make darkness light. They are weak in duty, but their way shall be plain. Those whom God brings into the right way, he will guide in it. This passage is a prophecy, and is also applicable to every believer; for the Lord will never leave nor forsake them.</body></html>
