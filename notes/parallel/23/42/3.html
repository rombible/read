The simple negative "he shall not break" implies, as in the rhetoric of all times, the opposite extreme, the tender care that props and supports. The humanity of the servant of the Lord was to embody what had been already predicated of the Divine will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-17.htm" title="The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.">Psalm 51:17</a>). The <span class= "ital">dimly burning flax, </span>the wick of a lamp nearly out, He will foster and cherish and feed the spiritual life, all but extinguished, with oil till it burns brightly again.

Egypt was compared to a "bruised reed" by Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>), as being untrustworthy and destitute of physical strength; but here the image represents the weak and depressed in spirit, the lowly and dejected. Christ would deal tenderly with such, not violently. <span class="cmt_word">Smoking flax shall he not quench</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the wick which burns dimly</span> (margin) <span class="accented">he shall not quench.</span> Where the flame of devotion burns at all, however feebly and dimly, Messiah will take care not to quench it. Rather he will tend it, and trim it, and give it fresh oil, and cause it to burn more brightly. <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring forth judgment unto truth</span>. But with all this tenderness, this "economy," this allowance for the shortcomings and <span class="accented">weaknesses</span> of individuals, he will be uncompromising in his assertion of absolute justice and absolute truth. He will sanction nothing short of the very highest standard of moral purity and excellence. (For an instance of the combination of extreme tenderness with unswerving maintenance of an absolute standard, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-8.htm">John 8:8-11</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-4 This prophecy was fulfilled in Christ, Mt 12:17. Let our souls rely on him, and rejoice in him; then, for his sake, the Father will be well-pleased with us. The Holy Spirit not only came, but rested upon him, and without measure. He patiently bore the contradiction of sinners. His kingdom is spiritual; he was not to appear with earthly honours. He is tender of those oppressed with doubts and fears, as a bruised reed; those who are as smoking flax, as the wick of a lamp newly lighted, which is ready to go out again. He will not despise them, nor lay upon them more work or more suffering than they can bear. By a long course of miracles and his resurrection, he fully showed the truth of his holy religion. By the power of his gospel and grace he fixes principles in the minds of men, which tend to make them wise and just. The most distant nations wait for his law, wait for his gospel, and shall welcome it. If we would make our calling and election sure, and have the Father delight over us for good, we must behold, hear, believe in, and obey Christ.</body></html>
