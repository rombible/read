play skillfully with a loud noise.">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-3.htm" title="And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.">Psalm 40:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-1.htm" title="O sing to the LORD a new song; for he has done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, has gotten him the victory.">Psalm 98:1</a>) and are probably quoted from them. The only touch of definite localisation is found in the mention of Kedar. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm" title="For thus has the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:">Isaiah 21:16</a>.) Starting from this, the other terms gain a more defined significance. The proclamation seems to be addressed to the nations of the Eastern, not the Western world, as if to the ships that sailed from Elath or Ezion-geber down the Elanitic Gulf. The rock, or Sela (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm" title="Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.">Isaiah 16:1</a>), is the Petra of Roman Idumaea; the ships are those that trade to Ophir or the land of Sinim. The cities and the nomad tribes are all invited to join in the hymn of praise, and it is to be echoed in the far-off "islands," or <span class= "ital">coasts, </span>of the Indian Ocean.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto the Lord a new song</span>. The call for a "new song" is based upon the ground that the mercy vouchsafed was a "new" one (see ver. 9). The expression is frequent in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His praise from the end of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let his praise be sung by all the inhabitants of the earth to its remotest bounds." <span class="cmt_word">The sea</span>. Sea and land are called upon equally to proclaim God's praise; the sea, "and its fulness" (margin) - those who frequent it in ships, and those who dwell on its shores and islands. The last clause, "the isles and the inhabitants thereof," is exegetical of the preceding one - " all that is therein." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:5-12 The work of redemption brings back man to the obedience he owes to God as his Maker. Christ is the light of the world. And by his grace he opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets at liberty from the bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. And now he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them and by them. Let us give to God those things which are his, taking heed that we do not serve the creature more than the Creator.</body></html>
