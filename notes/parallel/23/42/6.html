His call was in accordance with the absolute righteousness of God, manifesting itself in love.<p><span class= "bld">A covenant of the people.</span>--The context limits the "people" to Israel. The "servant of the Lord" is to be in Himself not only the mediator of the covenant, but <span class= "ital">the </span>covenant, the meeting-point between God and man, just as He is the "peace" as well as the peacemaker (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm" title="And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.">Micah 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>). The words may well have furnished a starting-point for the "new covenant" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, and the whole series of thoughts that have grown out of it.<p><span class= "bld">A light of the Gentiles.</span>--Re-echoed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-32.htm" title="A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.">Luke 2:32</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I the Lord have called thee in righteousness</span>. The "Servant of Jehovah" is addressed. God has "called" him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> appointed him to his mediatorial office "<span class="accented">in righteousness</span>," in accordance with the righteous purpose which he has entertained towards his fallen creatures from the beginning of the world. <span class="cmt_word">And will give thee for a Covenant of the people</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). The covenant between God and his people being in Christ, it is quite consistent with Hebrew usage to transfer the term to Christ himself, in whom the covenant was, as it were, embodied. So Christ is called "<span class="accented">our</span> Salvation" and "our <span class="accented">Peace</span>," and again, "our Redemption" and "our Life." This is the ordinary tone of Hebrew poetry, which rejoices in personification and embodiment. A prose writer would have said that the Servant of the Lord would be given as the Mediator of a covenant between Jehovah and his people. <span class="cmt_word">For a light of the Gentiles</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-4.htm">Isaiah 51:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:5-12 The work of redemption brings back man to the obedience he owes to God as his Maker. Christ is the light of the world. And by his grace he opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets at liberty from the bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. And now he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them and by them. Let us give to God those things which are his, taking heed that we do not serve the creature more than the Creator.</body></html>
