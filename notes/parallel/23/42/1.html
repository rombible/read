"Elect" is another of the words with which Isaiah has fashioned the theology of Christendom. It meets us there four times (45:4, 65:9, 22), and is echoed and interpreted in the voice from heaven of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>. That voice fixed on the human consciousness of the Son of Man that He was "<span class= "ital">the </span>servant of the Lord," and throughout His life we trace an ever expanding and conscious reproduction of the chief features of Isaiah's picture. Disciples like St. Matthew learnt to recognise that likeness even in what might seem to us subordinate details (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,">Matthew 12:17-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I have put my spirit . . .</span>--An echo from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>, heard once more in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a>. The promise we note as fulfilled in closest connection with the utterance of the previous words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm" title="And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove on him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.">Luke 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.">John 1:32-33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He shall bring forth judgment to . . .</span>--The ministry of "<span class= "ital">the </span>servant," as extending to the Gentiles, is prominent in 2 Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-15.htm" title="So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.">Isaiah 52:15</a>). It expands the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1-4</a><span class= "ital">. </span>There the Temple is the centre from which the knowledge and the "judgment" (used here in the sense of <span class= "ital">law, </span>or <span class= "ital">ordinance</span>) flow; here it is from the personal teaching of "<span class= "ital">the </span>servant."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, AND THE WORK WHICH HE WILL PERFORM. There are comparatively few who deny that, in this place at any rate, the "Servant of the Lord" is the Messiah. (So the Targum on the passage; so Abar-barnel; so, among moderns, Oehler, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne.) The portraiture has "so strong an individuality and such marked personal features, that it cannot possibly be a mere personified collective;" and it goes so "infinitely <span class="accented">beyond</span> anything of which a man was ever capable that it can only be the future Christ" (Delitzsch). It may be added that St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-17.htm">Matthew 12:17-21</a>) distinctly applies the passage to our Lord. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>. "Behold," as Mr. Cheyne says, "invites the attention of the world - both of the Jews and of the nations - to a new revelation." It looks back to the similar expression of vers. 24 and 29 of the preceding chapter, which draw down the curtain upon the idol-gods, while this "behold" reveals One who is to occupy their place, and to be a worthy object of the worship of mankind, <span class="cmt_word">My Servant</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my true and perfect servant, utterly obedient (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2</a>); not, like Israel, my rebellious and faithless servant; not, even, like my prophets, yielding an imperfect obedience, <span class="cmt_word">Whom I uphold</span>. "As the Father hath life in himself, so <span class="accented">hath he given</span> to the Son to have life in himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). As the fount or origin of Divinity (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), the Father supports and sustains even the Son and the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">Mine Elect</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>). Christ was "chosen" from all eternity in God's counsels to the great work of man's redemption, and to be the Mediator between God and man. <span class="cmt_word">I have put my Spirit upon him</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; and for the fulfilment, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-34.htm">Luke 3:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "he shall publish," or "cause to be published, to the Gentiles, the true Law of God - religion on its practical side." The publication of Christianity throughout all the world has abundantly fulfilled this promise or prophecy. The call of the Gentiles had been already declared by Isaiah in his earlier preaching (ch. 2:2; 11:10; 19:22-25; 25:6; 27:13, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:1-4 This prophecy was fulfilled in Christ, Mt 12:17. Let our souls rely on him, and rejoice in him; then, for his sake, the Father will be well-pleased with us. The Holy Spirit not only came, but rested upon him, and without measure. He patiently bore the contradiction of sinners. His kingdom is spiritual; he was not to appear with earthly honours. He is tender of those oppressed with doubts and fears, as a bruised reed; those who are as smoking flax, as the wick of a lamp newly lighted, which is ready to go out again. He will not despise them, nor lay upon them more work or more suffering than they can bear. By a long course of miracles and his resurrection, he fully showed the truth of his holy religion. By the power of his gospel and grace he fixes principles in the minds of men, which tend to make them wise and just. The most distant nations wait for his law, wait for his gospel, and shall welcome it. If we would make our calling and election sure, and have the Father delight over us for good, we must behold, hear, believe in, and obey Christ.</body></html>
