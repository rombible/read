"Long time," literally, <span class= "ital">for an age, </span>or <span class= "ital">an eternity. </span>What is actually meant is the period of the exile, during which, till the advent of the deliverer, there had been no interposition on behalf of Israel. To the exiles this had seemed endless in its weariness. Now there were the travail-pangs of a new birth for the nation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-8.htm" title="All these are the beginning of sorrows.">Matthew 24:8</a>.) Was it strange that there should be the convulsions and catastrophes which are as the thunder-roaring of the voice of Jehovah?<p><span class= "bld">I will destroy and devour.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I pant and gasp. </span>The verbs express strong emotion, the cries of the travailing woman rather than destructive acts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have long time holden my peace</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for an eternity.</span> God's love for his people is forcibly expressed by his saying that he has felt it "an eternity" - though it was but some five or six decades - while he was waiting for his chastisement to have such due effect as would allow of his bringing it to an end, and showing them mercy. He has chafed, as it were, under the necessity of inaction, and has with difficulty refrained himself. Now he will refrain no longer. <span class="cmt_word">A travailing woman</span>. A woman in her travail, after long endurance, at last gives free vent to her natural feelings, and utters loud cries (compare the preceding verse). I will destroy and devour at once (so Gesenius, Kay, and the ancient versions). But the bulk of modern commentators render, "I will pant and gasp," as does a travailing woman. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:13-17 The Lord will appear in his power and glory. He shall cry, in the preaching of his word. He shall cry aloud in the gospel woes, which must be preached with gospel blessings, to awaken a sleeping world. He shall conquer by the power of his Spirit. And those that contradict and blaspheme his gospel, he shall put to silence and shame; and that which hinders its progress shall be taken out of the way. To those who by nature were blind, God will show the way to life and happiness by Jesus Christ. They are weak in knowledge, but He will make darkness light. They are weak in duty, but their way shall be plain. Those whom God brings into the right way, he will guide in it. This passage is a prophecy, and is also applicable to every believer; for the Lord will never leave nor forsake them.</body></html>
