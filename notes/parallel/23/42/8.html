It follows from that meaning that God cannot look with indifference on the transfer to the "graven image" of the worship due to Him. With his vision of Cyrus still present to his thoughts, the prophet again presses the unique point of prediction as distinguishing the religion of Israel from that of the heathen. The "former things" refer probably not to the remote past, but to Isaiah's earlier prophecies, say the whole Assyrian cycle, on which he now looks back from his new stand-point; or even, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-22.htm" title="Let them bring them forth, and show us what shall happen: let them show the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.">Isaiah 41:22</a>, to the near future of the conquests of Cyrus as compared with that which was to usher in the restoration of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">the Lord.</span> The sense runs on from the preceding verses: "<span class="accented">I</span>, the Lord, will do all this, I who am all that the Name" Jehovah' signifies - self-existent, eternal, self-sufficing, independent, omnipotent, and therefore unique, one whose glory cannot be shared with any other being that <span class="accented">exists - least</span> of all with images, which are mere vanity and nothingness." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:5-12 The work of redemption brings back man to the obedience he owes to God as his Maker.

And now he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them and by them. Let us give to God those things which are his, taking heed that we do not serve the creature more than the Creator.</body></html>
