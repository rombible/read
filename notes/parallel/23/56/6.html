The words "to serve him" have been referred to some menial offices like that of the Nethinim, "hewers of wood and drawers of water" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm" title="And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.">Joshua 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-20.htm" title="Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.">Ezra 8:20</a>). The usage of the word, however, limits it to honourable functions. The germ of Isaiah's thought appears in Solomon's dedication prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-41.htm" title="Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name's sake;">1Kings 8:41-43</a>).

The proselytes shall not be treated as they fear. On the contrary, God will treat them in exactly the same way as his original people - will conduct them to Palestine, settle them in his "holy mountain," admit them to the temple services, accept their burnt offerings and their sacrifices. All this will be a foretaste of their position in the Christian Church, where there will be neither Jew nor Gentile, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, but a community where all are brethren and all have equal privileges. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/56.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>56:3-8 Unbelief often suggests things to discourage believers, against which God has expressly guarded. Spiritual blessings are unspeakably better than having sons and daughters; for children are a care, and may prove a grief and shame, but the blessings we partake of in God's house, are comforts which cannot be made bitter. Those who love the Lord truly, will serve him faithfully, and then his commandments are not grievous. Three things are promised. Assistance: I will not only bid them welcome, but incline them to come. Acceptance, and comfort: though they came mourning to the house of prayer, they shall go away rejoicing. They shall find ease by casting their cares and burdens upon God. Many a sorrowful spirit has been made joyful in the house of prayer. The Gentiles shall be one body with the Jews, that, as Christ says, Joh 10:16, there may be one fold and one Shepherd. Thanks be to God that none are separated from him except by wilful sin and unbelief; and if we come to him, we shall be accepted through the sacrifice of our great High Priest.</body></html>
