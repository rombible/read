they cannot understand. </span>There is no confusion or change of metaphors. What is implied is that the prophets who are not fit to be watch-dogs of the flock, assume the office of its shepherds.<p><span class= "bld">From his quarter</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in modern phrase, from his own sphere of influence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they are greedy dogs</span>. Another defect is noted. Not only do they fail in the way of neglect of duty, but they are actively culpable. Being worldly and not spiritually minded, they are "greedy" after gain. Anciently, the taking of a gift, or fee, from those who came to consult them was regarded as no dishonour to the prophetic office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>); but the nobler class of prophets declined to make a profit of their spiritual powers, and would receive no fee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20</a>). In Ezekiel and Micah the taking of gifts by prophets is regarded as discreditable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>). From his quarter; rather, <span class="accented">to the uttermost</span> (Kay), or <span class="accented">every one</span>, <span class="accented">without exception</span> (Cheyne). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/56.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>56:9-12 Desolating judgments are called for; and this severe rebuke of the rulers and teachers of the Jewish church, is applicable to other ages and places. It is bad with a people when their shepherds slumber, and are eager after the world. Let us pray the Great Shepherd to send us pastors after his own heart, who will feed us with knowledge, that we may rejoice in his holy name, and that believers may be daily added to the church.</body></html>
