The "lying down" contrasts their indolent and easy life with the vigil and the fast of a true prophet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His watchmen are blind</span>. Israel's "watchmen" are his guides and teachers, the prophets (Isaiah 6:17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, etc.). At the time of which Isaiah speaks, they are "blind" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7, 16, 18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>, etc.), or without knowledge - like the "blind guides" of the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-39.htm">Luke 6:39</a>, etc.). They have not the spiritual discernment which would enable them to lead the people aright. <span class="cmt_word">Further, they are dumb dogs.</span> Instead of acting as faithful watch-dogs, who give warning of the approach of danger by their barking, they remain apathetic, and utter no warning at all. It is as if they passed their lives in sleep. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/56.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>56:9-12 Desolating judgments are called for; and this severe rebuke of the rulers and teachers of the Jewish church, is applicable to other ages and places. It is bad with a people when their shepherds slumber, and are eager after the world. Let us pray the Great Shepherd to send us pastors after his own heart, who will feed us with knowledge, that we may rejoice in his holy name, and that believers may be daily added to the church.</body></html>
