It has been said (Cheyne, following many other critics) that "the writer of this section presupposes the circumstances of a period long subsequent to the reign of Hessekiah." It will be seen in the following notes that I cannot altogether accept that statement, and find circumstances in the closing years of Isaiah's life which may well have given occasion to his teaching here. It obviously does not stand in any close connection with the preceding chapter.<p><span class= "bld">Keep ye judgment</span>--i.e., the righteousness of the law. The general exhortation is specialised in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - AN EXHORTATION TO OBSERVE THE LAW, ESPECIALLY THE LAW OF THE SABBATH, COMBINED WITH PROMISES. There was much of the Law which it was impossible to observe during the Captivity. Sacrifice had ceased, the temple was destroyed, almost all the ceremonial law must have been suspended; even the command to do no work on the sabbath day cannot have been kept by a nation of slaves, whose masters would certainly not have permitted them to be idle one day in seven. Still, the spirit of the ordinance might be kept by devoting the day, so far as was possible, to religious observance, as to prayer and to meditation upon holy things. This is now enjoined on the captive Jews, with the promise of a blessing - a blessing in which even the most despised part of the nation, the proselytes and the eunuchs, might participate. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep ye judgment, and do justice;</span> rather, <span class="accented">keep ye Law</span>, <span class="accented">and observe righteousness.</span> The exhortation is general, and has no special bearing on trials or law-courts. It is a call on the Jews, in their captivity, to keep, so far as was possible, the whole Law given on Sinai. My salvation is near to come. The nearer the time of deliverance approaches, the more faithful and exact ought Israel to be in life and conduct. God's "salvation" and his "righteousness" go hand-in-hand. It is as his righteous people, "a holy seed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>), that he is about to vindicate and rescue them. If they are no holier than others, why should he do more for them than for those others? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/56.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>56:1,2 The Lord tells us what are his expectations of duty from us. Be honest and just in all dealings. Also strictly observe the sabbath day. To have the blessing of God upon employments all the week, make conscience of keeping the sabbath holy. Have nothing to do with sin. Blessed is the man that keeps his hand from all things displeasing to God and hurtful to his own soul. Those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith, will be found walking in ways of holy obedience.</body></html>
