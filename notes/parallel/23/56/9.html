The contents of that section fit in with the assumption of its having been written early in the reign of Manasseh, better than With that of a date after the exile. The opening words summon the enemies of Israel to do their work of punishment, and this is followed naturally by a denunciation of the sins which had made it necessary. For the form of the summons, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm" title="As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;">Ezekiel 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-9.htm" title="My heritage is to me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come you, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.">Jeremiah 12:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - THE BLIND GUIDES OF ISRAEL REBUKED. A sudden change of style marks the introduction of an entirely new prophecy. The eye of the prophet, apparently, goes back from the period of the exile, which he has been so long contemplating, to his own day, or at any rate to the pre-exile period, and rests upon Israel in their own land. He sees them misled by their teachers (vers. 10-12), given to idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-3.htm">Isaiah 57:3-9</a>), and offering themselves a ready prey to their enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>). Many modern critics regard the passage as the composition of an unknown prophet belonging to the time of Manasseh. But there is no sufficient evidence of this. The prophecy has many Isaiah characteristics. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beasts of the field... beasts in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the forest;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all wild beasts of whatever kind" - all the enemies of God's flock (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Come to devour.</span> Make haste, now is your opportunity.
