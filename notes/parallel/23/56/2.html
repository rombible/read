It is almost certain that the counsellors of the young Manasseh (probably the Shebna party), abandoning the religion of Israel in other things, would also disregard this. I take the prophet's teaching accordingly as directed against that evil. He utters his beatitude for those who are faithful to the <span class= "ital">regime </span>of Hezekiah's reign, even though their alien birth or their condition as eunuchs seemed to exclude them from the polity of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1-8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That doeth this... that layeth hold on it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that doeth according to the exhortation in ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">That keepeth the sabbath</span>. The prominent place assigned to this duty by the evangelical prophet is remarkable. We may observe, however, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the spirit of obedience is better tested by a positive than by a moral ordinance; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that as, probably, there could be little outward keeping of the sabbath by the captives, it would have had to be kept inwardly by spiritual exercises, by silent prayer and praise, together with prolonged meditation upon holy things. In the absence of all the ordinary aids to devotion, the religious condition of the people must have depended very much on their keeping up the recollection of the sabbath, and hallowing it so far as was possible; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> doing no work for themselves, neither buying nor selling, making their devotions longer, and keeping God in their thoughts throughout the day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/56.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>56:1,2 The Lord tells us what are his expectations of duty from us. Be honest and just in all dealings. Also strictly observe the sabbath day. To have the blessing of God upon employments all the week, make conscience of keeping the sabbath holy. Have nothing to do with sin. Blessed is the man that keeps his hand from all things displeasing to God and hurtful to his own soul. Those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith, will be found walking in ways of holy obedience.</body></html>
