Each view has the support of commentators. The last seems beyond question most in harmony with the context. Ineffective struggles for preservation naturally suggest the parallel, "like some strong swimmer in his agony" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/69-1.htm" title="Save me, O God; for the waters are come in to my soul.">Psalm 69:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm" title="Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.">Psalm 69:14</a>). In the second clause there is, of course, no reason for doubt. It is Jehovah who "brings down the pride" of the guilty nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall spread forth his hands... as he that swimmeth</span>.

A continued plotting of the enemies of God against his Church seems to be assumed, even after the Church is established in the spiritual Zion under the direct protection and rule of Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:9-12 With joy and praise will those entertain the glad tidings of the Redeemer, who looked for him; and with a triumphant song will glorified saints enter into the joy of their Lord. And it is not in vain to wait for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundant recompence for the delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross, to make way for our salvation, will at length be stretched forth to destroy all impenitent sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries of God's people; they shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shall bring down the pride of the enemies by one humbling judgment after another. This destruction of Moab is typical of Christ's victory, and the pulling down of Satan's strong holds. Therefore, beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
