The inscription of the Moabite stone, in connection with Isaiah 15, helps to explain the nature of the allusion. Moab had been prominent among the enemies of Israel; the claims of Chemosh, the god of Moab, had been set up against those of Jehovah, the God of Israel (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>xi. 166), and so the name had become representative of His enemies. There was a mystical Moab, as there was afterwards a mystical Babylon, and in Rabbinic writings a mystical Edom (i.e., Rome). The proud nation was to lie wallowing in the mire of shame, trampled on by its s on the threshing-floor is trampled by the oxen till it looks like a heap of dung. In the Hebrew word for "dunghill" (<span class= "ital">madm?nah</span>) we may probably trace a reference to the Moabite city of that name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm" title="There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), in which Isaiah sees an unconscious prophecy of the future condition of the whole nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest</span>.

Various reasons have been given for the selection of Moab to represent the enemies of the redeemed. Perhaps, as the Moabites were, on the whole, the bitterest of all the adversaries of the Jews (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>), they are regarded as the fittest representatives of the human adversaries of God. <span class="cmt_word">For the dung-hill</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the water of a dung-pit</span>. The image is, perhaps, selected with conscious reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, where the psalmist prays that the "children of Lot" and their helpers may become "as the dung of the earth" (ver. 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:9-12 With joy and praise will those entertain the glad tidings of the Redeemer, who looked for him; and with a triumphant song will glorified saints enter into the joy of their Lord. And it is not in vain to wait for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundant recompence for the delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross, to make way for our salvation, will at length be stretched forth to destroy all impenitent sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries of God's people; they shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shall bring down the pride of the enemies by one humbling judgment after another. This destruction of Moab is typical of Christ's victory, and the pulling down of Satan's strong holds. Therefore, beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
