From that storm the faithful servants of the Lord should find shelter as in the castle of the great King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The poor... the needy.</span> The "poor and needy" are especially the afflicted saints, whom the ungodly of the earth have so long injured and oppressed. God is ever a "Strength" and "Refuge" to such (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A Refuge from the storm</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>; and the Psalms <span class="accented">passim</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>A Shadow from the heat</span>. The idea is a little enlarged in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>. Its germ is, perhaps, to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5, 6</a>. No writer accumulates striking images with such force and beauty as Isaiah. Primarily, the entire imagery has reference to what God will have done for his people when the final consummation arrives. Secondarily, a precious encouragement is held out to all who are undergoing their earthly trial and probation, who are taught where to look for a sure refuge in time of trouble. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-5 However this might show the deliverance of the Jews out of captivity, it looked further, to the praises that should be offered up to God for Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies, and the comforts he has provided for all believers. True faith simply credits the Lord's testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises. As God weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthens the weak that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protects his people in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in him from the insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise of strangers; it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, and ever will be, the Refuge of distressed believers. Having provided them a shelter, he teaches them to flee unto it.</body></html>
