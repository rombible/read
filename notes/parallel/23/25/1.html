The absence of a conjunction in the Hebrew, emphasises the enumeration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - ISAIAH'S SONG OF PRAISE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOD'S KINGDOM. AS in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>, after describing the first setting up of Christ's kingdom and the call of the Gentiles, the prophet broke out into song, through joy at the tidings he was commissioned to announce, so now, having proclaimed the final establishment of the same kingdom in the heavenly Zion, he is again carried away by the sense of exultant gladness into a fresh <span class="accented">Lobgesang</span>, which he utters in his own person - not, as the former one, in the person of the Church. His song divides itself into three sections: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> vers. 1-5, a thanksgiving for deliverance; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> vers. 6-8, a commemoration of blessings granted; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> vers. 9-12, exultation in the security obtained. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my God; I will exalt thee</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-28.htm">Psalm 118:28</a>). To Isaiah the "Song of Moses" seems to have been a pattern thanksgiving, from which he delighted to draw his phrases when he was bent on formally singing praise to God. Compare the following: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>, "He is become my salvation;" the same with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>, "He is my God; I will exalt him;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>, "Hath dashed in pieces;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a>, "Consumed them as stubble;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-5.htm">Isaiah 46:5</a>, "Who is like," etc.? the same with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>, "Doing wonders;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>, "Fear and dread;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>, "The Lord shall reign." <span class="cmt_word">Wonderful things</span>; <span class="cmt_word">thy counsels of old are</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast wrought wonders</span>, <span class="accented">counsels of old</span>, <span class="accented">faithfulness and truth</span>. The wonders for which God is praised were decreed in his counsels from all eternity; their accomplishment shows forth God's "faithfulness" and "truth." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-5 However this might show the deliverance of the Jews out of captivity, it looked further, to the praises that should be offered up to God for Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies, and the comforts he has provided for all believers. True faith simply credits the Lord's testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises. As God weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthens the weak that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protects his people in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in him from the insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise of strangers; it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, and ever will be, the Refuge of distressed believers. Having provided them a shelter, he teaches them to flee unto it.</body></html>
