Hosea, a contemporary, was inspired to write! "Will ransom Israel from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction" (Hosea 13:14); but otherwise this was the first announcement that death was to disappear and to cease to be a possibility. It was an enormous advance on the dim and vague conceptions of a future life hitherto current (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>) to have such an announcement made as this. Hitherto men had been "through fear of death all their life subject to bondage" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a>). Now they were taught that, in the resurrection-life, there would be no tear, no possibility of death. The joyous outburst of the apostle, when he quotes the present passage (2 Corinthians 15:54), is the natural thanksgiving song of reassured humanity, on recognizing its final deliverance from the unspeakable terror of death and annihilation. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces.</span> A recent commentator asks, "What place is left for tears?" But surely death is not the only cause of human mourning. Our own sins, the sins and sufferings of our dear ones, are the main provocatives of our tears. When it is promised, as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> and Revelation 21:4, that "there shall be no more pain, neither sorrow nor crying," the revelation is made that <span class="accented">there shall be no more</span> sin; for where sin is, sorrow must be. <span class="cmt_word">The rebuke of his people shall he take away</span>. It will be among the lesser satisfactions of the final condition of the saved that they are no longer subject to reproach. In this life they have to endure continually reproach, rebuke, contumely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-10.htm">Psalm 74:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-50.htm">Psalm 89:50, 51</a>, etc.). In the resurrection-life they will be exempt from any such annoyance. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath spoken it</span>. God's word has gone forth. There can be no retractation. The blessings promised are certain to be obtained. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:6-8 The kind reception of repentant sinners, is often in the New Testament likened to a feast. The guests invited are all people, Gentiles as well as Jews. There is that in the gospel which strengthens and makes glad the heart, and is fit for those who are under convictions of sin, and mourning for it. There is a veil spread over all nations, for all sat in darkness. But this veil the Lord will destroy, by the light of his gospel shining in the world, and the power of his Spirit opening men's eyes to receive it. He will raise those to spiritual life who were long dead in trespasses and sins. Christ will himself, in his resurrection, triumph over death. Grief shall be banished; there shall be perfect and endless joy. Those that mourn for sin shall be comforted. Those who suffer for Christ shall have consolations. But in the joys of heaven, and not short of them, will fully be brought to pass this saying, God shall wipe away all tears. The hope of this should now do away over-sorrow, all weeping that hinders sowing. Sometimes, in this world God takes away the reproach of his people from among men; however, it will be done fully at the great day. Let us patiently bear sorrow and shame now; both will be done away shortly.</body></html>
