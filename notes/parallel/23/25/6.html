They are not enumerated; but a certain number are set forth, as specimens from which we may form a conception of the general condition of the "saved." These are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a heavenly feast, in which they will all participate (ver. 6); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a removal of the "veil," or "covering," which is in this life over all things, causing men to have an indistinct vision, and an erroneous estimate of their value; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the abolition of death, which will no longer hang over them as a thing to be feared; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the cessation of tears, or the entire freedom of the saved from all sorrow. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this mountain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heavenly Zion - the "mountain of the Lord's house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto all people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto all peoples</span>. There is no restriction of salvation to any particular race or nation - "Jew, Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), are equally invited, and some of each come in (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). The Church of the redeemed contains men and women of all "nations and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues." <span class="cmt_word">A feast of fat things</span>. It follows from many passages of Holy Scripture that there is something in the final beatitude of man which is best represented to us in our present condition by the image of a "feast" - something very different, no doubt, from the festive joy of which our Teutonic ancestors hoped to partake in the halls of Odin, but yet figured to us most fitly and appropriately by terms ordinarily used to describe earthly feasting. Our Lord tells of a "marriage supper," to which he will invite his friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2-12</a>); and the scene of the "marriage supper of the Lamb, "according to St. John in the Revelation" (Revelation 19:7-9), is heaven. There man, it would seem, will partake of a sacrificial feast with his glorified Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>) - will eat the "heavenly manna," which is "angels' food" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>), and drink a spiritual drink which may be called "the fruit of the vine," deriving from this "eating" and "drinking" life and joy and strength. It has been already observed, in the Commentary upon Exodus (p. 581), that the sacrificial meal on Sinai, whereto the seventy elders were admitted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-11</a>), prefigured this heavenly feasting, and throws a certain light upon it. All gross and carnal ideas must, of course, be subtracted from the conception of the heavenly festivity; but it seems to be true to say that our author, and also St. John and our Lord himself, imply that in the world to come there will be a feast, at which God will be the Host, and all men, priests and laity alike, his guests, and receive from him the choicest and most exquisite gifts - gifts which will make them supremely happy (see Mr. Cheyne's note on the passage, p. 148). <span class="cmt_word">A feast of wines on the lees</span>. 'Wine which remained on its Ices, and was not poured off them into another vessel, was considered to be of especial strength (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>). Its defect was a want of clearness. The wine of the heavenly banquet is to be at once strong and perfectly clear or "well refined." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:6-8 The kind reception of repentant sinners, is often in the New Testament likened to a feast. The guests invited are all people, Gentiles as well as Jews. There is that in the gospel which strengthens and makes glad the heart, and is fit for those who are under convictions of sin, and mourning for it. There is a veil spread over all nations, for all sat in darkness. But this veil the Lord will destroy, by the light of his gospel shining in the world, and the power of his Spirit opening men's eyes to receive it. He will raise those to spiritual life who were long dead in trespasses and sins. Christ will himself, in his resurrection, triumph over death. Grief shall be banished; there shall be perfect and endless joy. Those that mourn for sin shall be comforted. Those who suffer for Christ shall have consolations. But in the joys of heaven, and not short of them, will fully be brought to pass this saying, God shall wipe away all tears. The hope of this should now do away over-sorrow, all weeping that hinders sowing. Sometimes, in this world God takes away the reproach of his people from among men; however, it will be done fully at the great day. Let us patiently bear sorrow and shame now; both will be done away shortly.</body></html>
