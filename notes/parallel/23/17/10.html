They had forsaken the One, and therefore, by a just retribution, the others should be forsaken.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">thou didst plant. </span>The word for "pleasant" is found here only as a common noun. The singular appears as a proper name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-40.htm" title="And the sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the family of the Ardites: and of Naaman, the family of the Naamites.">Numbers 26:40</a>, and in the more familiar instance of <span class= "ital">Naaman the Syrian </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-1.htm" title="Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.">2Kings 5:1</a>). It would appear that the prophet chose the peculiar term to indicate the foreign, in this case the Syrian, character of the worship to which he refers as the "plant" which Israel had adopted. Mr. Cheyne, following an ingenious suggestion of Lagarde's, connects it (1) with the Arabic <span class= "ital">Nahr No'man, </span>the name of the river Belus near Acre, and (2) with the Arabic name (<span class= "ital">Shakaiku-'n-noman</span>) for the red anemone. The former was near the head-quarters of the worship of Thammuz, the Ph?nician Adonis, and the flower was sacred to him, and so it is inferred that the prophet refers to "the gardens of Adonis," fair but perishable (Plato, <span class= "ital">Ph?dr. </span>p. 276 B), in which Israel had delighted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a>). The addition of "strange slips," literally, <span class= "ital">vine-slips of a strange one--</span>i.e., of a strange god (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>)--confirms at least the general drift of this interpretation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast forgotten</span>; rather, because <span class="accented">thou didst forget</span>. The late repentance of a "remnant" which "looked to their Maker" (ver. 7) could not cancel the long catalogue of former sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-8.htm">2 Kings 17:8-17</a>), foremost among which was their rejection of God, or, at any rate, their complete forgetfulness of his claims upon them. <span class="cmt_word">The Rock of thy strength.</span> God is first called "a Rock" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31</a>. The image is caught up by the psalmists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2, 32, 47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1, 2</a>, 31, 46; 19:14; 28:1, etc.), and from them passes to Isaiah (see, besides the present passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; and Isaiah 44:8). Among the later prophets only Habakkuk uses it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>). Israel, instead of looking to this "Rock," had looked to their rock-fortresses (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants</span>; rather, <span class="accented">dost thou plant</span>, or <span class="accented">hast thou planted</span>. Forgetfulness of Jehovah has led to the adoption of a voluptuous religion - one of debased foreign rites. There is possibly, as Mr. Cheyne thinks, a special reference to the cult of Adonis. <span class="cmt_word">Shall set it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">settest it</span>, or <span class="accented">hast set it</span>. "It" must refer to "field" or "garden" understood. The later Israelite religion has been a sort of pleasant garden, planted with exotic slips from various quarters - Phoenicia, Syria, Moab, etc. It has been thought permissible to introduce into it any new cult that took the fancy. Hence the multiplication of altars complained of by Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Sin desolates cities. It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain. See the evil and danger of sin, and its certain consequences.</body></html>
