The altars at Dan and Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>) may be intended, or the Israelites may have had other idolatrous altars besides these (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-11.htm">2 Kings 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a>). Josiah, about <span class="date">B.C. 631</span>, broke down altars throughout all the land of Israel, in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon (?), even unto Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-5.htm">2 Chronicles 34:5-7</a>). Apparently he had the consent of the inhabitants to this demolition. <span class="cmt_word">Either the groves, or the images</span>, <span class="accented">Asherah</span>, the word here and elsewhere commonly translated "grove" in the Authorized Version, is now generally admitted to have designated an artificial construction of wood or metal, which was used in the idolatrous worship of the Phoenicians and the Israelites, probably as the emblem of some deity. The Assyrian "sacred tree" was most likely an emblem of the same kind, and may give an idea of the sort of object worshipped under the name of Asherah (comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 235-237). The Israelites, in the time of their prosperity, had set up "groves" of this character "on every high hill, and under every green tree" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>). Many of them were still standing when Josiah made his iconoclastic raid into the Israelite country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-5.htm">2 Chronicles 34:5-7</a>), and were broken down by him at the same time as the altars. The "images" of this place are the same as those coupled with the Israelite "groves" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-7.htm">2 Chronicles 34:7</a>, namely "sun-images," emblems of Baal, probably pillars or conical stones, such as are known to have held a place in the religious worship of Phoenicia. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Sin desolates cities. It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain. See the evil and danger of sin, and its certain consequences.</body></html>
