In the "rushing of mighty waters" to describe the march of an army we have a parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - A PROPHECY AGAINST ASSYRIA. This passage is, apparently, out of place. At any rate, it is quite unconnected with what precedes, and almost equally so with what follows. Still, it must be borne in mind that, until the destruction of Sennacherib's army, Isaiah has the thought of the Assyrians, as the pressing danger, always before him, and continually reverts to it, often abruptly, and without preparation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-5.htm">Isaiah 8:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-19, 24-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>). The present prophecy seems, more distinctly than any other in the purely prophetical chapters, to point to the miraculous destruction of the hoot which Sennacherib was about to bring against Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the multitude of many people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Ho for the tumult of many peoples!</span> The advance of an army composed of soldiers from many nations is descried. They advance with noise and tumult - a tumult compared with that of "seas that are tumultuous." Under the circumstances of the time, it is reasonable to suppose the Assyrians to be intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6, 7</a>). The rushing sound of the advance is borne in strongly upon the prophet's mind, and made the subject of three consecutive clauses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:12-14 The rage and force of the Assyrians resembled the mighty waters of the sea; but when the God of Israel should rebuke them, they would flee like chaff, or like a rolling thing, before the whirlwind. In the evening Jerusalem would be in trouble, because of the powerful invader, but before morning his army would be nearly cut off. Happy are those who remember God as their salvation, and rely on his power and grace. The trouble of the believers, and the prosperity of their enemies, will be equally short; while the joy of the former, and the destruction of those that hate and spoil them, shall last for ever.</body></html>
