Israel, having united herself with Syria to resist the Assyrians, will incur a similar fate. Her glory will decay, her population dwindle and almost disappear. Still there will be a few left, who, under the circumstances, will turn to God (ver. 7). But it will be too late for anything like a national recovery; the laud will remain "a desolation" on account of the past sins of its inhabitants (vers. 9-11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The glory of Jacob shall be made thin</span>. There is reason to believe that the deportation of the Israelites was gradual. Sargon, on taking Samaria for the first time, in <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, carried off no more than 27, 290 of the inhabitants (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 125). Over the remainder he appointed governors, and required them to pay the same taxation as before. About <span class="date">B.C. 715</span> he placed a number of Arabs in Samaria, probably deporting natives to make room for them (ibid., p. 128). The continuant of a remnant of Israelites in the land down to <span class="date">B.C. 625</span> is indicated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The fatness of his flesh shall wax lean</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>). Depopulation is primarily intended; but there is, perhaps, also a more general reference to depression, wasting, and misery. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Sin desolates cities. It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain. See the evil and danger of sin, and its certain consequences.</body></html>
