In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>, 2 Chron. 28:29, we have a partial fulfilment of that prediction. Writing probably early in the reign of Hezekiah, Isaiah now looks forward to a further fulfilment in the future.<p><span class= "bld">Damascus is taken away from being a city . . .</span>--The words emphasise the result of the Assyrian invasion. The city of ancient days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>) should lose glory and be no more worthy of the name; struck out, as it were, from the list of the great cities of the world.<p><span class= "bld">The cities of Aroer are forsaken.</span>--The LXX. and other versions seem to have followed a different text, and give, "The cities are forsaken for ever." Taking Aroer as the right reading, we note that there were two cities of the name, one in the tribe of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm" title="From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm" title="And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>), afterwards in the possession of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-19.htm" title="O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that flees, and her that escapes, and say, What is done?">Jeremiah 48:19</a>), and the other in that of Gad, near Rabbah of Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm" title="And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;">Joshua 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm" title="And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the middle of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:">2Samuel 24:5</a>). The present passage seems to imply a closer connection with Damascus. and therefore a more northern position than that of either of these cities. The latter of the two Just named may, however, have been in alliance with Damascus, and so have shared its fate during the Assyrian invasion. Possibly it may have been chosen for special mention on account of the significance of its name ("laid bare") as ominous of utter ruin. The picture of the "flocks" wandering through the streets of the city reminds us of that of Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim.</span>--The alliance of the two kingdoms is still prominent in Isaiah's thoughts. Both shall fall, he predicts, together; and, with a stern, grave irony, he paints the downfall of "the remnant of Syria." It shall be "as the glory of the children of Israel," i.e., shall be fleeting and transient as that had been proved to be. There is, perhaps, a special reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm" title="As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.">Hosea 9:11</a>, "Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - THE BURDEN OF DAMASCUS. The eye of the prophet travels northwards from Moab, and, passing over Ammon as an enemy of small account, rests once more upon Damascus, already threatened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1 - 9</a>, and probably already partially punished. Damascus is seen once more in alliance with Ephraim (ver. 3), and the two are joined with a new power, Aroer (ver. 2), which possesses several "cities." Woe is denounced on all the three powers: desolation on Damascus and Aroer; on Damascus and Ephraim, the complete loss of the last shadow of independence. The Assyrian inscriptions point out, as the probable date of the prophecy, the commencement of Sargun's reign - about <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> or 721. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Damascus is taken away from being a city</span>. According to Vitringa, Damascus has been destroyed oftener than any other town; but it has a wonderful power of rising again from its ashes. Probably a destruction by Sargon is here intended ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Sin desolates cities. It is strange that great conquerors should take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better that flocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in open rebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who are partakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, by sins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cut down and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for a remnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and there one was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The few that are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledge his hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name. To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is our Maker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. We have reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between us and our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, are expressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practices connected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth of these strange slips, but all in vain. See the evil and danger of sin, and its certain consequences.</body></html>
