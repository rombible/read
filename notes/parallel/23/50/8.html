This was done when God raised up from the dead "the Holy One and the Just" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>). whom cruel men "by wicked hands had crucified and slain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). By the resurrection God acquitted Christ of the charge of blasphemy on which he had been condemned, and proclaimed him "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who will contend with me? </span> (compare St. Paul's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33, 34</a>, "It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?"). God is the sole Judge of all men - of the "Servant" in his human capacity, no less than of others. If he acquits, it is idle for any accuser to stand forth and "contend" or "condemn" (ver. 9). God will help the innocent, whom he has acquitted, and will destroy the accuser by a secret but most sure destruction. The moth shall eat them up (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>, and <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-8.htm">Isaiah 51:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:4-9 As Jesus was God and man in one person, we find him sometimes speaking, or spoken of, as the Lord God; at other times, as man and the servant of Jehovah. He was to declare the truths which comfort the broken, contrite heart, those weary of sin, harassed with afflictions. And as the Holy Spirit was upon him, that he might speak as never man spake; so the same Divine influence daily wakened him to pray, to preach the gospel, and to receive and deliver the whole will of the Father. The Father justified the Son when he accepted the satisfaction he made for the sin of man. Christ speaks in the name of all believers. Who dares to be an enemy to those unto whom he is a Friend? or who will contend with those whom he is an Advocate? Thus St. Paul applies it, Ro 8:33.</body></html>
