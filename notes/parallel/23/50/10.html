All true servants know what it is to feel as if the light for which they looked had for a time failed them, to utter a prayer like that of Ajax, "Give light, and let us die" (Hom. <span class= "ital">Il. </span>xvii. 647). <span class= "ital">The </span>Servant felt it when he uttered the cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>). For such an one there were the words of counsel, "Trust, in spite of the darkness." So the cry of the forsaken Servant was followed by the word "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - AN ADDRESS OF JEHOVAH TO HIS CHURCH. Some suppose that the Church of Hezekiah's reign is addressed; others the exiles towards the close of the Captivity period. The first verse is an exhortation, encouraging those who fear God, but have insufficient light, to trust in him. The second threatens such as "kindle fire," or cause strife, with retribution. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That obeyeth the voice of his servant</span>; that is, of "his servant" for the time being, whether Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or "<span class="accented">the</span> Servant" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="cmt_word">That walketh in darkness</span>. Not clearly seeing his way or knowing what his duty is, and so inclined to despond and doubt. Every such person is bidden to put aside his doubts, and trust <span class="cmt_word">wholly in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God</span>. Hence light will shine in upon him, and his doubts will be resolved, and sufficient light will be granted him to direct his paths. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:10,11 A child of God is afraid of incurring his displeasure. This grace usually appears most in believers when in darkness, when other graces appear not. Those that truly fear God, obey the voice of Christ. A sincere servant of God may for a long time be without views of eternal happiness. What is likely to be an effectual cure in this sad case? Let him trust in the name of the Lord; and let him stay himself upon the promises of the covenant, and build his hopes on them. Let him trust in Christ, trust in that name of his, The Lord our Righteousness; stay himself upon God as his God, in and through a Mediator. Presuming sinners are warned not to trust in themselves. Their own merit and sufficiency are light and heat to them. Creature-comforts are as sparks, short-lived, and soon gone; yet the children of this world, while they last, seek to warm themselves by them, and walk with pride and pleasure in the light of them. Those that make the world their comfort, and their own righteousness their confidence, will certainly meet with bitterness in the end. A godly man's way may be dark, but his end shall be peace and everlasting light. A wicked man's way may be pleasant, but his end and abode for ever will be utter darkness.</body></html>
