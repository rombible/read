The Servant continues his soliloquy. What has come to him in the morning communings with God is, as in the next verse, that he too is to bear reproach and shame, as other disciples had done before him. The writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm" title="All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,">Psalm 22:7</a>, the much-enduring Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm" title="They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.">Job 30:10</a>), the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>), were but foreshadowings of the sufferings that should fall on him. And all this the true Servant-Scholar accepts willingly. because it is his Father's will. Here again we cannot fail to trace the influence of Isaiah's words in all our Lord's utterances as to His passion. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-34.htm" title="And they shall mock him, and shall whip him, and shall spit on him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Mark 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm" title="For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:">Luke 18:32</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath opened mine ear</span>. Some understand this of the boring of the ear for perpetual service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>); but it is perhaps better to regard it as intended to mark a contrast between the true Servant and the professed servants, or children of Israel. They "did not hear; their ear was <span class="accented">not</span> opened; they were treacherous and rebellious from the womb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>). His ear was opened to receive God's word perpetually; he was not rebellious, did not turn away back. Even when most tried, his final word was, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:4-9 As Jesus was God and man in one person, we find him sometimes speaking, or spoken of, as the Lord God; at other times, as man and the servant of Jehovah. He was to declare the truths which comfort the broken, contrite heart, those weary of sin, harassed with afflictions. And as the Holy Spirit was upon him, that he might speak as never man spake; so the same Divine influence daily wakened him to pray, to preach the gospel, and to receive and deliver the whole will of the Father. The Father justified the Son when he accepted the satisfaction he made for the sin of man. Christ speaks in the name of all believers. Who dares to be an enemy to those unto whom he is a Friend? or who will contend with those whom he is an Advocate? Thus St. Paul applies it, Ro 8:33.</body></html>
