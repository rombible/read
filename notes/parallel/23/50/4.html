As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-4.htm" title="Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.">Isaiah 49:4</a>, the speaker is the Servant of Jehovah, not Isaiah, though we may legitimately trace in what follows some echoes of the prophet's own experience. The union of the two names Adonai Jahveh (or Jehovah) indicates, as elsewhere, a special solemnity.<p><span class= "bld">The tongue of the learned.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">of a disciple, </span>or, well-trained scholar.<p><span class= "bld">That I should know how to speak.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that I should know how to sustain </span>(or, <span class= "ital">refresh</span>)<span class= "ital"> the weary with a word.</span><p><span class= "bld">He wakeneth.</span>--The daily teaching of the morning communion with God is contrasted by implication with the dreams and night visions of a less perfect inspiration. An illustration, perhaps a conscious fulfilment, may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-35.htm" title="And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.">Mark 1:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-42.htm" title="And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.">Luke 4:42</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To hear as the learned.</span>--Read <span class= "ital">disciples, </span>as before. The true Servant is also as a scholar, studious of the Master's will, as are other scholars.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - A SOLILOQUY OF THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH. The separateness of this passage has been maintained in the opening paragraph. That it is not of himself that the prophet here speaks, appears <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from the self-assertion (vers, 4, 5, 9); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the depth of humiliation declared in ver. 6, which is beyond anything recorded of Isaiah. But if he does not speak of himself, he can scarcely speak of any other besides "the Servant," of whom he has already said much (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>), and of whom he has still much more to say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the tongue of disciples</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a trained tongue, a well-taught tongue. Christ "did nothing of himself; as the Father had <span class="accented">taught</span> him," so he spoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I should know how to speak a word in season</span> to him that is weary; rather, <span class="accented">that I shall know how to sustain by a word him that is weary.</span> Compare, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He wakeneth morning by morning... mine ear.</span> God held immediate and constant communication with the "Servant" - not enlightening him occasionally, as he did the prophets, by dreams and visions, but continually whispering in his ear. At no time did the Father "leave him alone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>) or cease to speak to him. "Morning by morning" is not to be narrowed to the bare literal meaning, but to be taken in the sense of "un-interruptedly." <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">hear as the learned</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to hear as disciples hear</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> attentively, submissively, gladly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:4-9 As Jesus was God and man in one person, we find him sometimes speaking, or spoken of, as the Lord God; at other times, as man and the servant of Jehovah. He was to declare the truths which comfort the broken, contrite heart, those weary of sin, harassed with afflictions. And as the Holy Spirit was upon him, that he might speak as never man spake; so the same Divine influence daily wakened him to pray, to preach the gospel, and to receive and deliver the whole will of the Father. The Father justified the Son when he accepted the satisfaction he made for the sin of man. Christ speaks in the name of all believers. Who dares to be an enemy to those unto whom he is a Friend? or who will contend with those whom he is an Advocate? Thus St. Paul applies it, Ro 8:33.</body></html>
