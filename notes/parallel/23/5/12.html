It is difficult to identify the Hebrew instruments of music with modern names; but there seems to be no doubt that the <span class="accented">kinnor</span> was a sort of harp, and the <span class="accented">khalib</span> a sort of pipe. The <span class="accented">nebel</span>, generally rendered by "psaltery," but here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a> by "viol," was a stringed instrument played with the fingers (Josephus); perhaps a lyre, perhaps a sort of dulcimer. The <span class="accented">toph</span>, here translated "tabret," and elsewhere often "timbrel," was most likely a tambourine. All four instruments had in the earlier times been dedicated to the worship of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>); now they were employed to inflame men's passions at feasts. <span class="cmt_word">They regard not the work of the Lord</span>. The "work of Jehovah" is his manifestation of himself in history, more especially in the history of his chosen people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-4.htm">Psalm 92:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>, etc.). A pious Israelite was ever marveling at all that God had done for his nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-12.htm">1 Chronicles 16:12-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10-72</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-5.htm">Psalm 105:5-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5-24</a>, etc.). The men of Isaiah's generation had ceased to care for things of the past, and devoted themselves to enjoying the present. <span class="cmt_word">Neither consider</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>, "My people doth not consider"). The verb used is not, however, the same in the Hebrew. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth of the world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.</body></html>
