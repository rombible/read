The same men are apt also to call good evil; they brand prudence with the name of cunning, call meekness want of proper spirit, sincerity rudeness, and firmness obstinacy. This deadness to moral distinctions is the sign of deep moral corruption, and fully deserves to have a special "woe" pronounced against it. <span class="cmt_word">That put darkness for light</span>. "Light" and "darkness" symbolize good and evil throughout Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-13.htm">Proverbs 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, etc.). They are sometimes mere synonyms, as here; but sometimes they express rather the intellectual side of morality. <span class="cmt_word">Bitter for sweet</span>. More symbolism, but of a rarer kind. Jeremiah calls wickedness "bitter" (Jeremiah 2:9; 4:18), and the psalmist calls the judgments of God" sweet" (Psalm 109:103). But the terms are not often used with any moral bearing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth of the world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.</body></html>
