The parable with which it opens has for us the interest of having obviously supplied a starting-point for a later prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), and for our Lord's teaching in the like parable of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-33.htm" title="Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:">Matthew 21:33-41</a>. Here, however, there is the distinctive touch of the irony of the opening verse. The prophet presents himself, as it were, in the character of a minstrel, ready to sing to his hearers one of the love-songs in which their culture delighted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm" title="That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;">Amos 6:5</a>.) In its language and rhythm it reminds us of the Song of Solomon. The very word "beloved" recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/5-1.htm" title="I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.">Song of Solomon 5:1-2</a>; the description of the vineyards, that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/8-11.htm" title="Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.">Song of Solomon 8:11-13</a>. The probability that the parallelism was intentional is increased by the coincidence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand sliver coins, it shall even be for briers and thorns.">Isaiah 7:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-11.htm" title="Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>, which will meet us further on. On this assumption Isaiah's words have a special interest as showing how early that poem lent itself to a mystical interpretation. One might almost conjecture that the prophet allured the people to listen by music as well as words, and appeared, as Elisha and other prophets had done, with harp or pipe in hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm" title="But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.">2Kings 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was on Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.">1Samuel 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm" title="You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.">Isaiah 30:29</a>). The frequency of such hymns (Isaiah 12, 25, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/26-1.htm" title="In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.">Isaiah 26:1-4</a>) shows, at any rate, that the prophet had received the training of a psalmist. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">A song of my beloved.</span>--A slightly different reading adopted by some critics gives <span class= "ital">A song of love. </span>The "beloved" is purposely not named, but appears afterwards as none other than Jehovah. The word, closely connected with the ideal name Jedediah (the beloved of Jehovah; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm" title="And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.">2Samuel 12:25</a>), occurs in twenty-six passages of Song of Sol., and not elsewhere.<p><span class= "bld">A very fruitful hill.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a horn, the son of oil. </span>The combination "horn of oil" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.">1Samuel 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1Samuel 16:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.">1Kings 1:39</a>, suggests the thought that the phrase is equivalent to "the horn of the anointed" (Kay). The term "horn" was a natural synonym for a hill. So we have Matterhorn, Aarhorn, &c., in the Alps. Oil was naturally symbolic of fertility. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/80-8.htm" title="You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it.">Psalm 80:8-16</a>, we have a striking parallel. The "fruitful hill" was Canaan as a whole, with a special reference to Judah and Jerusalem. The "choicest vine"--literally, <span class= "ital">vine of Sorek </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-11.htm" title="Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), bearing a small dark purple grape--pointed back to the fathers of the nation, who, idealised in the retrospect, were as the heroes of faith compared with the then present generation. The picture which forms the parable might almost take its place among the <span class= "ital">Georgics </span>of Palestine. The vineyard on the hillside could not be ploughed, and therefore the stones had to be taken out by hand. It was fenced against the beasts of the field. There was a tower for a watchman to guard it against the attacks of robbers. (Comp. Virg. <span class= "ital">Georg. </span>ii. 399-419.) Each part has its own interpretation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - ISRAEL REBUKED BY THE PARABLE OF A VINEYARD. This chapter stands in a certain sense alone, neither closely connected with what precedes nor with what follows, excepting that it breathes throughout a tone of denunciation. There is also a want of connection between its parts, the allegory of the first section being succeeded by a series of rebukes for sins, expressed in the plainest language, and the rebukes being followed by a threat of punishment, also expressed with plainness. The resemblance of the parable with which the chapter opens to one of those delivered by our Lord, and recorded in the three synoptic Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9-16</a>), has been frequently noticed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now will I sing to my Well-beloved.</span> The prophet sings to Jehovah a song concerning his vineyard. The song consists of eight lines, beginning with "My Well-beloved," and ending with "wild grapes." It is in a lively, dancing measure, very unlike the general style of Isaiah's poetry. The name "Well-beloved" seems to be taken by the prophet from the Song of Songs, where it occurs above twenty times. It well expresses the feeling of a loving soul towards its Creator and Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">A song of my Well-beloved.</span> Bishop Lowth translates "A song of loves," and Mr. Cheyne "A love-song;" but this requires an alteration of the text, and is unsatisfactory from the fact that the song which follows is <span class="accented">not</span> a "love-song." May we not understand the words to mean "a song concerning my Well-beloved in respect of his vineyard?" <span class="cmt_word">Touching his vineyard</span>. Israel is compared to a "vine" in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>), and the Church of God to a "garden" in Canticles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>); perhaps also to a "vineyard" in the same book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-12.htm">Song of Solomon 8:12</a>). Isaiah may have had this last passage in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">My Beloved hath a vineyard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">had a vineyard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">In a very fruitful hill</span>. So the passage is generally understood, since <span class="accented">keren</span>, horn, is used for a height by the Arabs (as also by the Germans, e.g. Matterhorn, Wetterhorn, Aarhorn, etc.), and "son of oil" is a not unlikely Orientalism for "rich" or "fruitful." With the "hill" of this passage compare the "mountain" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, both passages indicating that the Church of God is set on aft eminence, and "cannot be hid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-7 Christ is God's beloved Son, and our beloved Saviour. The care of the Lord over the church of Israel, is described by the management of a vineyard. The advantages of our situation will be brought into the account another day. He planted it with the choicest vines; gave them a most excellent law, instituted proper ordinances. The temple was a tower, where God gave tokens of his presence. He set up his altar, to which the sacrifices should be brought; all the means of grace are denoted thereby. God expects fruit from those that enjoy privileges. Good purposes and good beginnings are good things, but not enough; there must be vineyard fruit; thoughts and affections, words and actions, agreeable to the Spirit. It brought forth bad fruit. Wild grapes are the fruits of the corrupt nature. Where grace does not work, corruption will. But the wickedness of those that profess religion, and enjoy the means of grace, must be upon the sinners themselves. They shall no longer be a peculiar people. When errors and vice go without check or control, the vineyard is unpruned; then it will soon be grown over with thorns. This is often shown in the departure of God's Spirit from those who have long striven against him, and the removal of his gospel from places which have long been a reproach to it. The explanation is given. It is sad with a soul, when, instead of the grapes of humility, meekness, love, patience, and contempt of the world, for which God looks, there are the wild grapes of pride, passion, discontent, and malice, and contempt of God; instead of the grapes of praying and praising, the wild grapes of cursing and swearing. Let us bring forth fruit with patience, that in the end we may obtain everlasting life.</body></html>
