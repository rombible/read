Ii. 14); in the "stones" that were gathered out, the removal of the old idolatries that would have hindered the development of the nation's life; in the "tower" of the vineyard (comp. in a different context <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>), the monarchy and throne of David, or the watch-tower from which the prophets looked forth (Hab. Ii. 1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/21-5.htm" title="Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.">Isaiah 21:5-8</a>); in the "winepress," the temple in which the fruits of righteousness were to issue in the wine of joy and adoration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-17.htm" title="For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.">Zechariah 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18</a>). It was, we may note, one of the maxims of the Rabbis that the duty of a scribe was "to set a fence around the law" (<span class= "ital">Pirke Aboth, </span>i. 1). In the last clause of the verse the pleasant song suddenly changes its tone, and the "wild grapes (sour and hard, and not larger than bilberries) are types of deeds of harsh and cruel injustice on which the prophet proceeds to dwell.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He fenced it.</span> So the LXX., the Vulgate, Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lowth, Kay. Gesenius, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne prefer to translate, "he dug it over;" while the Revisers of 1885 have suggested, "he made a trench about it." The word occurs only in this place, and has no cognates in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">And gathered out the stones</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). In the stony soil of Palestine, to collect the surface stones into heaps, or build them into walls, is of primary necessity for the improvement of the land. Conversely the stones were put back, and scattered over the land, by those who wished to "mar" it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Planted it with the choicest vine</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>). The <span class="accented">sorek</span> seems to have been a particular kind of vine, reckoned superior to others. The etymology of the word indicates that it was of a deep red color. <span class="cmt_word">Built a tower</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>). Towers had to be built in gardens, orchards, and vineyards, that watch might be kept from them against thieves and marauders (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-8.htm">1 Kings 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Made a wine-press</span>; literally, <span class="accented">dug a winepress</span>. The excavation was made to contain a vat, above which was the "press," worked by men, who wrung the liquor out of a great bag containing the grapes. (See the Egyptian rock-paintings, passim, where the operation is represented repeatedly.) <span class="cmt_word">It brought forth wild grapes.</span> The natural, not the cultivated fruit, a worthless product. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-7 Christ is God's beloved Son, and our beloved Saviour. The care of the Lord over the church of Israel, is described by the management of a vineyard. The advantages of our situation will be brought into the account another day. He planted it with the choicest vines; gave them a most excellent law, instituted proper ordinances. The temple was a tower, where God gave tokens of his presence. He set up his altar, to which the sacrifices should be brought; all the means of grace are denoted thereby. God expects fruit from those that enjoy privileges. Good purposes and good beginnings are good things, but not enough; there must be vineyard fruit; thoughts and affections, words and actions, agreeable to the Spirit. It brought forth bad fruit. Wild grapes are the fruits of the corrupt nature. Where grace does not work, corruption will. But the wickedness of those that profess religion, and enjoy the means of grace, must be upon the sinners themselves. They shall no longer be a peculiar people. When errors and vice go without check or control, the vineyard is unpruned; then it will soon be grown over with thorns. This is often shown in the departure of God's Spirit from those who have long striven against him, and the removal of his gospel from places which have long been a reproach to it. The explanation is given. It is sad with a soul, when, instead of the grapes of humility, meekness, love, patience, and contempt of the world, for which God looks, there are the wild grapes of pride, passion, discontent, and malice, and contempt of God; instead of the grapes of praying and praising, the wild grapes of cursing and swearing. Let us bring forth fruit with patience, that in the end we may obtain everlasting life.</body></html>
