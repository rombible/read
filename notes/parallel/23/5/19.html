Such taunts are not peculiar to any age or country. We find them in the speech of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm" title="But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?">1Kings 22:24</a>), in that of the mockers of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>.

Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:3</a>) we may probably find an answer to the taunt. The words "the counsel of the Holy One of Israel" were obviously emphasised with a sneer at the name on which Isaiah dwelt so constantly. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-11.htm" title="Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.">Isaiah 30:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That say, Let him make speed</span>, etc. Instead of trembling at the coming judgment of God, which Isaiah has announced, they pretend to desire its immediate arrival; they want to "see it." They walk, not by faith, but by sight. At the bottom of this pretended desire there lies a complete incredulity. <span class="cmt_word">The counsel</span>; or, purpose, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-26.htm">Isaiah 14:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Holy One of Israel.</span> They use one of Isaiah's favorite titles of God (see note on Isaiah L 4), not from any belief in him, but rather in a mocking spirit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth of the world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.</body></html>
