whose end is to be burned.">Hebrews 6:8</a>); (2) that of a tree decayed and loathsome. The double imagery represents the end of the riotous mirth of the unjust judges.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>, etc. A general judgment is now pronounced against all the forms of wickedness enumerated - a judgment of ruin or destruction. It is expressed by a mixed metaphor, or "combination of two figures," the former taken from the burning of stubble and withered grass by the farmer when he is cleaning his fields, the latter from the natural decay of a blossoming plant or tree. In either case the destruction is complete, but in the one it arises from an external force, fire; in the other from an internal failure of vitality. The ruin of Israel would include both; it would be brought about by an internal cause, their corruption, and an external one, God's anger. <span class="cmt_word">As the fire devoureth the stubble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a tongue of fire eats up stubble</span>. "<span class="accented">Tongue</span> of fire" is an unusual phrase, occurring in all Scripture only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>. But it well depicts the power of fire to lick up clean all that comes in its way. Isaiah elsewhere notes the analogy, making it the foundation of simile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the flame consumeth the chaff</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and as dry grass sinks down inflame</span>. The withered grass of pastures was burnt by farmers to improve the after-growth (Lucan, 'Pharsal.,' 9:182). <span class="cmt_word">Their root shall be as rottenness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>). The root is the last thing to decay. When that fails, the case is desperate. Judah's "root" did not utterly fail (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>); but the present warning is to individuals and classes (vers. 8, 11, 18, 20-23), not to the nation. <span class="cmt_word">Their blossom shall go up as dust</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their external glory shall crumble and waste away. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have cast away the Law.</span> All the sins of Israel had this one thing in common - they were transgressions of the Law of God as delivered to them by Moses, and enforced upon them by the prophetical order (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Despised the word</span>; or, <span class="accented">the speech</span>. <span class="accented">Imrah</span> is rarely used by Isaiah. It does not refer to the written "Word," but to the declarations of God by the mouth of his prophets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:24-30 Let not any expect to live easily who live wickedly. Sin weakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law cast away, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them? When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes even great men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can find instruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, and afterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which way they will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance, that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself will be the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.</body></html>
