The form of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.">Luke 6:24-26</a> seems based upon it. The general indictment of Isaiah 1 is followed by special counts. That which leads off the list was the destruction of the old village life of Palestine. The original ideal of the nation had been that it should consist of small proprietors; and the Jubilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm" title="In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.">Leviticus 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-24.htm" title="In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.">Leviticus 27:24</a>), and the law of the marriage of heiresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1-11</a>, Numbers 36, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm" title="And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.">Numbers 33:54</a>) were intended as safeguards for the maintenance of that ideal. In practice it had broken down, and might had taken the place of right.

In place of the small freeholders there rose up a class of large proprietors, often the <span class= "ital">novi homines </span>of the state (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Shebna in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm" title="What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that engraves an habitation for himself in a rock?">Isaiah 22:16</a>), while the original owners sank into slavery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>) or became tenants at will, paying exorbitant rents in kind or money, and liable at any moment to be evicted. Isaiah's complaint recalls the agrarian laws by which first Licinius and then the Gracchi sought to restrain the extension of the <span class= "ital">latifundia </span>of the Roman patricians, and Latimer's bold protest against the enclosure of commons in the sixteenth century. The evil had been denounced before by Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm" title="And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.">Micah 2:2</a>), and in a psalm probably contemporary with Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm" title="Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.">Psalm 49:11</a>). The fact that the last year of Uzziah coincided with the Jubilee may have given a special point to Isaiah's protest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-24.</span> - THE SIX WOES. After the general warning conveyed to Israel by the parable of the vineyard, six sins are particularized as those which have especially provoked God to give the warning. On each of these woe is denounced. Two have special punishments assigned to them (vers. 8-17); the remainder are joined in one general threat of retribution (vers. 18 - 24). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that join house to house</span>. This is <span class="accented">the first woe</span>. It is pronounced on the greed which leads men to continually enlarge their estates, without regard to their neighbors' convenience. Nothing is said of any use of unfair means, much <span class="accented">less</span> of violence in dispossessing the former proprietors. What is denounced is the selfishness of vast accumulations of land in single bands, to the detriment of the rest of the community. The Jewish law was peculiarly inimical to this practice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>); but perhaps it is not without reason that many writers of our own time object to it on general grounds. <span class="cmt_word">Till there be no place</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till want of place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till there is no room for others. A hyperbole, doubtless, but marking a real national inconvenience. That they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth; rather, <span class="accented">that ye may dwell by yourselves in the midst of the land</span>. The great landlords wished to isolate themselves; they disliked neighbors; they would fain "dwell by themselves," without neighbors to trouble them. Uzziah seems, by what is said of his possessions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>), to have been one of the greatest sinners in respect of the accumulation of land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth of the world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a field to purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when they have enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy the prosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. How applicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justly be disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures and the delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it draws away the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgments have seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruit of these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God of power. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared to be so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a woful condition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify their base lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; it is in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confound and overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their own reasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels and commands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continue profitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how light soever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to the wrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needs some other to conceal it.</body></html>
