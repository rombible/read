It seems to describe the sharp shrill whistle which was to the ear what the banner was to the eye, the signal of a rendezvous. Possibly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:18</a>, the idea of the bees swarming at the whistling of the bee-master is already in the prophet's thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">From the end of the earth.</span>--The words point to the Assyrians, the Euphrates being the boundary of Isaiah's political geography.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he will lift up an ensign.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, "a signal," and would so render the Hebrew word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-3.htm">Isaiah 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>. But "ensigns" or "standards" were in use both among the Egyptians (Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 121.) and among the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 461) before the time of Isaiah, and are, therefore, likely to have been in use among the Hebrews. The standards, however, of this early period were not flags, as Jarchi supposes, but solid constructions of wood or metal, exhibiting some emblem or other. God lifts up his standard to draw the nations together, indicating thereby that they are to fight his battles. <span class="cmt_word">And will hiss</span>. "Hissing" is said to have been practiced by bee-keepers to draw their bees out of the hives in the morning, and bring them home again from the fields at nightfall (Cyril, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). God will collect an army against Israel, as such persons collect their bees (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the end of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to <span class="accented">bring them</span> from the end of the earth." The nations are, or at least many of them are, extremely distant, as Elamites from the Persian Gulf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), and perhaps Medes from beyond Zagros. <span class="cmt_word">They shall come</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he cometh</span>; showing that, though the nations are many, they are united under one head, which here is probably the Assyrian power. <span class="cmt_word">With speed swiftly</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>). The reference is not so much to the speed with which the Assyrians marched, as to the immediate response which they would make to God's call, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:24-30 Let not any expect to live easily who live wickedly. Sin weakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law cast away, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them? When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes even great men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can find instruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, and afterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which way they will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance, that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself will be the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.</body></html>
