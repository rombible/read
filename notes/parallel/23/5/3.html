Those to whom the parable applies are invited, as David was by Nathan, to pass an unconscious judgment on themselves. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-40.htm" title="When the lord therefore of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?">Matthew 21:40-41</a>, as an instance of the same method.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The prophet's "song" here ends, and Jehovah himself takes the word. As if the story told in the parable had been a fact, he calls on the men of Judah and Jerusalem to "judge between him and his vineyard." Compare Nathan's appeal to David by the parable of the ewe lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-7 Christ is God's beloved Son, and our beloved Saviour. The care of the Lord over the church of Israel, is described by the management of a vineyard. The advantages of our situation will be brought into the account another day. He planted it with the choicest vines; gave them a most excellent law, instituted proper ordinances. The temple was a tower, where God gave tokens of his presence. He set up his altar, to which the sacrifices should be brought; all the means of grace are denoted thereby. God expects fruit from those that enjoy privileges. Good purposes and good beginnings are good things, but not enough; there must be vineyard fruit; thoughts and affections, words and actions, agreeable to the Spirit. It brought forth bad fruit. Wild grapes are the fruits of the corrupt nature. Where grace does not work, corruption will. But the wickedness of those that profess religion, and enjoy the means of grace, must be upon the sinners themselves. They shall no longer be a peculiar people. When errors and vice go without check or control, the vineyard is unpruned; then it will soon be grown over with thorns. This is often shown in the departure of God's Spirit from those who have long striven against him, and the removal of his gospel from places which have long been a reproach to it. The explanation is given. It is sad with a soul, when, instead of the grapes of humility, meekness, love, patience, and contempt of the world, for which God looks, there are the wild grapes of pride, passion, discontent, and malice, and contempt of God; instead of the grapes of praying and praising, the wild grapes of cursing and swearing. Let us bring forth fruit with patience, that in the end we may obtain everlasting life.</body></html>
