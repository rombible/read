It bids the people remember after each woe that this is not all. They do not as yet see the end of the chastisement through which God is leading them. "For all this" may mean (1) because of all the sins, or (2) notwithstanding all the punishment already inflicted.

Hints have been already given that the judgment which is to fall on the nation is a foreign war, or a series of foreign wars (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>). But now for the first time a terrible invasion, in which many nations will participate, is clearly announced. At first the imagery is obscure (ver. 25), but it soon grows more distinct. "Nations" are summoned to the attack; a vast army comes, and comes" with speed swiftly" (ver. 26); then their array is described (vers. 27, 28); and finally their ravin is compared to that of lions, and their success in catching and carrying off their prey is prophesied (ver. 29). In the last verse of the chapter the prophet falls back into vaguer imagery, comparing the roar of the invaders to the roaring of the sea, and the desolated land to one seen under the gloom of a preternatural darkness (ver. 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The threats of this verse are all vague and general, for there is no reason to suppose that the phrase," the hills did tremble, "refers to an actual earthquake. That there was an earthquake in the reign of Uzziah is, indeed, clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; but it was probably a thing of the past when Isaiah wrote this chapter, and he is spiking of the future. A "trembling of the hills" is, in prophetic language, a commotion among the chief men of the land. <span class="cmt_word">He hath stretched forth his hand.</span> Again the "perfect of prophetic certitude." <span class="cmt_word">Their carcasses were torn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">were as refuse</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-45.htm">Lamentations 3:45</a>). There would be many slain, and lying unburied, in the streets of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">For all this</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21</a>, and Isaiah 10:4, where the same words are used as a refrain). The words imply that God's judgment upon Judah will not be a single stroke, but a continuous smiting, covering some considerable space of time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:24-30 Let not any expect to live easily who live wickedly. Sin weakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law cast away, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them? When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes even great men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can find instruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, and afterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which way they will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance, that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself will be the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.</body></html>
