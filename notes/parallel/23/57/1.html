Even before that persecution burst out in its full violence, the "righteous" survivors of Hezekiah's <span class= "ital">regime </span>may well have vexed their souls even to death with the evils that were around them. The prophet finds comfort in the thought that their death was a deliverance from yet worse evils. The singular number points to the few conspicuous sufferers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - THE EARLY DEATH OF RIGHTEOUS MEN ACCOUNTED FOR. The Hebrews were given to expect that long life should, as a general rule, accompany righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-16.htm">Psalm 91:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1, 2</a>, etc.); and under the Mosaical dispensation we must suppose that it did so. But there were exceptions to the rule. Wicked persecutors, like Ahab, Jezebel, and Athaliah, cut off the righteous ere they had seen half their days. So probably did Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3, 4</a>). And God sometimes removed the righteous from earth by a natural death before they had grown old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>). At the time of which Isaiah is here speaking there had been such removals; and of this he takes note, partly to rebuke those who lightly passed over the phenomenon, partly to justify God's ways to such as were perplexed by it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The righteous perisheth</span>. The word translated "perisheth" does not imply any violence; but the context implies a premature death. The righteous disappear - are taken from the earth before their natural time. Yet no man layeth it to heart; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no one asks what it means - no one is disturbed, no one grieves. The general feeling was either one of indifference, or of relief at the departure of one whose life was a reproach to his neighbours. Merciful men; rather, <span class="accented">godly men</span>, or <span class="accented">pious men</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>). Are taken away; literally, <span class="accented">are gathered in.</span> Compare the phrase so frequently used, "gathered to his fathers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-13.htm">Numbers 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-28.htm">2 Chronicles 34:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the evil</span>; or, <span class="accented">out of the way of the evil -</span> in order that he may escape it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>, where Josiah is promised that he shall be gathered to his fathers (prematurely), in order that he may escape the sight of the evil that was coming on Jerusalem soon after his decease. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:1,2 The righteous are delivered from the sting of death, not from the stroke of it. The careless world disregards this. Few lament it as a public loss, and very few notice it as a public warning. They are taken away in compassion, that they may not see the evil, nor share in it, nor be tempted by it. The righteous man, when he dies, enters into peace and rest.</body></html>
