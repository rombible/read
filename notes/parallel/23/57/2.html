(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm" title="There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.">Job 3:17</a>.) For the righteous there was peace in death as in life.

(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-25.htm" title="They have set her a bed in the middle of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the middle of them that be slain.">Ezekiel 32:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Each one walking in his uprightness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">every one who has walked straight before him</span>--has taken, i.e., the straight path of duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-21.htm" title="And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk you in it, when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left.">Isaiah 30:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - He shall enter into peace. Not merely into "stillness" or "silence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>), but into "peace," or, as the word might be rendered (Cheyne), "a state of peace." There is, no doubt, primarily, "<span class="accented">a</span> contrast to the awful troubles which the survivors will have to encounter" (Hengstenberg); but perhaps this contrast is not all that is meant. The "peace" is positive rather than negative, or it would scarcely be a consolation to any one. They shall rest in their beds; or, <span class="accented">upon their beds.</span> This expression seems to imply a consciousness of rest, and so a certain enjoyment of it. Each one walking in his uprightness; rather, <span class="accented">whosoever hath walked uprightly</span>, or <span class="accented">in a straight path</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>). The phrase is an equivalent for "the righteous" of ver. 1, and refers to the life on earth of those who have gone down into silence, not to their life after they have reached the silent shore. Of that life the evangelical prophet is not commissioned to give us any information. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:1,2 The righteous are delivered from the sting of death, not from the stroke of it. The careless world disregards this. Few lament it as a public loss, and very few notice it as a public warning. They are taken away in compassion, that they may not see the evil, nor share in it, nor be tempted by it. The righteous man, when he dies, enters into peace and rest.</body></html>
