<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm" title="And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>); and the prophet is supposed to point to the fact that this had been written <span class= "ital">behind </span>the door, as showing that Israel had been ashamed to confess her creed. The explanation seems tenable, but it is possible that "remembrance" may stand for some idolatrous symbol or inscription which had been substituted for the true confession.<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast discovered thyself.</span>--The figure of the unfaithful wife is carried into its details almost with Ezekiel's boldness.<p><span class= "bld">Made thee a covenant with them . . .</span>--The noun, as the italics show, is implied in the verb.

But, in the first place, there is no evidence that anciently these passages were understood literally, or that such inscriptions were ever set up; and secondly, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, they would have been more, rather than less, conspicuous in a new place. Probably, therefore, the "memorial" (<span class="accented">zikkaron</span>) of this place is some idolatrous symbol or emblem newly adopted by the Jews, and made use of as a sort of talisman. Many commentators think that it was of a phallic character (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>). Discovered thyself; rather, <span class="accented">uncovered thyself. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou hast enlarged thy bed</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> multiplied thy idolatries (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-7</a>). It is a feature of the idolatry of the time, that it was a mixture adopted from many quarters. It included Baal and Ashtoreth-worship from Phoenicia, Moloch-worship from Moab and Ammos, worship of the Queen of Heaven from Syria, high-place worship from the Canaanites, and stone-worship from their own remote Mesopotamian ancestors. And made thee a covenant with them; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a bargain for wages," that aid and protection should be rendered in return for worship and sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">Where thou sawest it</span>. The original is very obscure, but can scarcely have this meaning. It is certainly a distinct clause, and may perhaps be best translated, "thou sawest indecency." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appear before him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.</body></html>
