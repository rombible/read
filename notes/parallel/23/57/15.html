The truth of the greatness of lowliness manifested in the life of Christ was but the reflection of the permanent law of the Divine government. The "high and holy place" is, of course, the heavenly temple, the "light inaccessible."

The prophet, in this portion of his discourse, whereof "comfort" is the key-note (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>), can never continue threatening long without relapsing into a tone of tenderness and pity. He now sets against his long denunciation (in vers. 3-12) an ample promise (vers. 15-19), and against his brief encouragement (in vers. 13, 14) a short menace (vers. 20, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. The ground of the promise of salvation in ver. 15 is God's combined might and mercy, which are now set forth. <span class="cmt_word">The high and lofty One</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where the same words are translated "high and lifted up"). In God's loftiness are included at once his exalted majesty and his almighty power. He is "high" in himself, transcending thought, and "lofty" or "lifted up" in that he is absolute Lord of his creatures, and therefore high above them. <span class="cmt_word">That inhabiteth eternity</span>. So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> But the Hebrew is less abstract, and would perhaps be best translated "that liveth eternally." <span class="cmt_word">I dwell in the high and holy place</span>. Solomon's "heaven of heavens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), which, however, "cannot contain him;" St. Paul's "light which no man can approach unto" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); Zechariah's "holy habitation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>). With him also that is of a contrite - literally, <span class="accented">crushed -</span> and humble spirit. "Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>); "He humbleth himself to consider the things that are in heaven and earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>). He is not an Epicurean Deity, too far exalted above man to have any regard for him, or concern himself with man's welfare (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12, 13</a>). On the contrary, he condescends to "dwell with" man, only let man have a "humble" and "crushed," or "bruised," spirit. <span class="cmt_word">To revive the spirit of the humble</span>. When God condescends to visit the contrite and humble spirit, the immediate effect is to comfort, console, revive. His presence is a well of life. springing up within the soul to everlasting life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:13-21 The idols and their worshippers shall come to nothing; but those who trust in God's grace, shall be brought to the joys of heaven. With the Lord there is neither beginning of days, nor end of life, nor change of time. His name is holy, and all must know him as a holy God. He will have tender regard to those who bring their mind to their condition, and dread his wrath. He will make his abode with those whose hearts he has thus humbled, in order to revive and comfort them. When troubles last long, even good men are tempted to entertain hard thoughts of God. Therefore He will not contend for ever, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands, nor defeat the purchase of his Son's blood. Covetousness is a sin that particularly lays men under the Divine displeasure. See the sinfulness of sin. See also that troubles cannot reform men unless God's grace work in them. Peace shall be published, perfect peace. It is the fruit of preaching lips, and praying lips. Christ came and preached peace to Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; to after-ages, who were afar off in time, as well as to those of that age. But the wicked would not be healed by God's grace, therefore would not be healed by his comforts. Their ungoverned lusts and passions made them like the troubled sea. Also the terrors of conscience disturbed their enjoyments. God hath said it, and all the world cannot unsay it, That there is no peace to those who allow themselves in any sin. If we are recovered from such an awful state, it is only by the grace of God. And the influences of the Holy Spirit, and that new heart, from whence comes grateful praise, the fruit of our lips, are his gift. Salvation, with all its fruits, hopes, and comforts, is his work, and to him belongs all the glory. There is no peace for the wicked man; but let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.</body></html>
