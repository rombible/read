The reference is, as Mr. Cheyne says, to the "orgiastic cults' in the sacred groves of Palestinian heathenism." The nature of these cults is well stated by Professor Dollinger ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 430): "At the spring festival, called by some the 'brand-feast,' by others that of torches, which was attended by streams of visitors from every country, huge trees were burnt, with the offerings suspended on them. Even children were sacrificed; they were put into a leathern bag, and thrown the whole height of the temple to the bottom, with the shocking expression that they were calves, and not children. In the fore-court stood two gigantic phalli. To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement; and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose<span class="cmt_word">." Slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks.</span> The sacrifice of their children to Moloch was largely practised by the Jews in the later period of the kingdom of Judah. It seems to have been originally introduced by the superstitious Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, who "made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). Suspended during the reign of Hezekiah, it was renewed under Manasseh, who followed the example of his grandfather in himself sacrificing one of his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Under the last three kings it prevailed to a very wide extent, and the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel are loud in their denunciations of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>, etc.). Arguments have been brought forward to prove that the child was merely passed before a fire, or between two fires, and not burnt; but the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming (see the article on "Moloch" in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 2, pp. 403, 404). The rite belonged especially to the worship of Chemosh and Moloch by the Moabites and Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>), from whom it was adopted by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7</a>) and Jews. The sacrifice was supposed to be expiatory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). In the later times of the Jewish kingdom the place of sacrifice was the valley of Hinnom, west and north of Jerusalem, which is overhung by rugged rocks. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appear before him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.</body></html>
