</span>and this may be the meaning even of the text as it stands. Looking to the Manasseh-surroundings of the passage, however, it is more natural to refer the words to the king, the great king of Assyria, whose religion Judah had basely and shamefully adopted. The sin of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-11.htm" title="And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.">2Kings 16:11</a>) had been reproduced by his grandson. The description that follows is that of a harlot adorning herself for her evil calling, and finds its best illustration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/7-14.htm" title="I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.">Proverbs 7:14-17</a>. Looking to the previous traces of Isaiah's study of that book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-4</a>, &c) we may, perhaps, find in it a deliberate reproduction of that passage. The "ointment" and "perfumes" are symbols of the treasures which were lavished to secure the Assyrian alliance. The words help us to understand Isaiah's indignation at what must have seemed to him the initial step of a like policy on the part of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/39-3.htm" title="Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from where came they to you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.">Isaiah 39:3-7</a>). The words which point to the "far-off" land, to which the messengers were sent, seem almost like an echo from that king's apology.<p><span class= "bld">Even unto hell</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Hades or Sheol, the world of the dead--as the symbol of an abysmal depth of degradation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou wentest to the king</span>, Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne understand "the King of Assyria," and regard the verse as bringing forward a new subject of complaint: "<span class="accented">Not</span> only hast thou deserted me tot other gods, but thou trustest for aid, not to me, but to the Assyrian monarch." But there is no indication of the Jews having put any trust in <span class="accented">Assyria</span> after the reign of Ahaz, to which this chapter, by its position in the prophecy, cannot belong. Moreover, the King of <span class="accented">Assyria is</span> never called simply" the king." It is, therefore, better to regard "the king" as Moloch, whom the Jews of Isaiah's time certainly worshipped (see ver. 5), and whose name was a mere dialectic variety of <span class="accented">Melech</span>, "<span class="accented">king"</span> (see Dean Payne Smith's ' Sermons on Isaiah,' sermon 4. p. 119). <span class="cmt_word">Ointment... perfumes</span>. Either bearing them as offerings, or herself perfumed with them, as was the practice of lewd women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-17.htm">Proverbs 7:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And didst send thy messengers far off</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to distant Moloch-shrines. <span class="cmt_word">And didst debase thyself even unto hell</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "didst take on thee the yoke of a mean and grovelling superstition, which debased thee to the lowest point conceivable." There was nothing lower in religion than the worship of Moloch. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appear before him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.</body></html>
