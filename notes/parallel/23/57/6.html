Smooth stones, rounded by water-action, were among the objects worshipped by many Semitic peoples. Such stones were called <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> - Bethels, or "houses of God " - and received libations of oil and wine from their worshippers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>; and comp. Herod., 3:8; Arnob., 'Adv. Gentes,' 1:39; Lucian, 'Pseudomant.,' p. 30; Apul., p. 349; etc.). Stones of this kind, the prophet says, had now become "the portion" of Israel, instead of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>). To such objects they offered their "meat offerings" and "drink offerings." <span class="cmt_word">Should I receive comfort in these?</span> Can I, Jehovah, be comforted, when my people indulge in such practices? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appear before him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened with judgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty of idolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Their zeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in the worship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery; those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have their portion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholy passions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if they think it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for some favourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, or antichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for their hope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsake the only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sin soon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of God and his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; it ruins and destroys.</body></html>
