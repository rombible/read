So duly, so constantly, and with such advantage to mankind, will the Lord God cause righteousness and praise to spring forth.

Let us be earnest in prayer, that the Lord God may cause that righteousness to spring forth among us, which constitutes the excellence and glory of the Christian profession.</body></html>
