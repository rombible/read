The implied thought of the whole passage is, as in the next verse, that all Israel is raised to the dignity of a priestly caste, leaving the rough work of the world to be done by foreigners, who stood on a lower level. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/38-31.htm" title="All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work.">Ecclesiasticus 38:31-34</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/61.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>). The Gentiles who join themselves with the Jews, and form with them one community, are constantly represented in the writings of Isaiah as occupying a subordinate position. In the New Testament, Jew and Gentile are put upon a par. Is the explanation that Isaiah assumes that the Jews generally will accept the gospel, and therefore, to some extent, retain their privileges in the new community, whereas, in fact, they rejected the gospel, and so lost their natural position (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7-20</a>)? Or does Isaiah look onward to a later date? And is there to be a restoration of "Israel according to the flesh" upon their conversion, and a reinstatement of them in a position of privilege? Such a condition of things seems glanced at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-23.htm">Romans 11:23-29</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your</span> <span class="cmt_word">vinedressers.</span> Not so much compelled, like the Gibeonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21-27</a>), to perform menial offices, as undertaking them voluntarily out of good will. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/61.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>61:4-9 Promises are here made to the Jews returned out of captivity, which extend to all those who, through grace, are delivered out of spiritual thraldom. An unholy soul is like a city that is broken down, and has no walls, like a house in ruins; but by the power of Christ's gospel and grace, it is fitted to be a habitation of God, through the Spirit. When, by the grace of God, we attain to holy indifference as to the affairs of this world; when, though our hands are employed about them, our hearts are not entangled with them, but preserved entire for God and his service, then the sons of the alien are our ploughmen and vine-dressers. Those whom He sets at liberty, he sets to work. His service is perfect freedom; it is the greatest honour. All believers are made, to our God, kings and priests; and always ought to conduct themselves as such. Those who have the Lord for their portion, have reason to say, that they have worthy portion, and to rejoice in it. In the fulness of heaven's joys we shall receive more than double for all our services and sufferings. God desires truth, and therefore hates all injustice. Nor will it justify any man's robbery to say, it was for burnt-offerings; and that robbery is most hateful which is under this pretence. Let the children of godly parents be such, that all may see the fruits of a good education; an answer to the prayers for them, in the fruit of God's blessing.</body></html>
