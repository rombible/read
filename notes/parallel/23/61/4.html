Having proclaimed the objects of his own mission, "the Servant" proceeds to declare God's gracious purposes towards Israel. Taking the Captivity period for his standpoint, he promises, first, the restoration of the cities of Judah (ver. 4), and then a flourishing time in which Jews and Gentiles shall dwell together in one community peacefully and gloriously, Israel having a certain pre-eminence (vers. 5-9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall build</span> <span class="cmt_word">the old wastes.</span> (On the "waste" condition, not of Jerusalem only, but of the cities of Judith generally, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a>, etc.) The first step in the recovery of Israel from the misery of the Captivity would be a return to Palestine, and a general restoration of the ruined towns. It was a ruin of "many generations," having commenced, probably, with the invasion of Pharaoh-Necho in <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>, and being continued till the edict of Cyrus ( <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/61.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>61:4-9 Promises are here made to the Jews returned out of captivity, which extend to all those who, through grace, are delivered out of spiritual thraldom. An unholy soul is like a city that is broken down, and has no walls, like a house in ruins; but by the power of Christ's gospel and grace, it is fitted to be a habitation of God, through the Spirit. When, by the grace of God, we attain to holy indifference as to the affairs of this world; when, though our hands are employed about them, our hearts are not entangled with them, but preserved entire for God and his service, then the sons of the alien are our ploughmen and vine-dressers. Those whom He sets at liberty, he sets to work. His service is perfect freedom; it is the greatest honour. All believers are made, to our God, kings and priests; and always ought to conduct themselves as such. Those who have the Lord for their portion, have reason to say, that they have worthy portion, and to rejoice in it. In the fulness of heaven's joys we shall receive more than double for all our services and sufferings. God desires truth, and therefore hates all injustice. Nor will it justify any man's robbery to say, it was for burnt-offerings; and that robbery is most hateful which is under this pretence. Let the children of godly parents be such, that all may see the fruits of a good education; an answer to the prayers for them, in the fruit of God's blessing.</body></html>
