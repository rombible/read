The Jewish Targum and many modern critics hear only the voice of Isaiah. Guided by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm" title="Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-4.htm" title="Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.">Isaiah 1:4-9</a>, we recognise here, as there, the utterance of the ideal Servant of Jehovah. That view, it needs scarcely be said, is the one suggested to all Christian minds by our Lord's application of the passage to His own work in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16-22</a>. The opening words repeat what had been said by Jehovah of the Servant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>. The "anointing," as it stands, might be that of king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-16.htm" title="To morrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.">1Samuel 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1Samuel 10:1</a>), or priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-2.htm" title="And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shall you make them.">Exodus 29:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-36.htm" title="Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.">Leviticus 7:36</a>), or prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>).

To this passage, more than any other, even than <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-9.htm" title="O Zion, that bring good tidings, get you up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bring good tidings, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!">Isaiah 40:9</a>, we may trace the use of the word "gospel" ("evangel," "good tidings") in our Lord's teaching and that of the Apostles. Claiming the promise as fulfilled in Himself, He became the great evangelist, and all who followed Him were called to the same office.<p><span class= "bld">To bind up the broken-hearted . . .</span>--The primary thought is that of a healing bandage applied to the heart's wounds.

The words of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>, "This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears," preclude the application of this passage to any other than the Lord himself. It is simply astonishing that some Christian commentators (Ewald, Hitzig, Knobel) have not seen the force of this argument, but, with the Jews, imagine the prophet to be speaking of his own ministry. It is contrary to the entire spirit of Isaiah's writings so to glorify himself, and specially unsuitable that, after having brought forward with such emphasis the Person of "the Servant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>), he should proceed to take his place, and to "ascribe to himself those very same official attributes which he has already set forth as characteristic features in his portrait of the predicted One" (Delitzsch). Hence most recent commentators, whatever their school of thought, have acquiesced in the patristic interpretation, which regarded the Servant of Jehovah as here speaking of himself. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">Adonai Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented">is upon me.</span> The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and one manuscript omit <span class="accented">adonai.</span> In the original announcement of "the Servant" it was stated that God had "put his Spirit upon him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). The sanctification of our Lord's human nature by the Holy Spirit is very explicitly taught in the Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-10.htm">Mark 1:10, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1, 14, 18-21</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath anointed me</span>. The "anointing" of Jesus was that sanctification of his human nature by the Holy Spirit, which commenced in the womb of the blessed Virgin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>), which continued as he grew to manhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40, 52</a>), which was openly manifested at his baptism, and never ceased till he took his body and soul with him into heaven. Of this spiritual anointing, all material unction, whether under the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-12, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15, 16</a>, etc.) or under the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>), was symbolical or typical. <span class="cmt_word">To preach good tidings</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-27.htm">Isaiah 41:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the meek</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bind</span> <span class="cmt_word">up the broken-hearted</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>, where this is declared to be the office of Jehovah himself). "Binding up" is an ordinary expression in Isaiah's writings for "healing" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-7.htm">Isaiah 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). To proclaim liberty to the captives. This was one of the special offices of "the Servant" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>). The "captivity" intended is doubtless that of sin. <span class="cmt_word">And the opening of the prison to them that are bound</span>. St. Luke, following the Septuagint, has, "and recovering of sight to the blind." It is thought by some that the original Hebrew text has been corrupted. Others regard the Septuagint rendering as a paraphrase. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/61.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>61:1-3 The prophets had the Holy Spirit of God at times, teaching them what to say, and causing them to say it; but Christ had the Spirit always, without measure, to qualify him, as man, for the work to which he was appointed. The poor are commonly best disposed to receive the gospel, Jas 2:5; and it is only likely to profit us when received with meekness. To such as are poor in spirit, Christ preached good tidings when he said, Blessed are the meek. Christ's satisfaction is accepted. By the dominion of sin in us, we are bound under the power of Satan; but the Son is ready, by his Spirit, to make us free; and then we shall be free indeed. Sin and Satan were to be destroyed; and Christ triumphed over them on his cross. But the children of men, who stand out against these offers, shall be dealt with as enemies. Christ was to be a Comforter, and so he is; he is sent to comfort all who mourn, and who seek to him, and not to the world, for comfort. He will do all this for his people, that they may abound in the fruits of righteousness, as the branches of God's planting. Neither the mercy of God, the atonement of Christ, nor the gospel of grace, profit the self-sufficient and proud. They must be humbled, and led to know their own character and wants, by the Holy Spirit, that they may see and feel their need of the sinner's Friend and Saviour. His doctrine contains glad tidings indeed to those who are humbled before God.</body></html>
