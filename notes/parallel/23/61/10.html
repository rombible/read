because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a>, the ideal Servant of Jehovah, who identifies himself with the people and slaves. The Targum, it may be noted, makes Jerusalem the speaker.<p><span class= "bld">The garments of salvation . . .</span>--The imagery is the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm" title="For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.">Isaiah 59:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm" title="To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.">Isaiah 61:3</a>, its entirely spiritual significance being, perhaps, still more strongly accentuated.<p><span class= "bld">As a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">wears a turban </span>(or <span class= "ital">mitre</span>)<span class= "ital">, as a priest. </span>It would appear from Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-11.htm" title="Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.">Song of Solomon 3:11</a> that bridegrooms wore a special head-dress on the day of their espousal, and this is here compared to the priestly "bonnet," or "mitre" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm" title="And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a turban, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and his sons, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-28.htm" title="And a turban of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,">Exodus 39:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-18.htm" title="They shall have linen bonnets on their heads, and shall have linen breeches on their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causes sweat.">Ezekiel 44:18</a>). On the special occasion which may have suggested the image, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/61.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - JERUSALEM ACCEPTS THE PROMISES, AND GLORIES IN JEHOVAH. So the Targum and Rosenmuller. Others think that "the Servant" is still speaking, or that Isaiah speaks in the name of the people. To us the exposition of the Targum appears the most satisfactory. It is in the manner of Isaiah suddenly to introduce a new speaker. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will greatly rejoice in the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a>). The promises made were such as naturally to call forth on the part of Israel the most heartfelt joy and rejoicing - including, as they did, restoration, rule over the Gentiles, a universal priesthood, a wide territory, "everlasting joy," a high renown, and an "everlasting covenant<span class="cmt_word">. He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a> and Isaiah 61:3). The metaphor occurs also in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a>). God clothes Israel with "righteousness" derived from himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>), and then with its natural consequence - "salvation." The result is to make Israel as a bridegroom who decketh himself with a priestly crown, and as a bride who adornoth herself with her jewels. That bridegrooms ordinarily wore crowns appears from the Mishna. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/61.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>61:10,11 Those only shall be clothed with the garments of salvation hereafter, that are covered with the robe of Christ's righteousness now, and by the sanctification of the Spirit have God's image renewed upon them. These blessings shall spring forth for ages to come, as the fruits of the earth. So duly, so constantly, and with such advantage to mankind, will the Lord God cause righteousness and praise to spring forth. They shall spread far; the great salvation shall be published and proclaimed, to the ends of the earth. Let us be earnest in prayer, that the Lord God may cause that righteousness to spring forth among us, which constitutes the excellence and glory of the Christian profession.</body></html>
