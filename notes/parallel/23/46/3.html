Israel should learn from the fate of the Babylonian idols to trust in Jehovah, who can and will deliver them, rather than in gods of gold and silver, which can give no aid, either to themselves or others. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the remnant of the house of Israel</span>. The address is not to those who had remained faithful of the ten tribes (as Delitzsch supposes), but to the captives of Babylon, designated in these later chapters indifferently as "Jacob" or "Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1, 21, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>, etc.), never as "Judah," and constantly mentioned as a "remnant" - all that was left of the oppressed and down-trodden nation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-16.htm">Isaiah 11:16</a>. etc.). Borne by me. Carried in the everlasting arms, as a child in the arms of its nurse or mother (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From the belly... from the womb</span>. From the very beginning of the national existence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:1-4 The heathen insulted the Jews, as if their idols Bel and Nebo were too hard for Jehovah. But their worshippers cannot help them; both the idols and the idolaters are gone into captivity. Let not God's people be afraid of either. Those things from which ungodly men expect safety and happiness, will be found unable to save them from death and hell. The true God will never fail his worshippers. The history of the life of every believer is a kind of abstract of the history of Israel. Our spiritual life is upheld by his grace, as constantly as our natural life by his providence. And God will never leave them. The Author will be the Finisher of their well-being, when, by decays, they need help as much as in infancy. This promise to Israel, enfeebled and grown old as a nation, is applicable to every aged follower of Christ. When compassed about with infirmities, and perhaps those around begin to grow weary of you, yet I am He that I have promised to be, He that you would have me to be. I will bear you up; carry you on in your way, and carry you home at last. If we learn to trust in and love him, we need not be anxious about our remaining days or years; he will still provide for us and watch over us, both as the creatures of his power, and as new-created by his Spirit.</body></html>
