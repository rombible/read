<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/89-34.htm" title="My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.">Psalm 89:34-35</a>), as the representative of the true King, whom Isaiah now contemplates as identical with the "servant of the Lord." For "sure mercies" read <span class= "ital">the unfailing loving-kindnesses, </span>which were "of David," as given to him and to his seed by Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/55.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come unto me</span> (comp. ver. 1, "Come ye to the waters"). God dispenses the waters (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will make an everlasting covenant with you</span>. That the "everlasting covenant" once made between God and man had been broken by man, and by Israel especially, is a part of the teaching contained in the earlier portion of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>). We find the same asserted in the prophecies of his contemporary, Hosea (Hosea 6:7). It would naturally follow from this that, unless God gave up man altogether, he would enter into a new covenant with him. Accordingly, this new covenant is announced, both in Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18-20</a>) and in the later chapters of Isaiah, repeatedly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-4.htm">Isaiah 56:4, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>). Having been thus set before the nation, it is further enlarged upon by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-60.htm">Ezekiel 16:60-62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26-28</a>). Almost all commentators allow that the Christian covenant is intended - that "new covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>) under which man obtains pardon and salvation through the Mediatorship of Christ<span class="cmt_word">. Even the sure mercies of David</span>. The "sure mercies of David" are the loving and merciful promises which God made to him. These included the promise that the Messiah should come of his seed, and sit on his throne, and establish an everlasting kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2-5, 19-37</a>), and triumph over death and hell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9, 10</a>), and give peace and happiness to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-15.htm">Psalm 132:15-18</a>). The promises made to David, rightly understood, involve all the essential points of the Christian covenant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/55.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>55:1-5 All are welcome to the blessings of salvation, to whom those blessings are welcome. In Christ there is enough for all, and enough for each. Those satisfied with the world, that see no need of Christ, do not thirst. They are in no uneasiness about their souls: but where God gives grace, he gives a thirst after it; and where he has given a thirst after it, he will give it. Come to Christ, for he is the Fountain opened, he is the Rock smitten. Come to holy ordinances, to the streams that make glad the city of our God. Come to the healing waters, come to the living waters, Re 22:17. Our Saviour referred to this, Joh 7:37. Come, and buy; make it your own by application of the grace of the gospel to yourselves. Come, and eat; make it still more your own, and enjoy it. The world comes short of our expectations; we promise ourselves, at least, water in it, and we are disappointed; but Christ outdoes our expectations. We come to him, and we find wine and milk. The gifts offered to us are such as no price can be set upon. The things offered are already paid for; for Christ purchased them at the full price of his own blood, 1Pe 1:19. Our wants are beyond number, and we have nothing to supply them; if Christ and heaven are ours, we see ourselves for ever indebted to free grace. Hearken diligently; let the proud heart stoop; not only come, but accept God's offers. All the wealth and pleasure in the world, will not yield solid comfort and content to the soul. They do not satisfy even the appetites of the body; for all is vanity and vexation. Let the disappointments we meet with in the world, help to drive us to Christ, and to seek for satisfaction in him only. Then, and not before, we shall find rest for our souls. Hear, and your soul shall live. On what easy terms is happiness offered us! By the sure mercies of David, we are to understand the Messiah. All his mercies are covenant mercies; they are purchased by him, they are promised in him, and out of his hand they are dispensed to us. We know not how to find the way to the waters, but Christ is given to be a Leader, a Commander, to show us what to do, and enable us to do it. Our business is to obey him, and follow him. And there is no coming to the Father but by him. He is the Holy One of Israel, true to his promises; and he has promised to glorify Christ, by giving him the heathen for his inheritance.</body></html>
