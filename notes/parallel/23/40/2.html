In <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm" title="Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.">Haggai 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-9.htm" title="The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm" title="And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.">Zechariah 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/2-5.htm" title="For I, said the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the middle of her.">Zechariah 2:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9-12</a>, we may rightly trace the influence of the words as working out their own fulfilment.<p><span class= "bld">That her warfare is accomplished.</span>--The time of war, with all its suffering, becomes the symbol of sufferings apart from actual war. The exile was one long campaign with enemies who were worse than the Babylonian conquerors. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-1.htm" title="Is there not an appointed time to man on earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?">Job 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm" title="If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.">Job 14:14</a>, the word is applied (rendered by "appointed time") to the battle of life from its beginning to its end. This, too, may be noted as one of the many parallelisms between Isaiah and Job.<p><span class= "bld">That her iniquity is pardoned.</span>--Strictly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm" title="And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:">Leviticus 26:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm" title="The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.">Leviticus 26:43</a>, <span class= "ital">is paid off, </span>or <span class= "ital">accepted. </span>The word implies not exemption from punishment, but the fact that the punishment had been accepted, and had done its work.<p><span class= "bld">She hath received of the Lord's hand . . .</span>--Primarily, the thought is that Jerusalem has suffered a more than sufficient penalty. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-9.htm" title="For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double to his neighbor.">Exodus 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-6.htm" title="Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double to her double according to her works: in the cup which she has filled fill to her double.">Revelation 18:6</a>.) This seems more in harmony with the context than the view which takes the meaning that Jerusalem shall receive a double measure of grace and favour. In the long run, however, the one meaning does not exclude the other. It is the mercy of Jehovah which reckons the punishment sufficient, because it has been "accepted" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm" title="And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:">Leviticus 26:41</a>), and has done its work. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-18.htm" title="And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.">Jeremiah 16:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem</span>; literally, <span class="accented">speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem.</span> Address her inmost feelings, her very spirit and soul. <span class="cmt_word">Her warfare is accomplished... is pardoned... hath received</span>. These perfects can only be viewed as "perfects of prophetic certainty." According to every theory of the authorship of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-46</a>, they were written before the close of the Captivity, when Israel's warfare was not yet accomplished, her iniquity not yet fully pardoned. Isaiah, however, sees all as already accomplished in the Divine counsels, and so announces it to the people. Israel's warfare, her long term of hard service (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a>), will assuredly come to an end; she will thoroughly turn to God, and then her iniquity will be pardoned, she will be considered to have suffered enough. Double. "It was the ordinary rule under the Law that 'for all manner of trespass' a man condemned by the judges should pay double" (Kay; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-9.htm">Exodus 22:9</a>). Heathen legislators adopted the same rule for certain offences (Arist, 'Eth. Nic.,' 3:5, &sect; 8). It is not here intended to assert that the law of Divine judgment is to exact double; but only to assure Israel that, having been amply punished, she need fear no further vengeance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-11 All human life is a warfare; the Christian life is the most so; but the struggle will not last always. Troubles are removed in love, when sin is pardoned. In the great atonement of the death of Christ, the mercy of God is exercised to the glory of his justice. In Christ, and his sufferings, true penitents receive of the Lord's hand double for all their sins; for the satisfaction Christ made by his death was of infinite value. The prophet had some reference to the return of the Jews from Babylon. But this is a small event, compared with that pointed out by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament, when John the Baptist proclaimed the approach of Christ. When eastern princes marched through desert countries, ways were prepared for them, and hinderances removed. And may the Lord prepare our hearts by the teaching of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, that high and proud thoughts may be brought down, good desires planted, crooked and rugged tempers made straight and softened, and every hinderance removed, that we may be ready for his will on earth, and prepared for his heavenly kingdom. What are all that belongs to fallen man, or all that he does, but as the grass and the flower thereof! And what will all the titles and possessions of a dying sinner avail, when they leave him under condemnation! The word of the Lord can do that for us, which all flesh cannot. The glad tidings of the coming of Christ were to be sent forth to the ends of the earth. Satan is the strong man armed; but our Lord Jesus is stronger; and he shall proceed, and do all that he purposes. Christ is the good Shepherd; he shows tender care for young converts, weak believers, and those of a sorrowful spirit. By his word he requires no more service, and by his providence he inflicts no more trouble, than he will strengthen them for. May we know our Shepherd's voice, and follow him, proving ourselves his sheep.</body></html>
