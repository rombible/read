The truth which he is to enforce thus solemnly is the ever-recurring contrast between the transitoriness of man and the eternity of God and of His word, taking that term in its highest and widest sense. Two points of interest may be noted: (1) that this is another parallelism with Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm" title="He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow, and continues not.">Job 14:2</a>); (2) the naturalness of the thought in one who, like Isaiah, was looking back, as Moses looked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/90-5.htm" title="You carry them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which grows up.">Psalm 90:5-6</a>) in extreme old age upon the generations whom he had survived, and forward to the fall of mighty monarchies one after another. The marginal references show how dominant the thought is in the mind of Isaiah. Isaiah himself had uttered it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-22.htm" title="Cease you from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?">Isaiah 2:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice said, Cry;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">voice of else that sayeth</span>, <span class="accented">Cry.</span> It is a second voice, distinct from that of ver. 3, that now reaches the prophet's ear - a voice responded to by another. The speakers seem to be angels, who contrast the perishable nature of man with the enduringness and unchangingness of God. The point of their discourse is that "the Word of the Lord endureth for ever" (ver. 8), and therefore the preceding promises (vers. 2, 5) are sure. <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and one said.</span> A second voice answered the first, and asked what the proclamation was to be. In reply its terms were given. <span class="cmt_word">All flesh is grass</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-27.htm">Isaiah 37:27</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-25.htm">Job 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.</span> So Ephraim was compared in ch. 28:1 to "a fading flower."

Troubles are removed in love, when sin is pardoned. In the great atonement of the death of Christ, the mercy of God is exercised to the glory of his justice. In Christ, and his sufferings, true penitents receive of the Lord's hand double for all their sins; for the satisfaction Christ made by his death was of infinite value. The prophet had some reference to the return of the Jews from Babylon. But this is a small event, compared with that pointed out by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament, when John the Baptist proclaimed the approach of Christ. When eastern princes marched through desert countries, ways were prepared for them, and hinderances removed. And may the Lord prepare our hearts by the teaching of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, that high and proud thoughts may be brought down, good desires planted, crooked and rugged tempers made straight and softened, and every hinderance removed, that we may be ready for his will on earth, and prepared for his heavenly kingdom. What are all that belongs to fallen man, or all that he does, but as the grass and the flower thereof! And what will all the titles and possessions of a dying sinner avail, when they leave him under condemnation! The word of the Lord can do that for us, which all flesh cannot. The glad tidings of the coming of Christ were to be sent forth to the ends of the earth. Satan is the strong man armed; but our Lord Jesus is stronger; and he shall proceed, and do all that he purposes. Christ is the good Shepherd; he shows tender care for young converts, weak believers, and those of a sorrowful spirit. By his word he requires no more service, and by his providence he inflicts no more trouble, than he will strengthen them for. May we know our Shepherd's voice, and follow him, proving ourselves his sheep.</body></html>
