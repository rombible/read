The combination is characteristic both of 1 and 2 Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm" title="What mean you that you beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? said the Lord GOD of hosts.">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not.">Isaiah 30:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">With strong hand.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">with, </span>or <span class= "ital">in strength of hand, </span>as the essence of His being. The "arm" of the Lord is a favourite phrase of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm" title="My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust.">Isaiah 51:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-10.htm" title="The LORD has made bore his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.">Isaiah 52:10</a>) for His power.<p><span class= "bld">His reward is with him . . .</span>--The noun "work" has also the sense of <span class= "ital">recompense </span>for the faithful worker (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-13.htm" title="You shall not defraud your neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with you all night until the morning.">Leviticus 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-15.htm" title="At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to the LORD, and it be sin to you.">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>, and is rightly taken in that sense here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-11.htm" title="Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the world, Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.">Isaiah 62:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Lord Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>With strong hand</span>; or, <span class="accented">with strength. <span class="cmt_word"></span>His arm shall rule for him</span>. Kay translates, "His arm shall get him rule;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the manifestation, which he shall make of his power, shall cause his kingdom to be extended far and wide upon the earth. "The Lord's arm," "the Lord's hand," are favourite expressions of Isaiah's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-3.htm">Isaiah 62:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">His reward is with him, and his work before him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his wage is with him</span>, <span class="accented">and his recompense before him - a</span> case of synonymous parallelism. The phrase is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>. Mr. Cheyne understands "the reward which God gives to his faithful ones" to be meant. But perhaps it is better to understand, with Dr. Kay, that in the "little flock" which he restores to Palestine God finds his own reward and recompense - the compensation for all his care and trouble. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-11 All human life is a warfare; the Christian life is the most so; but the struggle will not last always. Troubles are removed in love, when sin is pardoned. In the great atonement of the death of Christ, the mercy of God is exercised to the glory of his justice. In Christ, and his sufferings, true penitents receive of the Lord's hand double for all their sins; for the satisfaction Christ made by his death was of infinite value. The prophet had some reference to the return of the Jews from Babylon. But this is a small event, compared with that pointed out by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament, when John the Baptist proclaimed the approach of Christ. When eastern princes marched through desert countries, ways were prepared for them, and hinderances removed. And may the Lord prepare our hearts by the teaching of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, that high and proud thoughts may be brought down, good desires planted, crooked and rugged tempers made straight and softened, and every hinderance removed, that we may be ready for his will on earth, and prepared for his heavenly kingdom. What are all that belongs to fallen man, or all that he does, but as the grass and the flower thereof! And what will all the titles and possessions of a dying sinner avail, when they leave him under condemnation! The word of the Lord can do that for us, which all flesh cannot. The glad tidings of the coming of Christ were to be sent forth to the ends of the earth. Satan is the strong man armed; but our Lord Jesus is stronger; and he shall proceed, and do all that he purposes. Christ is the good Shepherd; he shows tender care for young converts, weak believers, and those of a sorrowful spirit. By his word he requires no more service, and by his providence he inflicts no more trouble, than he will strengthen them for. May we know our Shepherd's voice, and follow him, proving ourselves his sheep.</body></html>
