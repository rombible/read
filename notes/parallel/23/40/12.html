The whole passage in form and thought supplies once more a parallelism with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm" title="Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if you have understanding.">Job 38:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-25.htm" title="Who has divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;">Job 38:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-37.htm" title="Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,">Job 38:37</a>. The whole image is divinely anthropomorphic. The Creator is the great Work-master (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/13-1.htm" title="Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is: neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the workmaster;">Wisdom Of Solomon 13:1</a>) of the universe, ordering all things, like a human artificer, by number and weight and measure. The mountains of the earth are as dust in the scales of the Infinite.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-31.</span> - THE MIGHT AND GREATNESS OF GOD CONTRASTED WITH THE WEAKNESS OF MAN AND THE FUTILITY OF IDOLS. If captive Israel is to be induced to turn' to God, and so hasten the time of its restoration to his favour and to its own land, it must be by rising to a worthy conception of the nature and attributes of the Almighty. The prophet, therefore, in the remainder of this chapter, paints in glorious language the power and greatness, and at the same time the mercy, of God, contrasting him with man (vers. 15-17, 23, 28-31), with idols (vers. 19, 20), and with the framework of material things (vers. 21, 22, 26), and showing his infinite superiority to each and all. In contrasting him with man, he takes occasion to bring into prominence his goodness and loving-kindness to man, to whom he imparts a portion of his own might and strength (vers. 29-31 ). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath measured the waters?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>). The might of God is especially shown in creation, which Isaiah assumes to be God's work. How infinitely above man must he be, who arranged in such perfection, "by measure and number and weight" (Wisd. 11:20), the earth, the waters, and the heavens, so proportioning each to each as to produce that admirable order and regularity which the intelligent observer cannot but note in the material universe as among its chief characteristics! <span class="cmt_word">In the hollow of his hand</span>. The anthropomorphism is strong, no doubt, but softened by the preceding mention (in ver. 10) of God's "arm," and by the comparison of God to a shepherd (in ver. 11). Isaiah's exalted notion of God renders him fearless with regard to anthropomorphism<span class="cmt_word">. And meted out heaven with the span</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with a span</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>, "My right hand hath <span class="accented">spanned</span> the heavens"). <span class="cmt_word">And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in a tierce</span> (as in the margin). The measure intended is probably the <span class="accented">seah</span>, which was the third part of an <span class="accented">ephah</span>, and held about three gallons. The <span class="accented">seah</span> was "the ordinary measure for household purposes." <span class="cmt_word">In scales... in a balance</span>. The <span class="accented">peles</span>, here translated "scales," is probably the steelyard, while the <span class="accented">mozenaim</span> is "the balance" or "pair of scales" ordinarily used for weighing. God metes out all things with measures, scales, and balances of his own, which are proportioned to his greatness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:12-17 All created beings shrink to nothing in comparison with the Creator. When the Lord, by his Spirit, made the world, none directed his Spirit, or gave advice what to do, or how to do it. The nations, in comparison of him, are as a drop which remains in the bucket, compared with the vast ocean; or as the small dust in the balance, which does not turn it, compared with all the earth. This magnifies God's love to the world, that, though it is of such small account and value with him, yet, for the redemption of it, he gave his only-begotten Son, Joh 3:16. The services of the church can make no addition to him. Our souls must have perished for ever, if the only Son of the Father had not given himself for us.</body></html>
