In some versions (LXX. and Targum) and by some interpreters "Zion<span class= "ital">" </span>is taken as in the objective case, <span class= "ital">O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion; </span>but as the participle, "thou that bringest," is in the feminine, and a female evangeliser other than Jerusalem has not appeared on the scene, the Authorised Version is preferable. In that rendering the ideal Zion, seeing or hearing of the return of the exiles, becomes the bearer of the good news to the other cities of Judah. It is not without emotion that we note the first occurrence of the word which, passing through the Greek of the LXX. and the New Testament (<span class= "greekheb">??????????????</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>has had so fruitful a history, as embodying the message of the Gospel--good-spell, glad tidings--to mankind. The primary meaning of the Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">to make smooth, </span>or bright, and so "to gladden." (Comp. the connection of this English word with the German <span class= "ital">glatten.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">The high mountain.</span>--There is no article in the Hebrew, but the word is probably connected with the ideal exaltation of the holy city, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Behold your God!</span>--The words have, in one sense, only an ideal fulfilment; but the prophet contemplates the return of the exiles and the restoration of the Temple worship, as involving the renewed presence of Jehovah in the sanctuary which He had apparently abandoned. He would come back with His people, and abide with them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - The time of Israel's restoration has drawn nigh. The preparation has been made. The voice calling to preparation is silent. The promises are now on the verge of receiving their accomplishment. It is fitting that some one should announce the fact to the nation. Isaiah calls on the company of prophets living at the time to do so (ver. 9). They are to take up a commanding position, to speak with a loud voice, and to proclaim the good tidings to Zion, to Jerusalem, and to the cities of Judah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>). The terms of the proclamation are then given (vers. 10, 11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Zion, that bringest good tidings</span>, etc.; rather, as in the margin, O <span class="accented">thou that tellest good tidings to Zion</span> (so the LXX., Gesenius, Rosenmuller, Maurer, Hitzig, Knobel, and Kay). <span class="cmt_word">Get thee up into the high mountain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">into a high mountain.</span> Choose an elevated spot from which to make proclamation. <span class="cmt_word">O Jerusalem, that bringest</span>, etc.; again, as in the margin, O <span class="accented">thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem.</span> The repetition, with a slight change, is quite in the manner of Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">The cities of Judah</span>. These would be in rains, no less than Jerusalem herself (see Isaiah 46:26; 64:10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:1-11 All human life is a warfare; the Christian life is the most so; but the struggle will not last always. Troubles are removed in love, when sin is pardoned. In the great atonement of the death of Christ, the mercy of God is exercised to the glory of his justice. In Christ, and his sufferings, true penitents receive of the Lord's hand double for all their sins; for the satisfaction Christ made by his death was of infinite value. The prophet had some reference to the return of the Jews from Babylon. But this is a small event, compared with that pointed out by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament, when John the Baptist proclaimed the approach of Christ. When eastern princes marched through desert countries, ways were prepared for them, and hinderances removed. And may the Lord prepare our hearts by the teaching of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, that high and proud thoughts may be brought down, good desires planted, crooked and rugged tempers made straight and softened, and every hinderance removed, that we may be ready for his will on earth, and prepared for his heavenly kingdom. What are all that belongs to fallen man, or all that he does, but as the grass and the flower thereof! And what will all the titles and possessions of a dying sinner avail, when they leave him under condemnation! The word of the Lord can do that for us, which all flesh cannot. The glad tidings of the coming of Christ were to be sent forth to the ends of the earth. Satan is the strong man armed; but our Lord Jesus is stronger; and he shall proceed, and do all that he purposes. Christ is the good Shepherd; he shows tender care for young converts, weak believers, and those of a sorrowful spirit. By his word he requires no more service, and by his providence he inflicts no more trouble, than he will strengthen them for. May we know our Shepherd's voice, and follow him, proving ourselves his sheep.</body></html>
