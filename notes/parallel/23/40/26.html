he calls them all by their names.">Psalm 147:4</a>). He marshals all that innumerable host of stars, as a supreme general who knows by sight and name every soldier in a vast army, or as a shepherd who knows his flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lift up your eyes</span>, etc. Once more an appeal is made to creation, as proving God's greatness. "Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these (heavens), bringing out their host (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the stars) by number, or in their full number (Cheyne), and calling them all by names" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4, 5</a>, "He telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their names," which, however, is probably later than Isaiah). Omnipotence alone could have created the starry host. Omniscience is required to know their number and their names. The Israelites are supposed to have "learned that the constellations had names, in Babylon" (Cheyne, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>); but a special name for each <span class="accented">star</span>, which the Babylonians did <span class="accented">not</span> give, seems <span class="accented">to</span> be here intended. <span class="cmt_word">Not one faileth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "not one star neglects to attend the muster when God marshals the host." The stars are viewed as his army. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:18-26 Whatever we esteem or love, fear or hope in, more than God, that creature we make equal with God, though we do not make images or worship them. He that is so poor, that he has scarcely a sacrifice to offer, yet will not be without a god of his own. They spared no cost upon their idols; we grudge what is spent in the service of our God. To prove the greatness of God, the prophet appeals to all ages and nations. Those who are ignorant of this, are willingly ignorant. God has the command of all creatures, and of all created things. The prophet directs us to use our reason as well as our senses; to consider who created the hosts of heaven, and to pay our homage to Him. Not one fails to fulfil his will. And let us not forget, that He spake all the promises, and engaged to perform them.</body></html>
