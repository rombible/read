In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm" title="Bless you God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.">Psalm 68:26</a>, the Authorised Version gives "damsels."

"Signs" were of various kinds. They might be actual miracles performed to attest a Divine commission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3-9</a>); or judgments of God, significative of his power and justice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a>); or memorials of something in the past (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9, 16</a>); or pledges of something still future.

These last would only have the effect of signs on those who witnessed their accomplishment. <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>. "A forewarning of a great event" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">A virgin shall conceive.</span> It is questioned whether the word translated "virgin," viz. '<span class="accented">almah</span>, has necessarily that meaning; but it is admitted that the meaning is borne out by every other place in which the word occurs m the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-43.htm">Genesis 24:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-8.htm">Exodus 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-19.htm">Proverbs 30:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-3.htm">Song of Solomon 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>). The LXX., writing two centuries before the birth of Christ, translate by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The rendering "virgin" has the support of the best modern Hebraists, as Lowth, Gesenins, Ewald, Delitzsch, Kay. It is observed with reason that unless '<span class="accented">almah is</span> translated "virgin," there is no announcement made worthy of the grand prelude: "The Lord himself shall give you a sign - Behold!" The Hebrew, however, has not "a virgin," but "the virgin" (and so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), which points to some special virgin, pro-eminent above all others. <span class="cmt_word">And shall call</span>; better than the marginal rendering, <span class="accented">thou shalt call</span>. It was regarded as the privilege of a mother to determine her child's name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-11.htm">Genesis 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6-13, 18-21, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18</a>, etc.), although formally the father gave it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-15.htm">Genesis 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-62.htm">Luke 1:62</a>, 83). <span class="cmt_word">Immanuel</span>.

(The rendering of the Revisers of 1885, "when he knoweth," is less satisfactory.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="accented">- Note on the general purport of the Immanuel prophecy</span>. Few prophecies have been the subject of so much controversy, or called forth such a variety of exegesis, as this prophecy of Immanuel. Rosenm&uuml;ller gives a list of twenty-eight authors who have written dissertations upon it, and himself adds a twenty-ninth. Yet the subject is far from being exhausted. It is still asked: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Were the mother and son persons belonging to the time of Isaiah himself, and if so, what persons? Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Were they the Virgin Mary and her Son Jesus? Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Had the prophecy a double fulfillment, first in certain persons who lived in Isaiah's time, and secondly in Jesus and his mother? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> The first theory is that of the Jewish commentators. Originally, they suggested that the mother was Abi, the wife of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), and the son Hezekiah, who delivered Judah from the Assyrian power (see Justin, 'Dial. cum Tryphon.,' p. 262). But this was early disproved by showing that, according to the numbers of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-2.htm">2 Kings 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), Hezekiah was at least nine years old in the first year of Ahaz, before which this prophecy could not have been delivered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>). The second suggestion made identified the mother with Isaiah's wife, the "prophetess" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a>, and made the son a child of his, called actually Immanuel, or else his son Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>) under a symbolical designation. But <span class="accented">ha-'almah</span>, "the virgin," would be a very strange title for Isaiah to have given his wife, and the rank assigned to Immanuel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> would not suit any son of Isaiah's. It remains to regard the '<span class="accented">almah</span> as "some young woman actually present," name, rank, and position unknown, and Immanuel as her son, also otherwise unknown (Cheyne). But the grand exordium, "The Lord himself shall give you a sign - Behold!" and the rank of Immanuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>), are alike against this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">II.</span> The purely Messianic theory is maintained by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Dr. Kay, but without any consideration of its difficulties. The birth of Christ was an event more than seven hundred years distant. In what sense and to what persons could it be a "sign" of the coming deliverance of the land from Rezin and Pekah? And, upon the purely Messianic theory, what is the meaning of ver. 16? Syria and Samaria were, in fact, crushed within a few years of the delivery of the prophecy. Why is their desolation put off, apparently, till the coming of the Messiah, and even till he has reached a certain age? Mr. Cheyne meets these difficulties by the startling statement that Isaiah expected the advent of the Messiah to synchronize with the Assyrian invasion, and consequently thought that before Rezin and Pekah were crushed he would have reached the age of discernment. But he does not seem to see that in this case the sigma was altogether disappointing and illusory. Time is an essential element of a prophecy which turns upon the word "before" (ver. 16). If this faith of Isaiah's disciples was aroused and their hopes raised by the announcement that Immanuel was just about to be born (Mr. Cheyne translates, "A virgin <span class="accented">is</span> with child"), what would be the revulsion of feeling when no Immanuel appeared? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">III.</span> May not the true account of the matter be that suggested by Bishop Lowth - that the prophecy had a double bearing and a double fulfillment? "The obvious and literal meaning of the prophecy is this," he says: "that within the time that a young woman, now a virgin, should conceive and bring forth a child, and that child should arrive at such an age as to distinguish between good and evil, that is, within a few years, the enemies of Judah should be destroyed." But the prophecy was so worded, he adds, as to have a further meaning, which wan even "the original design and <span class="accented">principal</span> intention of the prophet," viz. the Messianic one. All the expressions of the prophecy do not suit both its intentions - some are selected with reference to the first, others with reference to the second fulfillment - but all suit one or the other, and some suit both. The first child may have received the name Immanuel (comp. Ittiel) from a faithful Jewish mother, who believed that God was with his people, whatever dangers threatened, and may have reached years of discretion about the time that Samaria was carried away captive. The second child is the true "Immanuel," "God with us," the king of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; it is his mother who is pointed at in the expression, "the virgin," and on his account is the grand preamble; through him the people of God, the true Israel, is delivered from its spiritual enemies, sin and Satan - two kings who continually threaten it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-16 Secret disaffection to God is often disguised with the colour of respect to him; and those who are resolved that they will not trust God, yet pretend they will not tempt him. The prophet reproved Ahaz and his court, for the little value they had for Divine revelation. Nothing is more grievous to God than distrust, but the unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of no effect; the Lord himself shall give a sign. How great soever your distress and danger, of you the Messiah is to be born, and you cannot be destroyed while that blessing is in you. It shall be brought to pass in a glorious manner; and the strongest consolations in time of trouble are derived from Christ, our relation to him, our interest in him, our expectations of him and from him. He would grow up like other children, by the use of the diet of those countries; but he would, unlike other children, uniformly refuse the evil and choose the good. And although his birth would be by the power of the Holy Ghost, yet he should not be fed with angels' food. Then follows a sign of the speedy destruction of the princes, now a terror to Judah. Before this child, so it may be read; this child which I have now in my arms, (Shear-jashub, the prophet's own son, ver. 3,) shall be three or four years older, these enemies' forces shall be forsaken of both their kings. The prophecy is so solemn, the sign is so marked, as given by God himself after Ahaz rejected the offer, that it must have raised hopes far beyond what the present occasion suggested. And, if the prospect of the coming of the Divine Saviour was a never-failing support to the hopes of ancient believers, what cause have we to be thankful that the Word was made flesh! May we trust in and love Him, and copy his example.</body></html>
