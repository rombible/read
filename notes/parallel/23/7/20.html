The words find a parallel in the "made him naked" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-19.htm" title="For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.">2Chronicles 28:19</a>. The term "hired" applies to the tribute which Ahaz was about to pay to Tilgath-pilneser. He thought that he was securing an ally: he was but hiring a razor (there is, perhaps, the implied thought that the razor is in other hands than his) that should sweep away all the signs of strength, and leave him an open shame and scorn to all who looked on him. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-4.htm" title="Why Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.">2Samuel 10:4</a>). From head to foot, not sparing even the beard, to maltreat which was the last extreme of Oriental outrage, he and his kingdom should be laid bare and naked to his enemies. Possibly there may be an allusive reference (Kay) to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-9.htm" title="But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.">Leviticus 14:9</a>. The nation, leprous in its guilt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm" title="From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.">Isaiah 1:6</a>), needs the treatment which was prescribed for the leper.<p>(21:22) <span class= "bld">A man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">two ewes. </span>Not only should cultivation cease, but the flocks and herds that had before been counted by hundreds or thousands should be counted now by units, two ewes and a heifer for a man's whole stock, and yet (we note the prophet's irony once more in the use of the word "abundance") even that should be enough for a population reduced in proportion. There should be "milk and honey" for the scattered remnant. They should have that, and nothing but that, to eat, <span class= "ital">ad nauseam usque. </span>The words are grouped together with a grim irony as reminding men of the proverbial words of praise which spoke of Canaan as "a land of milk and honey" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm" title="And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.">Exodus 3:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with the hired razor</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the razor that Ahaz will have hired (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>). The metaphor well expresses the stripping of the land bare by plunder and exaction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1, 12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19-21</a>). God would use Tiglath-Pileser as <span class="accented">his</span> instrument to distress Ahaz. <span class="cmt_word">By them beyond the river</span>; or, <span class="accented">in the parts beyond the river</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-16.htm">1 Chronicles 19:16</a>). "The river" is undoubtedly the Euphrates, and they who dwell beyond it the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_word">By the King of Assyria</span>. Once more a gloss is suspected, as in ver. 17. The meaning would certainly be sufficiently plain without the clause. <span class="cmt_word">The head... the hair of the feet... the beard</span>. These three represent all the hair on any part of the body. Judah is to be completely stripped. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-25 Let those who will not believe the promises of God, expect to hear the alarms of his threatenings; for who can resist or escape his judgments? The Lord shall sweep all away; and whomsoever he employs in any service for him, he will pay. All speaks a sad change of the face of that pleasant land. But what melancholy change is there, which sin will not make with a people? Agriculture would cease. Sorrows of every kind will come upon all who neglect the great salvation. If we remain unfruitful under the means of grace, the Lord will say, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever.</body></html>
