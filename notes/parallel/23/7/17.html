He was bent on calling in the help of the king of Assyria. Isaiah warns him (reserving the name of the king, with all the emphasis of suddenness, for the close of his sentence) that by so doing he is bringing on himself a more formidable invasion than that of Syria and Ephraim, worse than any that had been known since the separation of the two kingdoms (we note the use of the event as a chronological era), than that of Shishak under Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,">2Chronicles 12:2</a>), or Zerah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9</a>), or of Baasha under Asa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1</a>), or of the Moabites and Ammonites under Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.">2Chronicles 20:1</a>), or of the Philistines and Arabians under Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:">2Chronicles 21:16</a>). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/28-19.htm" title="For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.">2Chronicles 28:19-20</a>, we read that "the Lord brought Judah low and made it naked," that "Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, came unto Ahaz and distressed him," and this was but the precursor of the great invasions under Sargon and Sennacherib.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-25.</span> - THE DANGER TO JUDAH FROM ASSYRIA. The perversity of Ahaz, already rebuked in ver. 13, is further punished by a threat, that upon him, and upon his people, and upon his father's house, shall come shortly a dire calamity. The very power whose aid he is himself bent on invoking shall be the scourge to chastise both king and people (vers. 17-20). The land shall be made bare as by a razor (ver. 20). Cultivation shall cease; its scant inhabitants will support themselves by keeping a few cows and sheep (ver. 21), and will nourish themselves on dairy produce, and the honey that the wild bees produce (ver. 22). Briers and thorns will come up everywhere; wild beasts will increase; cattle will browse on the hills that were once carefully cultivated to their summits (vers. 23-25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall bring upon thee</span>, etc. The transition from promises to threatenings is abrupt, and calculated to impress any one who was to any extent impressible. But Ahaz seems not to have had "ears to hear." <span class="cmt_word">From the day that Ephraim departed from Judah</span>; i.e. from the time of the revolt under Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-24</a>) - an evil day, which rankled in the mind of all true Judaeans. <span class="cmt_word">Even the King of Assyria</span>. The construction is awkward, since "the King of Assyria' cannot well stand in apposition with "days." Hence many take the words for a gloss that has been accidentally intruded into the text (Lowth, Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Cheyne). Others, however, see in the grammatical anomaly a grace of composition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-25 Let those who will not believe the promises of God, expect to hear the alarms of his threatenings; for who can resist or escape his judgments? The Lord shall sweep all away; and whomsoever he employs in any service for him, he will pay. All speaks a sad change of the face of that pleasant land. But what melancholy change is there, which sin will not make with a people? Agriculture would cease. Sorrows of every kind will come upon all who neglect the great salvation. If we remain unfruitful under the means of grace, the Lord will say, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever.</body></html>
