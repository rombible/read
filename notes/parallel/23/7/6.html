Tubaal appears in an inscription of Sennacherib as appointed by him as governor of Zidon (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, i.</span> 35). Dr. Kay, connecting the name with Tab-rimmon ("Rimmon is good"), conjectures that the substitution of El ("God") for the name of the Syrian deity may indicate that he was the representative of the family of Naaman, and, like him, a proselyte to the faith of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make a breach therein</span>.

"Tab-ill" appears to be a Syrian name, founded upon the same pattern as Tab-rimmon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), rite one meaning "God is good, "the other "Rimmon is good." We cannot, however, conclude from the name that the family of Tabeal was monotheistic (Kay), for El was one of the many Syrian gods as much as Rimmon (see Max Mailer, 'Science of Religion,' pp. 177, 178). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 Ungodly men are often punished by others as bad as themselves. Being in great distress and confusion, the Jews gave up all for lost. They had made God their enemy, and knew not how to make him their friend. The prophet must teach them to despise their enemies, in faith and dependence on God. Ahaz, in fear, called them two powerful princes. No, says the prophet, they are but tails of smoking firebrands, burnt out already. The two kingdoms of Syria and Israel were nearly expiring. While God has work for the firebrands of the earth, they consume all before them; but when their work is fulfilled, they will be extinguished in smoke. That which Ahaz thought most formidable, is made the ground of their defeat; because they have taken evil counsel against thee; which is an offence to God. God scorns the scorners, and gives his word that the attempt should not succeed. Man purposes, but God disposes. It was folly for those to be trying to ruin their neighbours, who were themselves near to ruin. Isaiah must urge the Jews to rely on the assurances given them. Faith is absolutely necessary to quiet and compose the mind in trials.</body></html>
