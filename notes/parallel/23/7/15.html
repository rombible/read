(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.">Isaiah 7:22</a>.) Fields and vineyards should be left uncultivated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-9.htm" title="In my ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.">Isaiah 5:9</a>), and instead of bread and meat, and wine and oil, the people, flying from their cities and taking refuge in caves and mountains, should be left to the food of a nomadic tribe, such, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as the Kenites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-25.htm" title="He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.">Judges 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-26.htm" title="And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.">1Samuel 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>). The "butter" of the Bible here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-25.htm" title="He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.">Judges 5:25</a>, is the clotted milk which has always been a delicacy with Arabs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-16 Secret disaffection to God is often disguised with the colour of respect to him; and those who are resolved that they will not trust God, yet pretend they will not tempt him. The prophet reproved Ahaz and his court, for the little value they had for Divine revelation. Nothing is more grievous to God than distrust, but the unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of no effect; the Lord himself shall give a sign. How great soever your distress and danger, of you the Messiah is to be born, and you cannot be destroyed while that blessing is in you. It shall be brought to pass in a glorious manner; and the strongest consolations in time of trouble are derived from Christ, our relation to him, our interest in him, our expectations of him and from him. He would grow up like other children, by the use of the diet of those countries; but he would, unlike other children, uniformly refuse the evil and choose the good. And although his birth would be by the power of the Holy Ghost, yet he should not be fed with angels' food. Then follows a sign of the speedy destruction of the princes, now a terror to Judah. Before this child, so it may be read; this child which I have now in my arms, (Shear-jashub, the prophet's own son, ver. 3,) shall be three or four years older, these enemies' forces shall be forsaken of both their kings. The prophecy is so solemn, the sign is so marked, as given by God himself after Ahaz rejected the offer, that it must have raised hopes far beyond what the present occasion suggested. And, if the prospect of the coming of the Divine Saviour was a never-failing support to the hopes of ancient believers, what cause have we to be thankful that the Word was made flesh! May we trust in and love Him, and copy his example.</body></html>
