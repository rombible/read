he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>, and are therefore worth noting as bearing on the date of that book. There, however, the sum represents the annual produce of the vineyard, here the rent of the vines at a shekel each, a high rent apparently, and indicating a choice quality of vine. The costly vineyards of the hills of Judah should be left to run wild without a keeper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-10.htm" title="Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.">Isaiah 5:10</a>), and thorns and briers would rapidly cover it. "Silverling" was an old English word for any silver coin, and appears in Tyndale's version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>, and Coverdale's of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Judges 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm" title="And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give you every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.">Judges 16:5</a>; here it stands for "shekel." The modern rent is said to be a piastre (2�d.) for each vine; the shekel was worth 2s. 3 d. (Kay).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A thousand vines at a thousand silverlings</span>. By "silverlings" our translators mean "pieces of silver," probably shekels. "A thousand vines at a thousand shekels" may mean either a thousand vines worth that amount, or a thousand vines rented at that sum annually (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>). The latter would point to vineyards of unusual goodness, since the shekel is <span class="accented">at least</span> eighteen pence, and the present rent of a vineyard in Palestine is at the rate of a piastre for each vine, or 2&frac12;d. The general meaning would seem to be that not even the best vineyards would be cultivated, but would lie waste, and grow only "briers and thorns." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-25 Let those who will not believe the promises of God, expect to hear the alarms of his threatenings; for who can resist or escape his judgments? The Lord shall sweep all away; and whomsoever he employs in any service for him, he will pay. All speaks a sad change of the face of that pleasant land. But what melancholy change is there, which sin will not make with a people? Agriculture would cease. Sorrows of every kind will come upon all who neglect the great salvation. If we remain unfruitful under the means of grace, the Lord will say, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever.</body></html>
