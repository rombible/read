He finds him halting between two opinions. He is making a show of resistance, but in reality he is not depending either on the protection of Jehovah, or the courage of his people, but on a plan of his own. Why should he not continue to pay tribute to Assyria, as Uzziah and Menahem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a>) had done, and write to Tiglath-pileser to attack the territories of the invading kings, as he actually did at a later stage in the war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>)?<p><span class= "bld">Thou and Shear-jashub thy son.</span>--Assuming Isaiah 6 to give the first revelation of the idea of the "remnant," it would follow that the birth of the son whose name (<span class= "ital">Remnant returns</span>--the return being both literal and spiritual--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"is converted"), embodied a prophecy, must have followed on that revelation, and he was probably, therefore, at the time a stripling of sixteen or eighteen. It may be noted that Isaiah had in the history of Hosea 1, 2 the example of a prophet who, as his children were born, gave them names which were terribly or hopefully significant. Each child was, as it were, a sign and portent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-18.htm" title="Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwells in mount Zion.">Isaiah 8:18</a>). The fact that the mother of his children was herself a prophetess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-3.htm" title="And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:3</a>), sharing his hopes and fears, gives a yet deeper interest to the fact.<p><span class= "bld">At the end of the conduit . . .</span>--The king was apparently superintending the defensive operations of the siege, probably cutting off the supply of water outside the walls, as Hezekiah afterwards did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/32-3.htm" title="He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.">2Chronicles 32:3-4</a>). The "upper pool" has been identified with the Upper Gihon pool (<span class= "ital">Birket-el-Mamilla</span>) or the "dragon's well" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-13.htm" title="And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.">Nehemiah 2:13</a>. A lower pool meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-9.htm" title="You have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.">Isaiah 22:9</a>. The "fuller's field" was near En-rogelim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm" title="And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a great army.

The name Shear-Jashub, "a remnant shall return," may have been given to Isaiah's son by revelation, as Ewald thinks it was; or Isaiah may have given it to testify his faith both in the threats and in the promises of which he had been made the mouth-piece. The command to take him with him on the present occasion was probably given on account of his name, that the attention of Ahaz might be called to it. <span class="cmt_word">The conduit of the upper pool</span> is mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>. It was probably a subterranean duct which brought water into the city from the high ground outside the Damascus gate. Ahaz may have visited it in order to see that it was made available for his own use, but not for the enemy's (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3, 4, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9, 11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 Ungodly men are often punished by others as bad as themselves. Being in great distress and confusion, the Jews gave up all for lost. They had made God their enemy, and knew not how to make him their friend. The prophet must teach them to despise their enemies, in faith and dependence on God. Ahaz, in fear, called them two powerful princes. No, says the prophet, they are but tails of smoking firebrands, burnt out already. The two kingdoms of Syria and Israel were nearly expiring. While God has work for the firebrands of the earth, they consume all before them; but when their work is fulfilled, they will be extinguished in smoke. That which Ahaz thought most formidable, is made the ground of their defeat; because they have taken evil counsel against thee; which is an offence to God. God scorns the scorners, and gives his word that the attempt should not succeed. Man purposes, but God disposes. It was folly for those to be trying to ruin their neighbours, who were themselves near to ruin. Isaiah must urge the Jews to rely on the assurances given them. Faith is absolutely necessary to quiet and compose the mind in trials.</body></html>
