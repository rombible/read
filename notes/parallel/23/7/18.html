The mention of Egypt indicates that some of the king's counsellors were then, as afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm" title="That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!">Isaiah 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>), planning an Egyptian alliance, as others were relying on that with Assyria. The prophet tells them that each is fraught with danger. No help and much evil would come from such plans. Consistent in his policy from first to last, the one counsel he gives is that men should practise righteousness, and wait upon the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">The uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt.</span>--The phrase points to the whole extent of the Delta of the Nile, probably to the whole Egyptian course of the Nile itself. Historically the prophecy found its fulfilment in the invasion of Pharaoh Necho in the reign of Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>), or, nearer Isaiah's time, in the movements of Tirhakah's arms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2Kings 19:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall hiss</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>, and note <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt</span>. The "fly of Egypt," like the "bee of Assyria," represents the military force of the nation, which God summons to take part in the coming affliction of Judaea. The prophetic glance may be extended over the entire period of Judah's decadence, and the "<span class="accented">flies"</span> summoned may include those which clustered about Neco at Megiddo, and carried off Jehoahaz from Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-34</a>). There may be allusion also to Egyptian ravages in the reigns of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esar-haddon. In any general review of the period we shall find it stated that, from the time of Sargon to that of Cyrus, Judaea was the battle-ground upon which the forces of Assyria (or Assyro-Babylonia) and Egypt contended for the empire of western Asia. The desolation of the land during this period was produced almost as much by the Egyptian "<span class="accented">fly</span> as by the Assyrian <span class="accented">bee</span>." The "rivers of Egypt" are the Nile, its branches, and perhaps the great canals by which its waters were distributed. <span class="cmt_word">The bee that is in the land of Assyria</span>. The choice of the terms "<span class="accented">bee"</span> and "<span class="accented">fly</span>," to represent respectively the hosts of Assyria and Egypt, is not without significance. Egyptian armies were swarms, hastily levied, and very imperfectly disciplined. <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> were bodies of trained troops accustomed to war, and almost as well disciplined as the Romans. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-25 Let those who will not believe the promises of God, expect to hear the alarms of his threatenings; for who can resist or escape his judgments? The Lord shall sweep all away; and whomsoever he employs in any service for him, he will pay. All speaks a sad change of the face of that pleasant land. But what melancholy change is there, which sin will not make with a people? Agriculture would cease. Sorrows of every kind will come upon all who neglect the great salvation. If we remain unfruitful under the means of grace, the Lord will say, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever.</body></html>
