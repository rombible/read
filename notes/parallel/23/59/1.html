The passage has many analogies with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-23</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord's hand is not shortened;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God is not less able to help than of old; his "hand" has lost none of its power. That he does not help is owing to the iniquities of his people, which have separated between him and them (ver. 2). It is the same fact which has made his ear heavy. He cannot hear prayers that are not sincere - not from the heart. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/59.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>59:1-8 If our prayers are not answered, and the salvation we wait for is not wrought for us, it is not because God is weary of hearing prayer, but because we are weary of praying. See here sin in true colours, exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences, exceedingly hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, not only from all good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their own destruction, on infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill or craft, in devising schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver or save them. No schemes of self-wrought salvation shall avail those who despise the Redeemer's robe of righteousness. Every man who is destitute of the Spirit of Christ, runs swiftly to evil of some sort; but those regardless of Divine truth and justice, are strangers to peace.</body></html>
