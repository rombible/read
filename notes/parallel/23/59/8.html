There is no judgment in their goings; rather, <span class="accented">no justice -</span> no recognition of other men's rights, no endeavour to observe right in their own acts and proceedings (comp. ver. 4; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 21, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>, etc<span class="cmt_word">.). They have made them crooked paths</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-6.htm">Proverbs 28:6</a>). The way that leadeth to life is straight. They have wandered from it, and made for themselves "crooked" paths, which can only lead to destruction. In such paths there neither is nor can be "peace." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/59.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>59:1-8 If our prayers are not answered, and the salvation we wait for is not wrought for us, it is not because God is weary of hearing prayer, but because we are weary of praying. See here sin in true colours, exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences, exceedingly hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, not only from all good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their own destruction, on infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill or craft, in devising schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver or save them. No schemes of self-wrought salvation shall avail those who despise the Redeemer's robe of righteousness. Every man who is destitute of the Spirit of Christ, runs swiftly to evil of some sort; but those regardless of Divine truth and justice, are strangers to peace.</body></html>
