The new covenant is to involve the gift of the Spirit, that writes the law of God inwardly in the heart, as distinct from the Law, which is thought of as outside the conscience, doing its work as an accuser and a judge.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/59.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and I.</span> The prophet begins with one construction, and then checks himself, and introduces another. <span class="cmt_word">This is my covenant</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; and see the comment on Isaiah 53:3). The new covenant involved the giving of God's Spirit to his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>); and this Spirit, it is here promised, shall not depart from God's people while time endures.

It is generally thought to describe the coming of the Messiah, as the Avenger and Deliverer of his church. There was none to intercede with God to turn away his wrath; none to interpose for the support of justice and truth. Yet He engaged his own strength and righteousness for his people. God will make his justice upon the enemies of his church and people plainly appear. When the enemy threatens to bear down all without control, then the Spirit of the Lord shall stop him, put him to flight. He that has delivered, will still deliver. A far more glorious salvation is promised to be wrought out by the Messiah in the fulness of time, which all the prophets had in view. The Son of God shall come to us to be our Redeemer; the Spirit of God shall come to be our Sanctifier: thus the Comforter shall abide with the church for ever, Joh 14:16. The word of Christ will always continue in the mouths of the faithful; and whatever is pretended to be the mind of the Spirit, must be tried by the Scriptures. We must lament the progress of infidelity and impiety. But the cause of the Redeemer shall gain a complete victory even on earth, and the believer will be more than conqueror when the Lord receives him to his glory in heaven.</body></html>
