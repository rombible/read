Possibly, however, the "one king" may stand for one dynasty.<p><span class= "bld">Shall Tyre sing as an harlot.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">there shall be to Tyre as the song of the harlot, </span>possibly referring to some well-known lyric of this type. The commercial city, welcoming foreigners of all nations as her lovers for the sake of gain, is compared to the prostitute who sells herself for money. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - TYRE'S RESTORATION TO PROSPERITY AND CONVERSION TO JEHOVAH. After an interval, expressed by the symbolic number of" <span class="accented">seventy</span> years," Tyre is to rise from her ashes, and become once more a prosperous state, resuming her former occupation of a "merchant city," and once more making great gains, which she will devote to the service of Jehovah. St. Jerome thought that this prophecy had not been accomplished in his day. If so, it cannot be said to have been accomplished yet; unless, indeed, Tyre may be regarded as representing the commercial spirit, which. under Christianity, is not necessarily alien from religion, but shows itself sometimes altogether friendly to the Church, supplying ways and means for ten thousand philanthropic and praiseworthy enterprises (ver. 18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tyro shall be forgotten</span>; i.e. "shall cease to occupy men's thoughts, as a factor in politics - shall pass out of their calculations, and count for nothing." <span class="cmt_word">Seventy years</span>. "Forty years" and "seventy years" are the chief representatives in Scripture of an indefinite time. The week of creation seems to have given to seven its quasi-sacred character, which passed from the primary number to the corresponding decimal one. The sacred use of "seventy" appears first in the "seventy elders" who accompanied Moses to the covenant-feast on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>). After this, "seventy 'talents are mentioned as the weight of the bronze offerings for the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-29.htm">Exodus 38:29</a>), and "seventy" shekels as the weight of the silver bowls offered by the heads of tribes when the tabernacle was set up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13-85</a>). The "indefinite" us, of "seventy" is most apparent in such expressions as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>, "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, surely Lamech <span class="accented">seventy</span> and sevenfold;" and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>, "I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until <span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven." "Seventy" seems also to be indefinite in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-9.htm">Numbers 33:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-13.htm">Judges 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-14.htm">1 Chronicles 21:14</a>, etc. It is absurd to count the "seventy years" of the present passage, as some do, from the accession of Nebuchadnezzar to the death of Nabonidus, for neither did Tyro begin to be forgotten in the first year of the one prince, nor did she immediately recover herself on the death of the other. <span class="cmt_word">According to the days of one king</span>; or, <span class="accented">like the days of one king</span>. The period, whatever its length, should be to Type "like the days of one king;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unchanging, without hope. Oriental kings prided themselves on maintaining an unaltered policy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall Tyre sing as an harlot</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it shall be to Tyre as</span> [<span class="accented">in</span>] <span class="accented">the song of the harlot</span>. <span class="accented">A</span> particular song seems to be meant, part of which the prophet proceeds to quote in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-18 The desolations of Tyre were not to be for ever. The Lord will visit Tyre in mercy. But when set at liberty, she will use her old arts of temptation. The love of worldly wealth is spiritual idolatry; and covetousness is spiritual idolatry. This directs those that have wealth, to use it in the service of God. When we abide with God in our worldly callings, when we do all in our power to further the gospel, then our merchandise and hire are holiness to the Lord, if we look to his glory. Christians should carry on business as God's servants, and use riches as his stewards.</body></html>
