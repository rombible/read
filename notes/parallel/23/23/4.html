Zidon, the most ancient and venerable of the Phoenician cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; Justin, 18:3, etc.), is called upon to feel shame because Tyre is captured. The ruin of the metropolitan city would be felt as a disgrace by all the lesser towns, and by Zidon especially. <span class="cmt_word">The sea... even the strength of the sea</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the stronghold of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Tyre herself. Tyre declares that she is childless, has neither son nor daughter, is as if she had never travailed nor brought forth children. <span class="cmt_word">I travail not</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">I have not travailed</span>, <span class="accented">nor brought forth</span>, <span class="accented">nor nourished</span> up, etc. My children being dead or taken from me, it is as if I had never borne them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-14 Tyre was the mart of the nations. She was noted for mirth and diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself shall be abased. God will do it, who has all power in his hand; but the Chaldeans shall be the instruments.</body></html>
