The Assyrian inscriptions record the conquests referred to. Sargon relates his victory over the "perverse and rebellious Chaldaeans," who had rebelled under Merodach-baladan (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vii. 41, 45). Towns were pillaged, 80,570 men carried away captive from a single city. Sennacherib (<span class= "ital">ibid., </span>p. 59) boasts of having plundered Babylon itself, and all the "strong cities and castles of the land of the Chaldaeans"; and again, of having crushed another revolt under Suzab the Babylonian (<span class= "ital">ibid., </span>i. 47-49). The words that follow on this survey are better rendered: <span class= "ital">This people is no more: Asshur appointeth it for the desert beasts. They set up their towers, they destroy its palaces. </span>The "towers are those of the Assyrian besiegers attacking Babylon; the palaces, those of the attacked. The words have, however, often been interpreted as pointing to the origin and migration of the Chaldaeans, as having had scarcely any national existence till Assyria had brought them into the plains of the Euphrates. The English version seems based upon this interpretation of the passage. It is obvious, however, that such a fragment of ethnological history does not cohere well with the context, and gives a less satisfactory meaning. It is doubtful, too, whether the supposed history itself rests on any adequate evidence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold the land of the Chaldeans</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-14.htm">Isaiah 48:14, 20</a>). Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Isaiah knows the people as Chahleans (Kasdim), the capital as Babylon. Kaldi, in the inscriptions, is a rare word, and the name of a not very important tribe. Yet Berosus uses the term to designate the whole nation. <span class="cmt_word">This people was not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "is no more a people" - "has ceased to exist." Sargon conquered Babylon in <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, and made himself king, ruling it, together with Assyria, until <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, when it rebelled and recovered its independence. Sennacherib reconquered it in <span class="date">B.C. 704</span>, and again in <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, when he made his eldest son viceroy. Esarhaddon ruled over both countries, as did Asshur-bani-pal. Though later (about <span class="date">B.C. 620-610</span>) Babylon reasserted her independence, and became a great empire, yet Isaiah was justified, at almost any period of his life after <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, in speaking of her as non-existent. <span class="cmt_word">Till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness</span>. There is no "till" in the original. The clause is separate and independent, not connected grammatically with the preceding. Nor does it assert that the Assyrians "founded" Babylon for any one, but only that they "established" it, or "appointed" it to be a habitation for "the <span class="accented">beasts of the desert"</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:39, etc.). The prophet views the Assyrians as intending to reduce Babylon to ruins, and leave it waste and uninhabited. <span class="cmt_word">The towers thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the siege-towers requisite for reducing so strong a city. <span class="cmt_word">They raised up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they made bare</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He brought it to ruin</span>. "He" is "the Assyrian." The case of Babylon is adduced to increase the alarm of Tyro, by reminding the inhabitants of what the Assyrians had done to a town greater and stronger than their own. The allusion is probably to certain severities of Sargon's in <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, which, however, are rhetorically exaggerated. It was never the policy of the Assyrians to depopulate or destroy Babylon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-14 Tyre was the mart of the nations. She was noted for mirth and diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself shall be abased. God will do it, who has all power in his hand; but the Chaldeans shall be the instruments.</body></html>
