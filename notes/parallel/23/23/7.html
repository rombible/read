Herodotus was told (about <span class="date">B.C. 450</span>) that its temple of Hercules (Melkarth) had been built two thousand three hundred years previously (Herod., 2:44). Q. Curtius makes the city to have been founded by Agenor, the father of Cadmus, who was supposed to have lived three hundred years before the Trojan War ('Vit. Alex.,' 4:4). It must be noted, however, on the other hand, that there is no mention at all of <span class="accented">Tyro</span> in Homer, and none in Scripture until the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>), about <span class="date">B.C. 1300</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn</span> (so Lowth, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius, Ewald, Kay). Others render the passage, "whose feet were wont to carry her afar off to sojourn." In the one case the coming flight and exile, in the other the past commercial enterprise of the city, is pointed at. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-14 Tyre was the mart of the nations. She was noted for mirth and diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself shall be abased. God will do it, who has all power in his hand; but the Chaldeans shall be the instruments.</body></html>
