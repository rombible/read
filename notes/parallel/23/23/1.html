These we learn, partly from Scripture itself, partly from Assyrian inscriptions. In the days of David and Solomon there had been an intimate alliance between Israel and Hiram, King of Tyre. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm" title="And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor.">Psalm 45:12</a> indicates at least the interchange of kingly gifts, if not the acknowledgment of sovereignty by payment of tribute. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7</a>, which we have some reason to connect with the reign of Uzziah, shows that this alliance had passed into hostility. The position of Tyre naturally threw it into more intimate relations with the northern kingdom; "its country was nourished by the king's country" then as in the days of Herod Agrippa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>), and there seems reason to believe that the son of Tabeal, whom Pekah and Rezin intended to place upon the throne of Judah, was the son of a Tyrian ruler. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm" title="Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the middle of it, even the son of Tabeal:">Isaiah 7:6</a>.) It was, at this time, the most flourishing of the Ph?nician cities, and had succeeded to the older fame of Zidon. The action of Ahaz in inviting the help of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and the Syrians had tended to make Tyre also an object of attack by the Assyrian armies. The prophecy now before us would seem to have been connected with that attack, and foretells the issue of the conflict on which Tyre had rashly entered. Upon that issue light is thrown by the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings. Sargon records that he "plundered the district of Samaria and the whole house of Omri," and "reigned from Yatnan (Cyprus), which is in the midst of the sea of the setting sun <span class= "bld">. . .</span> from the great Ph?nicia and Syria<span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "bld">. </span>to all the cities of remote Media" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 27). Sennacherib boasts of a victory over the land of the Hatti (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Hittites); "fear overwhelmed Luti, the king of Zidon," and "he fled to Yatnan, which is in the midst of the sea," and the Assyrian "placed Tubalu" (the Tabeal of Isaiah) on the throne of the kingdom (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 61). In anticipation of these events, the prophet utters his note of warning to the great merchant city. It seems more natural to connect it with those events, which came within the horizon of his vision, than to refer it, as some interpreters have done, to the later siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar. The mention of the Chaldeans as having been subdued by the Assyrians, which fits in with Sargon's and Sennacherib's victories over Merodach-baladan (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 45, 59), who endeavoured to establish an independent kingdom in Babylon (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a>), and is, of course, entirely inapplicable to the time of Nebuchadnezzar, seems, indeed, to be decisive as to this question.<p><span class= "bld">Howl, ye ships of Tarshish . . .</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-16.htm" title="And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasant pictures.">Isaiah 2:16</a>. The prophet sees, as in vision, the argosies of Tyre speeding on their way homeward across the Mediterranean from Tarshish (Spain), and bids them raise their lamentation over the coming fate of their city. They will hear that their city has been taken, that there is no access to its harbours. At Chittim (Cyprus, or, probably, Citium, the chief Ph?nician colony of the island), the tidings which burst upon them were as a revelation, confirming the vague rumours they had heard before.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - THE BURDEN OF TYRE. We here reach the last of the "burdens" - the concluding chapter of the series of denunciatory prophecies which commenced with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. It is an elegy "in three stanzas, or strophes" (Cheyne) - the first extending from ver. 1 to ver. 5; the second, thence to ver. 9; and the third from ver. 10 to ver. 14. An undertone of sadness, and even of commiseration, prevails throughout it, the prophet viewing Tyre as a fellow-sufferer with Israel, persecuted and oppressed by the fame enemy, Assyria, which was everywhere pushing her conquests, and had recently extended her dominion even over Babylon (ver. 13). This last allusion fixes the date of the prophecy to a time subsequent to <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, when the Assyrian monarch, Sargon, first conquered the country, and took the title of king (G. Smith, 'Epanym Canon,' p. 86). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, 31). The expression is common in the prophets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>, etc.: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-2.htm">Ezekiel 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-5.htm">Joel 1:5, 11, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye ships of Tarshish</span>. "Ships of Tarshish" are first mentioned in connection with the trade carried on by Solomon. Apparently, the term there designates a certain class of ship rather than those engaged in a particular trade (see the comment on 1 Kings 22:48 in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 2. p. 623). Here, however, Phoenician ships, actually engaged in the trade with Tartessus, may be intended. Tartessus was a very ancient Phoenician settlement in the south of Spain, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and was the center of a most important and lucrative commerce (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; Herod., i. 163; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, etc.). In the present passage the returning fleet of merchantmen is addressed, and told that the harbour to which they are hastening is closed, the city desolate. <span class="cmt_word">From the land of Chittim</span>. "Chittim" here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>, and elsewhere <span class="accented">generally</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> probably Cyprus, whose most ancient capital was called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Kitten</span> (see Joseph, 'Ant. Jud,' 1:6, &sect; 1). The name "Chittim" is not improbably a variant of "Khittim," "the Hittites," who may have been the first to colonize the island. A fleet from the Western Mediterranean would naturally touch at Cyprus on its way to Tyro, and would there learn the calamity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-14 Tyre was the mart of the nations. She was noted for mirth and diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself shall be abased. God will do it, who has all power in his hand; but the Chaldeans shall be the instruments.</body></html>
