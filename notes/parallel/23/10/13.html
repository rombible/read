(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/37-10.htm" title="Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 37:10-13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I have removed the bounds of the people.</span>--The practice has, of course, more or less characterised the conquerors of all ages in their attempts to merge independent nationalities into one great empire; but it was pursued more systematically by Assyria than by most others. To be "a remover of boundaries and landmarks "was the title in which an Assyrian king most exulted. (Comp. inscription of Rimmon-nirari, in Smith's <span class= "ital">Assyrian Discoveries, </span>pp. 243, 244. <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> 3).<p><span class= "bld">I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I have put down those that sat firmly. </span>The Hebrew word for "valiant man" means primarily a "bull," and then figuratively, as in Isa xxxiv, 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>, a "mighty one." The fact that the bull appears so frequently in Assyrian monuments as a symbol of sovereignty, mates it probable that the word is used in that symbolic sense here. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm" title="Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.">Psalm 78:25</a>, the "mighty ones" to whom it is applied are those of the host of heaven, the angels of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he saith</span>. Neither this speech nor that in vers. 8-11, nor again that given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24, 25</a>, is to be regarded as historical in the sense of being the actual utterance of any Assyrian monarch. All are imaginary, speeches, composed by the prophet, whereby he expresses in his own language the thoughts which Assyrian kings entertained in their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">I have removed the bounds of the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of peoples</span>. Assyrian monarchs take as one of their titles "the remover of boundaries and landmarks" (G. Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' pp. 243, 244). <span class="cmt_word">And have robbed their treasures</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>). The plunder of conquered countries is constantly recorded by the Assyrian monarchs as one of the most important results of each successful expedition. It is not infrequently represented in the sculptures (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 85). <span class="cmt_word">I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</span> The passage is obscure; and many different renderings have been given. Perhaps the best is that of Mr. Cheyne, "I have brought down, like a mighty one, those that sat on thrones." <span class="accented">Abbir</span>, however, the word translated "a mighty one," as often means "a bull" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-13.htm">Psalm 50:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-19 See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?</body></html>
