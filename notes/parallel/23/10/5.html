Assyria had been named in connection with the Syro-Ephraim alliance against Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/7-17.htm" title="The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:17-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>); but this is the first prophetic utterance of which it is the direct subject. Anticipating the phraseology of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>, we might call it the "burden of Assyria." In the judgment of the best Assyrian scholars, some years had passed since the date of the alliance and invasion. Tiglath ? pileser had taken Damascus and reduced Samaria to submission. Pekah and Ahaz had met at Damascus to do homage to their common suzerain. In B.C. 727 Salmaneser succeeded to the throne of Assyria, and began the conquest of Samaria and the deportation of the Ten Tribes in B.C. 722 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/17-3.htm" title="Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.">2Kings 17:3-6</a>). On his death, in B.C. 721, the throne was seized by Sargon, who had been his Tartan, or commander-in-chief (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>). The achievements of this king are recorded at length in an inscription discovered by M. Botta at Khorsabad (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 28. Lenormant's <span class= "ital">Manual, </span>1 p. 392). In it he says:--"I besieged, took, and occupied the city of Samaria, and carried into captivity 27,280 of its inhabitants. I changed the form of government of the country, and placed over it lieutenants of my own." In another inscription discovered at Kouyunyik, but unfortunately incomplete, Sargon speaks of himself as "the conqueror of the far-off land of Judah" (Layard, <span class= "ital">Inscriptions, </span>33:8). It was probably to this king, exulting in his triumphs and threatening an attack on Judah, and not (as was commonly thought prior to the discovery of the inscription) to his son Sennacherib, who succeeded him B.C. 704, that the prophet now addressed himself. The first words proclaim that the great king was but an instrument working out the Divine intent, the "rod," and the "staff," the "axe" and the "saw" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm" title="Shall the ax boast itself against him that hews therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shakes it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.">Isaiah 10:15</a>). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>, the earlier king of Assyria is as "the razor that is hired." So Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm" title="You are my battle ax and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;">Jeremiah 51:20</a> is the "battle-axe" or "hammer" of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm" title="Have you not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste defended cities into ruinous heaps.">Isaiah 37:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-19.</span> - ASSYRIA, AFTER BEING GOD'S INSTRUMENT TO PUNISH ISRAEL, SHALL HERSELF BE PUNISHED IN HER TURN. The wicked are a sword in the hand of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>), wherewith he executes his judgments; but this fact is hid from them, and they imagine that they are successful through their own strength and might. So it was with Assyria (vers. 5-14), which its long career of victory had made proud and arrogant above measure. God now, by the mouth of Isaiah, makes known his intention of bringing down the pride of Assyria, and laying her glory in the dust, by a sudden and great destruction (vers. 15:19), after she has served his purposes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Assyrian</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Ho! Asshur</span>. "Asshur" is the nation personified, and is here addressed as an individual. The transition from vers. 1-4 is abrupt, and may be taken to indicate an accidental juxtaposition of two entirely distinct prophecies. Or Assyria may be supposed to have been in the prophet's thought, though not in his words, when he spoke of "prisoners" and "slain" in the first clause of ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of mine anger</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>, where it is said of Babylon, "Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war; for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy the kingdoms"). So Assyria was now the "rod" wherewith God chastised his enemies. The true "staff" in the hand of Assyria, wherewith she smote the peoples, was "God's indignation." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-19 See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?</body></html>
