The formula with which the section opens reminds us of that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm" title="Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the middle of the earth!">Isaiah 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm" title="Woe to them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!">Isaiah 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-18.htm" title="Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:">Isaiah 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm" title="Woe to them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:">Isaiah 5:22</a>, and suggests the thought that the prophet is speaking not only or chiefly of the northern kingdom, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-21.htm" title="Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:21</a>, but of Israel as including Judah. The evils the prophet denounces are, it will be noted, identical with those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm" title="Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm" title="Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!">Isaiah 5:23</a>. For the second clause of the verse, read, "<span class= "ital">and the scribes who register oppression." </span>All the formalities of justice were observed punctiliously. The decision of the unjust judge was duly given and recorded, but the outcome of it all was that the poor, the widow, and the fatherless got no redress. The words for "prey" and "rob" are those used in the mysterious name of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said to me, Take you a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:1</a>. They occur again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm" title="I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.">Isaiah 10:6</a>. It would seem as if the prophet sought in this way to impress the thought of the great law of divine retribution. Men were reaping as they had sown.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - The prophecy begun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a> terminates with this stanza, which contains a warning against injustice and oppression, addressed to Israel and Judah equally, and accompanied by the threat of a "day of desolation," when those who have refused to make God their Refuge will have no resource, but to go into captivity with the "prisoners," or to perish with the "slain." A foreign conquest, accompanied by slaughter, and the deportation of captives, is not obscurely intimated. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 20, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, etc.).

The decrees of courts were, it is clear, carefully engrossed by the officials, probably upon parchment, every outward formality being observed, while justice itself was set at naught. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-4 These verses are to be joined with the foregoing chapter.
