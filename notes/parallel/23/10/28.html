That such an invasion took place at or about the time of that king's attack on Ashdod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>) the inscriptions leave no doubt. The Koujunyik cylinder names the king of Judah as having joined with the king of Ashdod; and in another, Sargon speaks of himself as "the subduer of the lands of Judah" (Layard, <span class= "ital">Inscriptions, </span>xxxiii. 8). There is nothing in the passage itself to determine whether <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:">Isaiah 10:28-32</a> are predictive or historical, or when they were first uttered. Assuming that the Messianic prophecy of chap 11 is in close connection with them, it seems most probable that now, as in the earlier attack of Pekah and Rezin (Isaiah 7), as in the later invasion of Sennacherib (Isaiah 37), the bright vision of the future came to sustain the people when they were at their lowest point of depression. This would obviously be when Sargon's armies were actually encamped round the city, when they had reached the last halting-place of the itinerary which Isaiah traces out. We may infer accordingly that the Assyrian armies were then at or near Nob, and that the prophet, supplied, either by human agency or supernaturally, with a knowledge of the movements of the Assyrian armies, describes their progress to a terrified and expectant people, and fixes the final goal. That progress we now have to trace. (1) Aiath is probably identical with the Ai of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.">Joshua 7:2</a>, the Aija of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-31.htm" title="The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelled at Michmash, and Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from Bethel. (2) Migron. The route taken was not the usual one, but passed over three valleys, probably with a view to surprise Jerusalem by an unexpected attack. The modern name, <span class= "ital">Bure Magrun, </span>survives, a short distance from Bethel. (3) Michmash. Now <span class= "ital">Muchmas, </span>on the east side of the Migron valley. Here the carriages, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">baggage </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-15.htm" title="And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-22.htm" title="And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.">1Samuel 17:22</a>), the <span class= "ital">impedimenta, </span>of the Assyrian army was left behind that the host might advance with greater rapidity to immediate action. (4) Geba, in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-60.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs. All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities.">1Chronicles 6:60</a>). Here, after defiling through the "passages," probably the gorge of <span class= "ital">Wady Suweinit </span>memorable for Jonathan s adventure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1Samuel 14:4-5</a>), the army halted and encamped. (5) The panic spread rapidly to Ramah, memorable as the chief residence of Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm" title="And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:17</a>). (6) The inhabitants of Gibeah, still retaining in its name its old association with the hero-king of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm" title="Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.">1Samuel 11:4</a>), left their town deserted and undefended. (7) Gallim, not now identifiable, but mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a>. (8) Laieh, not the northern city of that name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-29.htm" title="And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.">Judges 18:29</a>), but near Jerusalem. Read, <span class= "ital">Listen, O Laish, </span>as if to the tramp of the armies as they passed. (9) Anathoth; about four miles north of Jerusalem, the birth-place of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). There is a special pathos in the prophet's accents, a<span class= "ital">niyah Anathoth. </span>A various reading adopted by many critics gives, <span class= "ital">Answer, O Anathoth. </span>(10) Madmenah, or Madmen, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm" title="There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, as a Moabite city. The name ("dung-hill") was, however, not an uncommon one. It is named (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-31.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,">Joshua 15:31</a>) as one of the south-eastern cities of Judah. (11) The people of Gebim ("water-pits;" locality not identified) <span class= "ital">gather their goods for flight. </span>(12) At last the army reaches Nob, memorable as having been one of the resting-places of the Tabernacle in the time of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?">1Samuel 21:1</a>). The site has not been identified with certainty, but it was obviously a position that commanded Jerusalem, between it and Anathoth, probably not far from the hill <span class= "ital">Scopos </span>("watch-tower") where Titus and his troops encamped during the siege of Jerusalem. The prophet's narrative leaves the invader there shaking his hand, as with defiant menace, against the holy city. For "that day," read <span class= "ital">this very day, </span>fixing, as it were, the very hour at which Isaiah spoke.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-32.</span> - This graphic portraiture of the march of an Assyrian army on Jerusalem is probably not historic, but prophetic. Isaiah sees it in vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>), and describes it like an eye-witness. There are at present no sufficient means of deciding to what particular attack it refers, or indeed whether the march is one conducted by Sennacherib or Sargon. Sargon calls himself in one inscription "<span class="accented">conqueror</span> of the land of Judah" (Layard, 'Inscriptions,' 33:8), and the details of the present prophecy, especially ver. 9, suit the reign of Sargon rather than that of his son, so that on the whole it is perhaps most probable that some expedition of Sargon's is portrayed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is come to Aiath</span>. "Aiath" is probably Ai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-28</a>), with a feminine termination. It lay about three miles south of Bethel, which had become Assyrian with the conquest of Samaria. If an Assyrian army mustered at Bethel, it would naturally enter Judaean territory at Ai. <span class="cmt_word">He is passed to Migron</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he has passed through Migron</span>. "Migron" is mentioned as a village in the territory of Gibeah of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>); but the Migron of this passage must have been further to the north. <span class="cmt_word">He hath laid up his carriages</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "has left his baggage-train." Michmash was about seven miles nearly due north of Jerusalem. The heavy baggage might conveniently be left there, especially as it was difficult of attack (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4-13</a>), while a lightly equipped body of troops made a dash at Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:20-34 By our afflictions we may learn not to make creatures our confidence. Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, because of the anointing; for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, ver. 28-34, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.</body></html>
