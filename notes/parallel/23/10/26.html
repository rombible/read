There was another rod prominent in that Egyptian history besides that of the oppressor, and that rod had been wielded by the deliverer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord... shall stir up a scourge for him</span>; or, <span class="accented">lift up a scourge over him</span>. Isaiah uses the metaphor of the "scourge" again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16, 18</a>. It is rare in Scripture, though common among the Greek and Latin writers. <span class="cmt_word">According to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>). The "slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb" was that great destruction of the Midianites which was begun by the three hundred under Gideon, and completed by the men of Ephraim, whereof we have an account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-25</a>. Its counterpart in Assyrian history would seem to be the destruction of Sennacherib's army, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As his rod was upon the sea</span>. An allusion to the drowning of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea. This was a nearer parallel to the destruction of Sennacherib's army than the slaughter of the Midianites, since it was wholly miraculous. By "his rod" we may understand the rod of Moses, endued by God with miraculous powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After the manner of Egypt</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "after the manner of his action in Egypt." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:20-34 By our afflictions we may learn not to make creatures our confidence. Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, because of the anointing; for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, ver. 28-34, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.</body></html>
