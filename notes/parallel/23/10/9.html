One after another they had fallen. Could Judah hope to escape? (1) Calno, the Calneh of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm" title="Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?">Amos 6:2</a>. That prophet had held up its fate in vain as a warning to Samaria. It has been identified by Kay with Ctesiphon on the east bank of the Tigris, by Lenormant (<span class= "ital">Manual, </span>i. 80) with Ur of the Chaldees and with the ruins known now as the <span class= "ital">Mugheir, </span>by Rawlinson (<span class= "ital">Five Great Monarchies, </span>i. 20) with <span class= "ital">Nipur. </span>The Assyrian form, Kil-Anu, means the "house" or "temple" of Anu, an Assyrian deity). Sennacherib (Lenormant i. 398), speaks of having reconquered it after a Chaldean revolt, and sold its inhabitants as slaves. The LXX. version, which instead of naming Carchemish, gives "Calane, where the tower was built," seems to imply a tradition identifying that city with the Tower of Babel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm" title="And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>. (2) Carchemish. Few cities of the ancient world occupied a more prominent position than this. Its name has been explained as meaning the Tower of Chemosh, and so bears witness to the widespread <span class= "ital">cultus </span>of the deity whom we meet with in Biblical history as the "abomination of the Moabites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1Kings 11:7</a>). It has been commonly identified with the Circesium of Greek historians, but the inscriptions found by Mr. George Smith at <span class= "ital">Tarabolos </span>(the Hierapolis of the Greeks) on the banks of the Euphrates, at its junction with the <span class= "ital">Kyabur, </span>prove that this is the true representative of the great commercial city of the old Hittite kings (<span class= "ital">Times, </span>Aug. 23, 1876). Its importance is shown by the frequent occurrence of the name, in its Egyptian form of Karakumusha, in the record of Egyptian kings. Thothmes I. (<span class= "ital">circa </span>B.C. 1600) conquered it, and, as a result of his campaign, strengthened the forces of Egypt with the chariots and horses for which it was afterwards conspicuous (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Manual, </span>1 p. 229). Thothmes III. built a fortress there to guard the passage of the Euphrates (<span class= "ital">ibid. </span>1 p. 232), the ruins of which, with Egyptian inscriptions and works of Egyptian manufacture, have recently been found there (<span class= "ital">ibid. </span>1 p.,263). It revolted against Ramses II. (the Sesostris of the Greeks), with the Hittites and Ph?nicians, and other nations, but was subdued by him in the expedition in which the victorious issue is recorded on the monument on the <span class= "ital">Nahr-el-Kelb </span>near <span class= "ital">Beyr-t. </span>Shalmaneser IV. (contemporary with Ahab) records that he demolished and burnt it (<span class= "ital">ibid. </span>1 p. 380). Tiglath-pileser II., the king to whom Ahaz paid tribute, received tribute from its king in B.C. 742 (<span class= "ital">ibid. </span>1 p. 389). The last two victories are probably referred to in the boast now before us. At a later period it was conspicuous for the great defeat of Pharaoh Necho's army by Nebuchadnezzar (see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm" title="Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.">Jeremiah 46:2</a>). Its commercial importance is indicated by the fact that the "<span class= "ital">mana </span>(Heb., <span class= "ital">manah</span>) of Carchemish" appears in numerous cuneiform inscriptions as the standard weight of the time, just as that of Troyes, in the commerce of the Middle Ages, is shown by the survival of the name in the "Troy weight" of our arithmetic books (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 114).<p><span class= "bld">Is not Hamath as Arpad</span>?--(1) Hamath on the Orontes, the capital of an Aramaean kingdom, was prominent in the history of the East. Under its kings Toi and Joram it paid tribute to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/8-9.htm" title="When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,">2Samuel 8:9-10</a>). It fell under the power of Jeroboam II. of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm" title="He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.">2Kings 14:25</a>). In conjunction with Damascus it revolted against Shalmaneser IV., and was subdued by him (Lenormant's <span class= "ital">Manual, </span>1 p. 380). Its king was first among the tributary princes under Tiglath-pileser II. after having joined with Pekah and Rezin in their revolt (<span class= "ital">ibid. </span>1 p. 389). Lastly, to come to the date of the present prophecy, it again revolted, in conjunction, as before, with Damascus and Samaria, and was again subdued by Sargon (<span class= "ital">ibid. </span>1 p. 393). (2) Of the early history of Arpad we know less, but it appears as having sustained a three years' siege from the forces of Tiglath-pileser II. It joined Hamath in its revolt against Sargon, and was again, as this verse implies, subdued by him. It is always united in the Old Testament with Hamath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm" title="Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?">Isaiah 36:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-13.htm" title="Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?">Isaiah 37:13</a>). Under the name of <span class= "ital">Erfad </span>it is still traceable about nine miles from Aleppo (Lenormant, 1 pp. 389, 393).<p><span class= "bld">Is not Samaria as Damascus?</span>--These cities, which under Rezin and Remaliah had, as we have seen (Isaiah 7) revolted against Tiglath-pileser, and the latter of which had sought to strengthen itself by an alliance with the Egyptian king So, or Sabaco (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2Kings 17:4</a>), of the Ethiopian dynasty, against Shalmaneser IV., close for the present the list of Sargon's conquests.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not Calno as Carehemish</span>? A further proof of superiority, and ground of confidence, lay in the further fact, that the strongest cities had, one and all, succumbed to the Assyrian arms, and been laid in ruins to punish them for offering resistance. Six such cities are mentioned - Calneh, probably Niffer, in Lower Mesopotamia; Carchemish, on the right bank of the Euphrates in Lat. 36&deg; 30' nearly; Hamath, the "great Hamath" of Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>), in Coelesyria on the routes; Arpad, perhaps Tel-Erfad, near Aleppo; Damascus, and Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Calneh</span> was one of the cities of Nimrod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>), and, according to the LXX., was "the place where the tower was built." It may have been taken by Tiglath-Pileser in one of his expeditious into Babylonia. Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>) speaks of it as desolate in his day. <span class="cmt_word">Carchemish</span> (Assyrian <span class="accented">Gargamis</span>) was a chief city of the Hittites, and has been called "their northern capital." Long confounded by geographers with Circesium at the junction of the Khabour with the Euphrates, it has recently been proved to have occupied a far more northern position, and is now generally identified with the ruins discovered by Mr. George Smith at Jerabis or Jerabhs. It was conquered by Sargon in <span class="date">B.C. 717</span>, when "its people were led captive, and scattered over the Assyrian empire, while Assyrian colonists were brought to people the city in their place; Carchemish being formally annexed to Assyria, and placed under an Assyrian governor" (G. Smith, 'Assyria,' p. 97). <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span> was originally a Canaanite city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>). By the time of David it had become the scat of an independent monarchy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9, 10</a>), and so continued until its reduction by the Assyrians. We find it leagued with the Hittites, the Syrians of Damascus, and the Israelites against Assyria about <span class="date">B.C. 850</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 361-363). About <span class="date">B.C. 720</span> it was taken by Sargon, who beheaded its king, and probably reduced it to ruins (ibid., p. 411; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>). The name remains in the modern <span class="accented">Hamah</span>, where many curious inscriptions have been recently dug up. <span class="cmt_word">Arpad</span> was attacked by Tiglath-Pileser in the early part of his reign, and reduced to subjection. It revolted in conjunction with Hamath from Sargon, and was severely punished ('Ancient Monarchies,' l.s.c.). <span class="cmt_word">Is not Samaria as Damascus?</span> This mention of Samaria among the subjugated and ruined cities may undoubtedly be prophetic; but the connection with Carchemish, Hamath, and Arpad all of them towns reduced by Sargon within the years <span class="date">B.C. 720-717</span> - points rather to the verse being historical, and would seem to indicate that the date of the entire prophecy - vers. 5-19 - is subsequent to the capture of the cities, and so not earlier than <span class="date">B.C. 716</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-19 See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?</body></html>
