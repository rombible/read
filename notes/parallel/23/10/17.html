I would go through them, I would burn them together.">Isaiah 27:4</a>) to the enemies of Israel, is to Israel itself as the very light of life. The "briars and thorns" (we note the recurrence of the combination of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-18.htm" title="For wickedness burns as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.">Isaiah 9:18</a>) are the host of the Assyrian army (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-6.htm" title="But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:">2Samuel 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6</a>), as "the glory of his forest" in the next verse are the captains and princes. The emphatic "in one day" points to some great catastrophe, such as that which afterwards destroyed the army of Sennacherib.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light of Israel</span>. A new name of God. The idea on which it is based may be found in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>), and again in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>). God enlightens his people, cheers them, comforts them spiritually, as the light of the sun enlightens, cheers, and comforts men physically. Christ, as true God, is "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be for a fire.</span> As the same material fire which gives light, warmth, and comfort may burn and destroy, so the spiritual light, finding fit material, scorches and consumes. The fire which devours Assyria is to be kindled by God. <span class="cmt_word">His Holy One</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the Holy One of Israel" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). I<span class="cmt_word">t shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers.</span> The destruction of Assyria shall resemble that of Israel, in which Assyria was the instrument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-18.htm">Isaiah 9:18</a>). It shall be as complete, as terrible, and as final. <span class="cmt_word">In one day</span>. Scarcely "in one battle" (Cheyne); for the destruction of Assyria was effected by many battles, many sieges, and much exhausting ravage. "In one day" rather means "at one and the same time," "within a brief space." It is not to he taken literally. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:5-19 See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?</body></html>
