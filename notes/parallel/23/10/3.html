Had those corrupt judges asked themselves what they would do when the Supreme Judge should call them to account? Had they an ally who could protect them against Jehovah? Or had they found a hiding-place for the treasures which they had made their "glory"? Had they made a covenant with Hades and with death? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-18.htm" title="And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it.">Isaiah 28:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the day of visitation</span>? "The day of visitation" is the day when God reckons with his servants, and demands an account from each of the work done in his vineyard, being prepared to recompense the good and punish the bad (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>). It is oftenest used in a bad sense because, unhappily, so many more are found to deserve punishment than reward<span class="cmt_word">. The desolation which shall come from far</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the crashing ruin</span> (Cheyne). It is sudden, and complete destruction, rather than mere desolateness, that is threatened. Previous prophecies, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-20</a>, had informed the Jews that it was to "come from far," "by them that were beyond the river." <span class="cmt_word">To whom will ye flee</span>? The prophet speaks in bitter irony. Is there any one to whom ye can flee? any one who can protect you from the wrath of God? Ye well know there is no one. <span class="cmt_word">Where will ye leave your glory</span>? With whom will ye deposit your riches, your magnificence, your jewels, your grand apparel? You cannot save them. They will all make to themselves wings, and "fly away like a bird" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-4 These verses are to be joined with the foregoing chapter. Woe to the superior powers that devise and decree unrighteous decrees! And woe to the inferior officers that draw them up, and enter them on record! But what will sinners do? Whither will they flee?</body></html>
