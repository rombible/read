Dropping the direct address, and passing to the third person, the prophet seems to say as with a kind of ominous "aside," "No, there is no ally, no hiding-place but this, <span class= "ital">except they bow down among the captives or fall among the slain." </span>Exile or death, that was their only alternative. When that sentence has been uttered, the doom-bell, as we have called it, "For all this <span class= "bld">. . .</span>" tolls once more. If we adopt the Authorised version we have the same fact asserted, with the suggested thought that there was a refuge to be found in God.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Without me</span>. That this is a possible rendering of the word used seems proved by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>. But here it scarcely suits the context. God does not speak directly, in the first person, elsewhere in the entire prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-10:4</a>), but is spoken of in the third person throughout, as even in the present verse, where we have "his anger," "his hand." It is better, therefore, to give the word its ordinary meaning - "unless," "except." Have they anywhere to flee to, unless they shall crouch amid the captives that are being carried off, or fall amid the slain? In other words, there is no escape for them; they must either submit to captivity or death. <span class="cmt_word">For all this</span>, etc. Even when the two kingdoms were destroyed, and the captivity of both was complete, God's wrath was not fully appeased, his anger was not wholly turned away. Both peoples suffered grievous things in their captivity, as appears from the Book of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3, 6</a>.) and other places. It took seventy years for God's anger to be appeased in the case of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), while in the case of Israel it was never appeased. Crushed beneath the iron heel of their conquerors, Israel ceased to exist as a nation. SECTION V. PROPHECIES OF WOE UPON FOREIGN NATIONS (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-23</a>) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-4 These verses are to be joined with the foregoing chapter.
