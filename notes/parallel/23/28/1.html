The warning was clearly uttered before the capture of Samaria by Salmaneser, or, more probably, by Sargon, and paints in vivid colours--reminding us in part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4-6</a>, not without a side glance at the like vices in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm" title="And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.">Isaiah 22:13</a>)--the license into which the capital of the northern kingdom had fallen. With a bold personification the words paint (1) the banquet with its revellers, crowned, as in the later days of Rome, with wreaths of flowers; and (2) Samaria itself as such a wreath, once beautiful, now fading, crowning the "head" of the "fat," or luxuriant, valley (literally, <span class= "ital">valley of oils, </span>or, <span class= "ital">fat things</span>) in which the revellers held their feasts. Cheyne notes that the inscription of Salmaneser records that the tribute of Jehu consisted of bowls, cups, and goblets of gold, as illustrating the luxury of the palace of Samaria (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 41). The LXX. strangely renders the last clause, "drunk without wine," as if from a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm" title="Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry you out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.">Isaiah 29:9</a>, and gives the "hirelings of Ephraim" instead of "drunkards."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - A WARNING TO SAMARIA. The prophet has now east his eagle glance over the whole world and over all time. He has denounced woe upon all the principal nations of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13-23</a>.), glanced at the destruction of the world itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17-20</a>), and sung songs over the establishment of Christ's kingdom, and the ingathering of the nations into it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25.htm">Isaiah 25-27</a>.). In the present chapter he returns to the condition of things in his own time and among his own people. After a brief warning, addressed to Samaria, he turns to consider the condition of Judah, which he accuses of following the example of Samaria, of perishing through self-indulgence and lack of knowledge (vers. 7-12). He then proceeds to expostulate seriously with the "rulers of Jerusalem," on whom lies the chief responsibility for its future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the drunkards</span>, The "drunkards of Ephraim," or of the ten tribes, were at once intoxicated with wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) and with pride (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). As the external aspect of affairs grew mere and more threatening through the advances of Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser, they gave themselves up more and more to self-indulgence and luxury, lay upon beds of ivory, drank wine from bowls, feasted to the sound of the viol, and even invented fresh instruments of music (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4, 5</a>). At the same time, they said in their hearts, "Have we not taken by our own strength?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). They persisted in regarding themselves as secure, when even ordinary political foresight might have seen that their end was approaching. <span class="cmt_word">Whose glorious beauty is a fading flower</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty</span>. The "glorious beauty" of Samaria was a beauty of magnificent luxury. "Summer" and "winter houses," distinct each from the other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>); "ivory palaces" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>); a wealth of "gardens, vineyards, fig-orchards, and olive yards" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>); residences of "hewn stone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>); feasts enlivened with "the melody of viols" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>); "beds of ivory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>); "wine in bowls" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>); "chief ointments" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>); constituted a total of luxurious refinement beyond which few had proceeded at the time, and which Isaiah was fain to recognize, in a worldly point of view, as "glorious" and "beautiful." But the beauty was of a kind liable to fade, and it was already fading under the sirocco of Assyrian invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Which are on the head of the fat valleys</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which is on the head</span> (or, <span class="accented">which decks the head</span>) <span class="accented">of the rich valley</span>. Samaria was built on a hill of an oval form, which rose up in the midst of a fertile valley shut in by mountains. The prophet identifies the valley with the kingdom itself, and then personifies it, and regards its head as crowned by the fading flower of Samaria's beauty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-4 What men are proud of, be it ever so mean, is to them as a crown; but pride is the forerunner of destruction. How foolishly drunkards act! Those who are overcome with wine are overcome by Satan; and there is not greater drudgery in the world than hard drinking. Their health is ruined; men are broken in their callings and estates, and their families are ruined by it. Their souls are in danger of being undone for ever, and all merely to gratify a base lust. In God's professing people, like Israel, it is worse than in any other. And he is just in taking away the plenty they thus abuse. The plenty they were proud of, is but a fading flower. Like the early fruit, which, as soon as discovered, is plucked and eaten.</body></html>
