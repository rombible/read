The eye of the prophet passes from the beginning to the end of the husbandman's work. He finds there also the varying methods of a like discrimination. A man would be thought mad who threshed his fennel seed and cummin with the same instrument that he uses for his barley and his wheat. It is enough to beat or tap them with the "rod," or "staff," which was, in fact, used in each case. Interpreting this parable, we may see in the fennel and the cummin the little ones of the earth, with whom God deals more gently than with the strong. "Tribulation," as the etymology of the word (<span class= "ital">tribulum, </span>a threshing instrument) tells us, is a threshing process. The lesson of the parable is that it comes to nations and individuals in season and in measure. The main idea is familiar enough in the language of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm" title="Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass: and you shall beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain to the LORD, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.">Micah 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-12.htm" title="You did march through the land in indignation, you did thresh the heathen in anger.">Habakkuk 3:12</a>). The novelty of Isaiah's treatment of it consists in his bringing in the minute details, and drawing this lesson from them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing-instrument.</span> The <span class="accented">Nigella sativa</span> is too lender a plant to be subjected to the rude treatment of a threshing-instrument, or "threshing-sledge." Such instruments are of the coarsest and clumsiest character in the East, and quite inapplicable to plants of a delicate fabric. Karsten Niebuhr thus describes the Arabian and Syrian practices: "Quand le grain dolt etre battu, les Arabes de Yemen posent le bled par terre en deux tangles, epis center epis, apres quoi ils font trainer par-dessus <span class="accented">une grosse pierre</span> tiree par deux boeufs. La machine dent on se sert en Syrie consiste en <span class="accented">quelques planches</span> garnies par-dessous d'une quantite de pierres a fusil" ('Description de l'Arabie,' p. 140). <span class="cmt_word">Neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin</span>. The allusion is to aim the coarse mode of threshing practiced in Palestine and elsewhere, by driving a cart with broad wheels over the grain. <span class="cmt_word">But the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod</span>. Canon Tristram says, "While the cummin can easily be separated from its case by a slender rod, the harder pod of the <span class="accented">Nigella</span> requires to be beaten by a stout staff" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 445). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:23-29 The husbandman applies to his calling with pains and prudence, in all the works of it according to their nature. Thus the Lord, who has given men this wisdom, is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in his working. As the occasion requires, he threatens, corrects, spares, shows mercy, or executes vengeance. Afflictions are God's threshing instruments, to loosen us from the world, to part between us and our chaff, and to prepare us for use. God will proportion them to our strength; they shall be no heavier than there is need. When his end is answered, the trials and sufferings of his people shall cease; his wheat shall be gathered into the garner, but the chaff shall be burned with unquenchable fire.</body></html>
