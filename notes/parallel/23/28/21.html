Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.">2Samuel 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-11.htm" title="So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God has broken in on my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.">1Chronicles 14:11</a>), and at Gibeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-16.htm" title="David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.">1Chronicles 14:16</a>) is that then Jehuah had interposed on behalf of His people against their enemies. The "new and strange" work--the very paradox of prophecy--was that He would now rise up to overthrow His own people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim</span>. The "Mount Perazim" of this passage is probably the same as the "Baal-Perazim" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-11.htm">1 Chronicles 14:11</a>, where David completely defeated the Philistines by the Divine help. This victory is connected with another over the same nation in <span class="cmt_word">the valley of Gibeon</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-13.htm">1 Chronicles 14:13-16</a>). Now, however, God was to be on the side of the enemies of his people, who were to suffer as the Philistines had suffered in the olden time. This punishment of Ida own people by the sword of foreigners was <span class="cmt_word">strange</span> <span class="cmt_word">work on God's part</span> - <span class="cmt_word">a strange act</span>. But it was their strange conduct which caused God's strange action. They had become as it were, Philistines. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:16-22 Here is a promise of Christ, as the only foundation of hope for escaping the wrath to come. This foundation was laid in Zion, in the eternal counsels of God. This foundation is a stone, firm and able to support his church. It is a tried stone, a chosen stone, approved of God, and never failed any who made trial of it. A corner stone, binding together the whole building, and bearing the whole weight; precious in the sight of the Lord, and of every believer; a sure foundation on which to build. And he who in any age or nation shall believe this testimony, and rest all his hopes, and his never-dying soul on this foundation, shall never be confounded. The right effect of faith in Christ is, to quiet and calm the soul, till events shall be timed by Him, who has all times in his own hand and power. Whatever men trust to for justification, except the righteousness of Christ; or for wisdom, strength, and holiness, except the influences of the Holy Ghost; or for happiness, except the favour of God; that protection in which they thought to shelter themselves, will prove not enough to answer the intention. Those who rest in a righteousness of their own, will have deceived themselves: the bed is too short, the covering too narrow. God will be glorified in the fulfilling of his counsels. If those that profess to be members of God's church, make themselves like Philistines and Canaanites, they must expect to be dealt with as such. Then dare not to ridicule the reproofs of God's word, or the approaches of judgements.</body></html>
