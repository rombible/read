(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-23.htm" title="For you shall be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.">Job 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm" title="And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.">Hosea 2:18</a>.) Cheyne quotes Lucan, ix. 394, <span class= "ital">Pax illis cum morte data est </span>(They have made peace with death"). "Hell" is the Hebrew Sheol (Hades), the region of the dead. The two are joined together, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm" title="I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be your plagues; O grave, I will be your destruction: repentance shall be hid from my eyes.">Hosea 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/20-13.htm" title="And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">When the overflowing scourge . . .</span>--The words probably implied a sneer at the imagery which the prophet had used, painting the Assyrian invasion first as a flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>), and then as a scourge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:24</a>). (Comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm" title="Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.">Isaiah 28:2</a>.) The scorners think that their "lies" will give them a refuge from the danger under either form.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have made a covenant with death</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-23.htm">Job 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>). The words are a boast, expressed somewhat enigmatically, that they have secured their own safety by some secret agreement. The exact nature of the agreement they are disinclined to divulge. <span class="cmt_word">With hell are we at agreement</span>. A "<span class="accented">synonymous</span> parallelism," merely strengthening the previous assertion. <span class="cmt_word">When the overflowing scourge shall pass through</span>. Assyrian invasion has been compared to a "flood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>), and to a "rod" or "staff" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>. Here the two metaphors are joined together. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not come to us</span>. Some means will be found - what, they do not say, either for diverting the flood, or for stemming it. <span class="cmt_word">For we have made lies our refuge</span>. Here the Divine reporter departs from the language of those whose words he is reporting, and substitutes his own estimate of the true nature and true value of that "refuge" on which they placed such entire reliance. It appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6-9</a> that that refuge was Egypt. Now, Egypt was a "bruised reed," not to be depended on for keeping her engagements. To trust in her was to put confidence in "lies" and "falsehood." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:5-15 The prophet next turns to Judah, whom he calls the residue of his people. Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hosts himself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service and every conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy God communicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunk with wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves, but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taught are filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it is needful that the same precept and the same line should be often repeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by his word, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of God is the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and there is no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All this had little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand what is plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justly punished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made a covenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any real damage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend, while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not they make lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to a death-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it is no longer in their power to do so.</body></html>
