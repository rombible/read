(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-12.htm" title="All your strong holds shall be like fig trees with the first ripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.">Nahum 3:12</a>.) Such a fig the passer-by seizes, and eagerly devours. So, the prophet says, with a Dante-like homeliness of comparison, should the Assyrian king treat Samaria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the glorious beauty</span>, etc. Translate, <span class="accented">And the fading flower of his glorious beauty</span>, <span class="accented">which is on the head of the fat valley</span>, <span class="accented">shall be like an early fig</span> (<span class="accented">that comes</span>) <span class="accented">before the harvest</span>. Such an "early fig" is a tempting delicacy, devoured as soon as seen (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-12.htm">Nahum 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>, etc.). The "beauty" of Samaria would tempt the Assyrians to desire it so soon as they saw it, and would rouse an appetite which would be content with nothing less than the speedy absorption of the coveted morsel. Samaria's siege, once begun, was pressed without intermission, and lasted less than three years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9, 10</a>) - a short space compared to that of other sieges belonging to about the same period; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that of Ashdod, besieged twenty-nine years (Herod., 2. 157); that of Tyre, besieged thirteen years ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3:492). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-4 What men are proud of, be it ever so mean, is to them as a crown; but pride is the forerunner of destruction. How foolishly drunkards act! Those who are overcome with wine are overcome by Satan; and there is not greater drudgery in the world than hard drinking. Their health is ruined; men are broken in their callings and estates, and their families are ruined by it. Their souls are in danger of being undone for ever, and all merely to gratify a base lust. In God's professing people, like Israel, it is worse than in any other. And he is just in taking away the plenty they thus abuse. The plenty they were proud of, is but a fading flower. Like the early fruit, which, as soon as discovered, is plucked and eaten.</body></html>
