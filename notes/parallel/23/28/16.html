The former connects itself with the importance which attached, in ancient as in modern architecture, to the foundation stone of a building (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm" title="And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.">1Kings 5:17</a>). So in Zion the foundation stone was laid, as witnessed in the Arabic name of the Mosque of Omar (<span class= "ital">Kubhet-es-Sakhra</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"dome of the rock"), on the solid rock. In the stone which was made "the head of the corner" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm" title="The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.">Psalm 118:22</a>) we have a like thought. From the prophet's stand-point this was identical with the manifestation of Jehovah's righteousness in and through the Temple in its higher spiritual aspect. Christian interpreters have rightly found the true fulfilment of the words in the person of the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1Peter 2:6-7</a>). The "corner stone," the <span class= "ital">lapis angularis </span>of the Vulg. is that upon which two walls at right angles to each other rest and are bonded together. The "tried stone" (literally, <span class= "ital">stone of proof</span>) may be one (1) which stands every test, or (2) one which tries those who come in contact with it, becoming an asylum, or a "stone of stumbling," according to their character. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/2-34.htm" title="And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;">Luke 2:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-18.htm" title="Whoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.">Luke 20:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He that believeth shall not make haste.</span>--The LXX. and some other versions give "shall not be ashamed," which is a paraphrase rather than a translation. The English Version, following the Vulgate, represents the meaning of the Hebrew, haste and hurry being regarded in their contrast to the calm temper of a steadfast faith. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm" title="That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!">Isaiah 5:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone</span>. In contrast with the insecure refuge and false ground of confidence whereon the nobles relied, the prophet puts forward the one sure "Rock" on which complete dependence may be placed - which he declares that Jehovah is laying, or "has laid," in Zion as <span class="cmt_word">a tried stone, a precious corner stone</span>, a sure foundation. The imagery is, no doubt, drawn from the practice of Oriental kings, and notably Solomon, to employ foundation-stones of enormous size and weight at the corners of buildings. Some of those uncovered at the corners of Solomon's temple by the Palestine Exploration Fund are more than thirty-eight feet long, and weigh above a hundred tons (see 'Our Work in Palestine,' pp. 38, 115). But the reference cannot, of course, be to the material structure of the temple as Israel's true refuge. Rather, Jehovah himself would seem to be the Rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>, etc.) intended; and hence the application to Christ by the writers of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-8</a>) was natural and easy. But it may be questioned whether the passage was to Isaiah himself "Messianic," or meant more than that God had set his Name and his presence at Jerusalem from the time that the temple was built there, and that it was a mistake to look elsewhere titan to him for deliverance or security. <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth shall not make haste</span>. The LXX. have "He that believeth shall not be <span class="accented">ashamed"</span> or "confounded;" and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>) follows this rendering. It is conjectured that the Hebrew had originally <span class="accented">yabish</span> instead of <span class="accented">yakhish</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:16-22 Here is a promise of Christ, as the only foundation of hope for escaping the wrath to come. This foundation was laid in Zion, in the eternal counsels of God. This foundation is a stone, firm and able to support his church. It is a tried stone, a chosen stone, approved of God, and never failed any who made trial of it. A corner stone, binding together the whole building, and bearing the whole weight; precious in the sight of the Lord, and of every believer; a sure foundation on which to build. And he who in any age or nation shall believe this testimony, and rest all his hopes, and his never-dying soul on this foundation, shall never be confounded. The right effect of faith in Christ is, to quiet and calm the soul, till events shall be timed by Him, who has all times in his own hand and power. Whatever men trust to for justification, except the righteousness of Christ; or for wisdom, strength, and holiness, except the influences of the Holy Ghost; or for happiness, except the favour of God; that protection in which they thought to shelter themselves, will prove not enough to answer the intention. Those who rest in a righteousness of their own, will have deceived themselves: the bed is too short, the covering too narrow. God will be glorified in the fulfilling of his counsels. If those that profess to be members of God's church, make themselves like Philistines and Canaanites, they must expect to be dealt with as such. Then dare not to ridicule the reproofs of God's word, or the approaches of judgements.</body></html>
