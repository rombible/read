He has painted the drunkards of Ephraim; now he turns and paints in yet darker colours the drunkards of Judah. Priests were seen reeling to their services, prophets reeling in the very act of their counterfeit inspiration. The threefold iteration of the word for "reel" emphasises the scandals of the scene. The sins of the sons of Eli, those of which Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm" title="The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.">Isaiah 2:11</a>) had spoken, were reproduced in all their enormity. The most loathsome features of their drunkenness are printed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-8.htm" title="For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.">Isaiah 28:8</a> with a boldness which is almost photographic. The prohibition of wine during the time when the priests were on duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/10-1.htm" title="And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.">Leviticus 10:1-9</a>) adds to the guilt thus represented.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - JUDAH'S SINFULNESS. The reformation effected by Hezekiah was but a half-reformation. It put away idolatry, but it left untouched a variety of moral evils, as: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Drunkenness. Judah was no whir behind Ephraim in respect of this vice. The very priests and "prophets" gave way to the disgusting habit, and came drunk to the most solemn functions of religious teaching and hearing causes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Scorn and mockery of God's true prophets. The teaching of Isaiah was made light of by the officials of the priestly and prophetic orders, who claimed to be quite as competent to instruct men in their duties as himself. They seem to have ridiculed the mode of his teaching - its catch-words, as they thought them, and its insistence on minutiae. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They also</span>. Judah, no less than Ephraim (see vers. 1, 3). It has been questioned whether literal intoxication is meant, and suggested that Judah "imitated the pride and unbelief and <span class="accented">spiritual intoxication</span> of Ephraim" (Kay). But the numerous passages which tax both the Israelites and the Jews of the period with drunkenness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-12.htm">Isaiah 56:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, etc.), are best understood literally. Orientals (e.g, the Persians) are often given to such indulgence. <span class="cmt_word">Have erred through wine;</span> rather, <span class="accented">reel with wine</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Are out of the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">stagger</span>. The verbs express the physical effects of intoxication. <span class="cmt_word">The priest and the prophet</span>. Priests were forbidden by the Law to drink any wine or strong drink previously to their taking part in the service of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>), and the prohibition was always understood to apply <span class="accented">afortiori to</span> the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>). Prophets might have been expected to act in the spirit of the command given to priests. By "prophets" here Isaiah means, not persons especially called of God, but official members of the prophetical order. Of these there were always many in Judah, who had no strong sense of religion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-12.htm">Amos 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They err in vision</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they reel in the vision</span>. They are drunken, even in the very exercise of their prophetical office - when they see, and expound, their visions. <span class="cmt_word">They stumble in judgment</span>; or, <span class="accented">they stagger when pronouncing judgment</span> (Delitzsch). Persons in authority had been specially warned not to drink wine before the hearing of causes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4, 5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:5-15 The prophet next turns to Judah, whom he calls the residue of his people. Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hosts himself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service and every conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy God communicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunk with wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves, but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taught are filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it is needful that the same precept and the same line should be often repeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by his word, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of God is the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and there is no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All this had little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand what is plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justly punished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made a covenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any real damage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend, while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not they make lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to a death-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it is no longer in their power to do so.</body></html>
