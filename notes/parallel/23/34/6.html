one in the Hauran, more or less conspicuous in ecclesiastical history, and the other, of which Isaiah now speaks, in Edom. It was a strongly fortified city, and is named again and again. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-12.htm" title="But I will send a fire on Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.">Amos 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm" title="For I have sworn by myself, said the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.">Jeremiah 49:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.">Jeremiah 49:22</a>.) The image both of the sword and the sacrifice appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm" title="For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.">Jeremiah 46:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sword of the Lord is filled</span>; or, <span class="accented">glutted</span> (Lowth). The tense is "the perfect of prophetic certainty." <span class="cmt_word">It is made fat with fatness</span>. "Fed, as it were, on the fat of sacrifices" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3, 4, 9, 10, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-3.htm">Leviticus 7:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Lambs... goats... rams</span>. The lesser cattle represent the lower classes of those about to be slain, while the "<span class="accented">unicorns"</span> and "<span class="accented">bullocks"</span> of ver. 7 represent the upper classes - the great men and leaders. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah</span>. This Bozrah, one of the principal cities of Idumaea, is to be distinguished from "Bozrah of Moab," which was known to the Romans as "Bostra." It lay in the hilly country to the south-cast of the Dead Sea, about thirty-five miles north of Petra, and was one of the earliest settlements of the descendants of Esau, being mentioned as a well-known place in Genesis 34:33). The threats here uttered against it are repeated by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>), who says that "Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; all the cities thereof [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dependent cities] shall be perpetual wastes." Bozrah is probably identified with the modern <span class="accented">El-Busaireh</span>, a village of about fifty houses, occupying a site in the position above indicated, amid ruins which seem to be those of a considerable city (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 407; Robinson, 'Researches in Palestine,' vol. 2. pp. 570, 571). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-8 Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which are both righteous and successful. All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is glorified.</body></html>
