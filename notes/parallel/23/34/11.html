Compare the prophecy against Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a>. The Hebrew word translated "cormorant," is now generally regarded as designating the "pelican," while the one rendered "bittern" is thought by some to mean "hedgehog" or "porcupine." Animals that delight in solitude are certainly meant, but the particular species is, more or less, matter of conjecture. <span class="cmt_word">He shall stretch out upon it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and one shall stretch</span> out <span class="accented">upon it</span>.

The destruction of cities was effected by rule and measure, probably because different portions of the <span class="accented">task</span> were assigned to different sets of laborers, and, if the work was to be completely done, it required to be done systematically. Here, the measuring-tape and the plumb-line are to be these of <span class="accented">tohu</span> and <span class="accented">vohu</span>, or of the eternal chaos out of which God, by his word, produced order (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:9-17 Those who aim to ruin the church, can never do that, but will ruin themselves. What dismal changes sin can make! It turns a fruitful land into barrenness, a crowded city into a wilderness. Let us compare all we discover in the book of the Lord, with the dealings of providence around us, that we may be more diligent in seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness. What the mouth of the Lord has commanded, his Spirit will perform. And let us observe how the evidences of the truth continually increase, as one prophecy after another is fulfilled, until these awful scenes bring in more happy days. As Israel was a figure of the Christian church, so the Edomites, their bitter enemies, represent the enemies of the kingdom of Christ. God's Jerusalem may be laid in ruins for a time, but the enemies of the church shall be desolate for ever.</body></html>
