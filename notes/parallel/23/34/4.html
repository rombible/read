Like the psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm" title="They shall perish, but you shall endure: yes, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a clothing shall you change them, and they shall be changed:">Psalm 102:26</a>), Isaiah contrasts the transitoriness of sun, moon, and stars, with the eternity of Jehovah. The Greek poets sing that the "life of the generations of men is as the life of the leaves of the trees" (Homer, <span class= "ital">Il. vi.</span> 146). To Isaiah's sublime thoughts there came the vision of a time when even the host of heaven would fall as "a leaf from the vine, and as a fig from the fig-tree."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the host of heaven shall be dissolved</span>. A dissolution of the material frame of the heavens, in which the moon and stars are regarded as set, seems to be intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). The slaughter of God's enemies is here connected with the cud of the world, as in the Book of Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a book</span>. Ancient books were written on long strips of paper or parchment, which, when unrolled, extended to many yards in length, but which might be rolled together "by means of one or two smooth round sticks into a very small compass." Such a rolling together of the widely extended heavens is here intended, not a shriveling by means of heat (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All their host shall fall</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>, "The stars shall fall from heaven"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-8 Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which are both righteous and successful. All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is glorified.</body></html>
