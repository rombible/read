There, however, the sword is soaked, or made drunk with blood. Here it is "bathed <span class= "ital">in heaven," </span>and this seems to require a different meaning. We read in Greek poets, of the "dippings" by which steel was tempered. May not the "bathing" of Isaiah have a like significance?<p><span class= "bld">It shall come down upon Idumea . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for Edom, </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> here and in the next verse.

Some suppose a reference to the old" war in heaven," when the sword of Divine justice was drawn against the devil and his angels. Others regard the sword now to be used against the Idumeans as first, in heaven, "made drunken" with the Divine anger. <span class="cmt_word">It shall come down upon Idumea</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>). The Edomites first showed themselves enemies of Israel when they refused to allow the Israelites, under Moses, "a passage through their border" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>). David subdued them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>:14); but they revolted from Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-8.htm">2 Chronicles 21:8-10</a>), and were thenceforward among the most bitter adversaries of the southern kingdom. They "smote Judah" in the reign of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>), and were always ready to "shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>). Amos speaks of them very much in the same tone as Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11, 12</a>). They ultimately "filled up the measure of their iniquities" by open rejoicing when Jerusalem was destroyed, and the people led away captive by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10-13</a>). In the present passage we must regard the Edomites as representative of the enemies of God's people generally (see the introductory paragraph). <span class="cmt_word">The people of my curse</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the people on whom I have laid a curse" - the Edomites. Esau was to "serve" Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>), Edom to be "a possession" for Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>). God had said of Edom, probably before Isaiah uttered the present prophecy, "For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof... but I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11, 12</a>). Thus Edom was under a curse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-8 Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which are both righteous and successful. All nations are concerned. And as they have all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feel his resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideas of the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity with the church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reach the horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church of Christ. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We must patiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. Through Christ, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently with justice, and his name is glorified.</body></html>
