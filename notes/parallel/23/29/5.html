The multitude of thy strangers; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "of thy enemies" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5</a>). In primitive societies every stranger is an enemy; and hence language - the formation of primitive men - often has one word for the two ideas. In Latin <span class="accented">hostis</span> is said to have originally meant "foreigner" (Cic., 'De Off',' 1:12). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be like small dust</span>. Ground down, <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> an impalpable powder - rendered utterly weak and powerless. The meaning is determined by the clause which follows, with which it must necessarily be in close accordance. <span class="cmt_word">As chaff that passeth away</span>. "Chaff," in Scripture, is always a metaphor for weakness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-3.htm">Hosea 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>). It has no value; man's object is to get rid of it: a light wind carries it away, and no one inquires whither. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.</span> Dr. Kay says it is "the collapse of Jerusalem" which is here intended. But most other commentators understand, with more reason, the collapse of her enemies (Cheyne, Delitzsch, Vance Smith, Knobel, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-8 Ariel may signify the altar of burnt-offerings. Let Jerusalem know that outward religious services will not make men free from judgements. Hypocrites never can please God, nor make their peace with him. God had often and long, by a host of angels, encamped round about Jerusalem for protection and deliverance; but now he fought against it. Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down by humbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold. The army of Sennacherib went as a dream; and thus the multitudes, that through successive ages fight against God's altar and worship, shall fall. Speedily will sinners awake from their soothing dreams in the pains of hell.</body></html>
