He paints as not far off the restoration at once of the face of nature and of the life of man. Lebanon, that had been stripped of its cedars by the Assyrian invader (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm" title="And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.">Isaiah 10:34</a>), so as to be as the wilderness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get you to this treasurer, even to Shebna, which is over the house, and say,">Isaiah 22:15</a>, should regain its glory, and once more be as Carmel, or "the fruitful field," while the fields that had rejoiced in the rich growth of herbage and shrubs should attain the greatness of the forests of Lebanon as they had been. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-15.htm" title="Until the spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.">Isaiah 32:15</a>, where "the wilderness" answers to the "Lebanon" of this verse.) The thought and the language would seem to have been among Isaiah's favourite utterances.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - A RENEWAL OF PROMISE. God's judgment (ver. 14), whatever it is, will pass. In a little while there will be a great change. The lowly will be exalted, the proud abased. From the "meek" and "poor' will be raised a body of true worshippers, who will possess spiritual discernment (ver. 18), while the oppressors and "scorners" will be brought to naught. <span class="accented">When</span> Isaiah expected this change is uncertain; but he holds out the hope of it here, as elsewhere so frequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>, etc.), to keep up the spirits of the people and prevent them from sinking into a state of depression and despair. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field</span>. Lebanon, the wild forest, shall become smiling garden-ground, while garden-ground shall revert into wild uncultivated forest. An inversion of the moral condition of Judaea is shadowed forth by the metaphor. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:17-24 The wonderful change here foretold, may refer to the affairs of Judah, though it looks further. When a great harvest of souls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all. See the change religion produces in the hearts of men, and the peace and pleasure of a humble and devout spirit.</body></html>
