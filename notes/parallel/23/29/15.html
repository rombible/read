The sins of which he speaks here may have been either the dark sensualities which lay beneath the surface of religion, or, more probably, their clandestine intrigues with this or that foreign power--Egypt, Ethiopia, Babylon--against the Assyrian invader, instead of trusting in the Lord of hosts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord</span>. The allusion is to the schemes which were afloat for calling in the aid of Egypt. As Isaiah had long since denounced these schemes as the height of folly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11-17</a>), and prophesied their failure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5, 6</a>), every effort was made to conceal them from his knowledge end from the knowledge of all who were like-minded (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1, 2</a>). Steps were probably even now being taken for the carrying out of the schemes, which were studiously concealed from the prophet. <span class="cmt_word">Their works are in the dark.</span> Underhand proceedings ere at all times suspicious. "Men love darkness rather than light, <span class="accented">because their deeds are evil</span>." The very fact of concealment was an indication that the works in which the rulers were engaged were evil, and that they knew them to be evil. <span class="cmt_word">They say, Who seeth us?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>, "Tush, they say, How should God perceive? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"). The wicked persuade themselves that God does not see their actions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:9-16 The security of sinners in sinful ways, is cause for lamentation and wonder. The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.</body></html>
