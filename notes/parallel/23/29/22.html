That history was for the prophet the assurance that Jehovah would not abandon him to his accusers.<p><span class= "bld">Jacob shall not now be ashamed . . .</span>--The patriarch appears, as Rachel does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, as if watching over the fortunes of his descendants with varying emotions. Those emotions had been of shame and terror; now there was the dawning of a brighter day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord, who redeemed Abraham</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who delivered Abraham</span>, as the verb used is often rendered (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-18.htm">Psalm 69:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-42.htm">Psalm 78:42</a>, etc.). God's directions to Abraham to remove from a land of idolaters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2, 3</a>) were practically a "deliverance." The work thus commenced could not be suffered to remain incomplete. Israel - the true Israel - <span class="cmt_word">would not be ashamed</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">wax pale</span> through fear any more; they would be God's children, his true worshippers, and would have no need to experience either fear or shame. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:17-24 The wonderful change here foretold, may refer to the affairs of Judah, though it looks further. When a great harvest of souls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all. See the change religion produces in the hearts of men, and the peace and pleasure of a humble and devout spirit.</body></html>
