It may have been coined by Isaiah himself. It may have been part of the secret language of the prophetic schools, as Sheshach stood for Babel (Jer ), Rahab for Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?">Isaiah 51:9</a>), and in the language of later Rabbis, Edom, and in that of the Apocalypse, Babel, for Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm" title="And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.">Revelation 17:5</a>). Modern language has, it will be remembered, like names of praise and scorn for England and France, though these (John Bull, the British Lion, Crapaud, and the Gallic Cock) scarcely rise to the level of poetry. "Ariel" has been variously interpreted as "the lion of God," or "the hearth of God." The first meaning has in its favour the use of the same word for men of special heroism in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion like men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow:">2Samuel 23:20</a> (" lion-like men," as in the margin, "lions of God"), and perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-7.htm" title="Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.">Isaiah 33:7</a> (see Note). The "lion" was, it may be noted, the traditional symbol of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm" title="And one of the elders said to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.">Revelation 5:5</a>). In the words that follow, "the city where David dwelt," the prophet interprets the mystic name for the benefit of his readers. The verb for "dwelt" conveys the sense of "encamping." David had dwelt securely in the rock-fortress of Zion.<p><span class= "bld">Add ye year to year.</span>--The word implies the solemn keeping of the New Year festival. The people might keep that festival and offer many sacrifices, but this would not avail to ward off the tribulation which they deserved, and at which the prophet had hinted in the last verse of the preceding chapter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - A WARNING TO JERUSALEM. Expostulation is followed by threats. The prophet is aware that all his preaching to the authorities in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14-22</a>) will be of no avail, and that their adoption of measures directly antagonistic to the commands of God will bring on the very evil which they are seeking to avert, and cause Jerusalem to be actually besieged by her enemies. In the present passage he distinctly announces the siege, and declares that it will commence within a year. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt</span>! "Ariel' is clearly a mystic name for Jerusalem, parallel to "Sheshach" as a name for Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>) and "'Ir-ha-heres" as a name for Heliopolis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>). It is generally explained as equivalent to Art-El, "lion of God;" but Delitzsch suggests the meaning of "hearth of God," or "altar of God," a signification which "Ariel" seems to have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-15.htm">Ezekiel 43:15, 16</a>. But there is no evidence that "Ariel" was ever employed in this sense before the time of Ezekiel. Etymologically, "Ariel" can only mean "lion of God," and the name would in this sense be sufficiently descriptive of the Jewish capital, which had always hitherto been a sort of champion of Jehovah - a warrior fighting his battles with a lion's courage and fierceness. <span class="cmt_word">Dwelt</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pitched his</span> tent - an expression recalling the old tent-life of the Hebrews (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye year to year</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">year to a year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the coming year to the present one. The intention is to date the commencement of the siege. It will fall within the year next ensuing. <span class="cmt_word">Let them kill sacrifices</span>. The best modern authorities translate, "Let <span class="accented">the feasts run their round"</span> (Kay, Cheyne, Delitzsch); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let there be one more round of the annual festival-times, and then let the enemy march in and commence the siege. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-8 Ariel may signify the altar of burnt-offerings. Let Jerusalem know that outward religious services will not make men free from judgements. Hypocrites never can please God, nor make their peace with him. God had often and long, by a host of angels, encamped round about Jerusalem for protection and deliverance; but now he fought against it. Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down by humbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold. The army of Sennacherib went as a dream; and thus the multitudes, that through successive ages fight against God's altar and worship, shall fall. Speedily will sinners awake from their soothing dreams in the pains of hell.</body></html>
