They are staggered, startled, incredulous, and he bursts into words of vehement reproof. The form of the verb implies that their astonished unbelief was self-caused. The change from the second person to the third implies that the prophet paused for a moment in his address to describe their state as an observer. Outwardly, they were as men too drunk to understand, but their drunkenness was not that of the "wine<span class= "ital">" </span>or the "strong drink" of the fermented palm-juice, in which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm" title="But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.">Isaiah 28:7</a>, the prophet implies that they habitually indulged. Now their drunkenness was of another type.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - NEITHER WARNING NOR PROMISE COMPREHENDED BY THOSE TO WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, "Who hath believed our report?" says the prophet in another place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), "and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" It was among the most painful circumstances attaching to the prophetical office, that scarcely ever was the prophet held in any esteem among his own people, or in his own lifetime. Isaiah knows that his warning will fall dead - that the people and their rulers have neither "eyes to see" nor "ears to hear." He places on record this knowledge, while at the same time striving if by any means he may arouse some from their condition of dull apathy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stay yourselves, and wonder</span>; rather, <span class="accented">stand stupefied and be astonished</span>. The prophet bids them act as he knows that they will act. They will simply "stare with astonishment" at a prophecy which will seem to them "out of all relation to facts" (Cheyne). They will not yield it the slightest credence. They will only marvel how a sane man could have uttered such egregious folly. <span class="cmt_word">Cry ye out, and cry</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "Blind yourselves, and be blind," which certainly gives a much better sense, and is justified by the use of the same verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>. As Pharaoh began by hardening his own heart, and then God hardened it ('Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, pp. 103, 166, 203, etc.), so those who blind their own eyes, and will not see when they have the power, are, in the end, if they persist, judicially blinded by God. <span class="cmt_word">They are drunken, but not with wine.</span> "The drunkards of Ephraim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>) were such literally. They "erred through strong drink" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>); they "were swallowed up of wine;" but the case was different with the infatuated ones of Judah. They were morally, not physically, intoxicated. Their pride and self-trust rendered them as irrational and as unimpressionable as ever drunkenness rendered any man; but they were not actual drunkards. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:9-16 The security of sinners in sinful ways, is cause for lamentation and wonder. The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.</body></html>
