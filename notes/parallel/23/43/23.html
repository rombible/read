If this reproach is regarded as addressed to <span class="accented">captive</span> Israel, who <span class="accented">could not</span> offer sacrifices, we must explain it by the analogy of the expression, "the calves of your lips" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>). All prayer may be regarded as a sort of offering, and withholding it as withholding sacrifice. But it is possible that the prophet is not addressing captive Israel only, but carrying his thoughts back to the period preceding the Captivity, when there was a general neglect of God's service, and for a time the temple was given up to idol-worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>).

Meat offerings were to accompany every sacrifice, but were a small burthen. Incense was not required from any private person. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:22-28 Those who neglect to call upon God, are weary of him. The Master tired not the servants with his commands, but they tired him with disobedience. What were the riches of God's mercy toward them? I, even I, am he who yet blotteth out thy transgressions. This encourages us to repent, because there is forgiveness with God, and shows the freeness of Divine mercy. When God forgives, he forgets. It is not for any thing in us, but for his mercies' sake, his promise' sake; especially for his Son's sake. He is pleased to reckon it his honour. Would man justify himself before God? The attempt is desperate: our first father broke the covenant, and we all have copied his example. We have no reason to expect pardon, except we seek it by faith in Christ; and that is always attended by true repentance, and followed by newness of life, by hatred of sin, and love to God. Let us then put him in remembrance of the promises he has made to the penitent, and the satisfaction his Son has made for them. Plead these with him in wrestling for pardon; and declare these things, that thou mayest be justified freely by his grace. This is the only way, and it is a sure way to peace.</body></html>
