There were, perhaps, special troubles to be endured connected with the final Babylonian struggle. There were certainly others connected with the tedious and dangerous journey from Babylonia to Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>). There were others, again, after the Holy Land was reached, arising out of the jealousy and ill will of neighbouring nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4</a>. and 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4.htm">Nehemiah 4-6</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee</span>. The literal fulfilment in the persons of the "three children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a>) will be obvious to every reader. But the prophecy has, no doubt, a far wider scope. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-7 God's favour and good-will to his people speak abundant comfort to all believers. The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be against them. What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people. Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again dissuades from anxious fears.</body></html>
