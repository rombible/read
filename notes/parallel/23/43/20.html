The recent mention of the desert causes animals of the desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21, 22</a>) to be taken as examples. (On the animals intended, see the comment on Isaiah 34:13.) If even the beasts of the desert honoured God, much more would the rest of the animal creation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:14-21 The deliverance from Babylon is foretold, but there is reference to greater events. The redemption of sinners by Christ, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described. All that is to be done to rescue sinners, and to bring the believer to glory, is little, compared with that wondrous work of love, the redemption of man.</body></html>
