The old deliverance will be as nothing compared with the new. Israel must cast its eye forwards, not backwards. Mr. Cheyne well compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7, 8</a>, and also well notes that "the chief glories of the second manifestation are spiritual." Israel in the wilderness was a stiff:necked and rebellious people, given to murmuring, licentiousness, and idolatry. Israel, returned from Babylon, will no more hanker after idols, but will have God's Law "put in their inward parts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-33.htm">Jeremiah 32:33</a>), and will "show forth God's praise" (ver. 21). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:14-21 The deliverance from Babylon is foretold, but there is reference to greater events. The redemption of sinners by Christ, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described. All that is to be done to rescue sinners, and to bring the believer to glory, is little, compared with that wondrous work of love, the redemption of man.</body></html>
