Their calling and election had not been cancelled, and they might yet fulfil it. They, in that restoration from exile which Isaiah had foretold, should be a living proof of the foresight granted to the prophets, and, therefore, of the foreknowledge of Him who alone could say, "I am He," to whom past, present, and future were as one; and He, the Eternal, proclaims Himself as being also the only Saviour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are my witnesses</span>, <span class="cmt_word">saith the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Ye, Israel, are the witnesses that I cite" - ye can prove the antiquity of the historical books of Scripture by the ordinary modes by which antiquity is proved, and also the exact dates of the prophetical sues. Ye can show what clear and unambiguous prophecies have been delivered centuries before the event, as the destruction of Jerusalem by a nation in whom none can fail to recognize the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-57</a>), prophesied by Moses; the demolition of the altar at Bethel by a king of the house of David, Josiah by name, prophesied by a man of God in the reign of Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>); the long continuance of David's progeny upon the throne of Judah, prophesied by Nathan in David's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>); the fairly long continuance of the house of Jehu on the throne of Israel, prophesied to Jehu himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>); and the like. Israel has been at all times, and still is, one of the most important witnesses for God that exists in the world. Like the Church, Israel is the "witness and keeper" of a large portion of "Holy Writ." Her past history witnesses for God. Her continued existence and present condition constitute additional testimony. <span class="cmt_word">And my Servant whom I have chosen</span>. To explain this as meaning "and ye are also my servant, whom I have chosen" (Nagelsbach, Cheyne, Delitzsch), is to empty it of all its force. Manifestly, a further witness is adduced, "Ye are my witnesses; and so is my Servant," etc. The "Servant" intended can only be the one true Servant of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>, since faithful Israel is already among the witnesses. The prophet rises above the consideration of the immediately present, or of the single trial-scene which he is setting before us, and has in mind the great controversy ever going on between those who are for God and those who are against him. He sees, on the side of God <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> faithful Israel: and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ, the "Faithful Witness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>), who "came into the world that he should bear witness of the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). These are the two witnesses by whom God's truth is maintained in a world of falsehood and delusion. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may know</span>. The subject is changed. "Ye" here points to "the nations," or mankind at large. I am he (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before me there was no God formed</span>. All other gods beside me are "formed" gods - invented, fashioned, made by men. None of them was ever made before me. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside me there is no saviour</span>. None but God can save men. Man cannot make atonement for his fellows; "for it cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for ever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>, Prayer-book Version). The human "saviours" whom God raises up to deliver his people out of the hand of their enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>, etc.), are "saviours" in quite a secondary and inferior sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:8-13 Idolaters are called to appear in defence of their idols. Those who make them, and trust in them, are like unto them. They have the shape and faculties of men; but they have not common sense. But God's people know the power of his grace, the sweetness of his comforts, the kind care of his providence, and the truth of his promise. All servants of God can give such an account of what he has wrought in them, and done for them, as may lead others to know and believe his power, truth, and love</body></html>
