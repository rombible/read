Thy Saviour. He who had saved them front Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-31</a>), from Jabin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>.), from Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.), from the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>), from Zerah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), from Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>). The term is first used of God by David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-21.htm">Psalm 106:21</a> (if that psalm be Davidical). It is also applied to God once in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>), and once in Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>). With Isaiah, in these later chapters it is a favourite epithet, being used of God no fewer than eight times (see ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-8.htm">Isaiah 63:8</a>) With his eye fixed on the deliverance of Israel out of the double captivity of sin and of Babylon, he naturally had much before him this aspect of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">I gave Egypt for thy ransom</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">I have given</span>; that is to say, "In my counsels I have already assigned to the Persians, as compensation for their letting thee go free, the broad countries of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba." Even the latest date assigned by sceptical critics to "the Second Isaiah" would make this a most remarkable prophecy. Egypt was not reduced, nor was Ethiopia made tributary to Persia until several years after the death of Cyrus, whose son, Cambyses, effected the conquests about <span class="date">B.C. 527-6</span>. Human foresight could not, in the lifetime of Cyrus, have predicted with any certainty what would be the result of collision between Egypt and Persia; much less could it have ventured on the improbable supposition that the remote Ethiopia would submit itself to the Achae-menisn yoke. Yet this was the result of the invasion of Cambyses, who made Egypt a Persian province, and forced the Ethiopians to submit to the payment of an annual tribute (see Herod., 3:97; 7:69). <span class="cmt_word">And Seba</span>. If "Seba" is "the land of Meroe, which is enclosed between the White and Blue Niles" (Delitzsch), it may be questioned whether really this ever formed a portion of the Persian empire. But Isaiah has probably no very distinct knowledge of the geographical position of Seba, or of the relations between the Sabaeans and the rest of the Ethiopians. He couples the two together, both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, as forming two portions of one nation. The subjection of the Ethiopians involves, in his eyes, the subjection of the Sabaeans. And we cannot say that he is wrong, since it is not at all clear that the Sabaeans were not generally spread through Ethiopia, or at any rate scattered in various parts of the country. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-7 God's favour and good-will to his people speak abundant comfort to all believers. The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be against them. What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people. Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again dissuades from anxious fears.</body></html>
