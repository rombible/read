Jehovah has created Israel as specially answering, as other created things did, to an archetype in His own purpose. To "call by name<span class= "ital">" </span>is everywhere, but pre-eminently in the East, the mark of an individualising tenderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>), almost of a predestinating love that makes the name a witness of its purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - A RENEWED PROMISE TO ISRAEL OF PROTECTION AND DELIVERANCE. Severe rebuke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-25</a>) is followed, as so often in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-16</a>, etc.), by comfort and consolation. Israel is assured that God has not cast him off, and promised the comfort of the Divine presence during the existing tribulation (ver. 2), and. a speedy restoration to Palestine (vers. 3-7). The scattered Israelites will be brought together from all quarters by the Divine omnipoteney. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span>. The words mark the strong contrast between the closing passage of the preceding chapter and the opening paragraph of the present one. Israel had undergone a severe punishment for his sins; he is still suffering, <span class="accented">but now</span> there is going to be an entire change. He is to be protected and delivered. <span class="cmt_word">Created thee... formed. thee redeemed thee... called thee by thy name.</span> An ascending series of benefits. First, creation, like that of formless matter out of nought; then, formation, or putting of the formless matter into shape; thirdly, redemption, or making them all his own; lastly, calling them by their name, and so conferring on them a proud and enviable distinction. On this fourfold ground God claims Israel as his own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:1-7 God's favour and good-will to his people speak abundant comfort to all believers. The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be against them. What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people. Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again dissuades from anxious fears.</body></html>
