The "present," interpreted after the manner of the East, would seem almost like an acknowledgment of Hezekiah's <span class= "ital">hegemony, </span>or even <span class= "ital">suzerainty, </span>in such a confederacy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>, where it appears that a part of the business of the ambassadors was to inquire concerning the astronomical marvel which had recently occurred in the land). The embassy probably followed the illness of Hezekiah within a year. <span class="cmt_word">Merodach-Baladan</span>. This is a more correct form than the "Berodach-Baladan" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>. The name is one common to several Babylonian kings, as to one who reigned about <span class="date">B.C. 1325</span>, to a second who is placed about <span class="date">B.C. 900</span>, and to a third who was contemporary with the Assyrian kings Sargon and Sennacherib. It is this last of whom we have a notice in the present passage. He appears first in the Assyrian inscriptions as a petty prince, ruling a small tract upon the seacoast, about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates. Tiglath-Pileser takes tribute front him about <span class="date">B.C. 744</span>. In <span class="date">B.C. 721</span> we find him advanced to a more prominent position. Taking advantage of the troubles of the time, he shakes off the Assyrians yoke, and makes himself King of Babylon, where he has a reign of twelve years - from <span class="date">B.C. 721</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>. This reign is recognized by Sargon in his inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and by the Greek chronologist, Ptolemy, in his 'Canon.' In <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> Sargon leads an expedition against him, and drives him out of Babylonia into the coast-tract, Chaldea, where he besieges him in his ancestral town Bit-Yakin, takes the city, and makes him prisoner (ibid., p. 15). On the death of Sargon, in <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, Merodach-Baladan escapes from confinement, and hastens once more to Babylon, where he is acknowledged as king, and has a second reign, which lasts six months (Alex. Polyhist. ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1. 5. &sect; 1). He is then driven from the country by Sennacherib, and, after various vicissitudes, obliged to become a refugee in Elam (G. Smith, 'Hist. of Babylonia,' pp. 125-128). The name of Merodach-Baladau is composed of the three elements, <span class="accented">Merodach</span> (equivalent to "Mar-duk"), the god, <span class="accented">bal</span> or <span class="accented">pal</span>, "son," and <span class="accented">iddina</span>, "has given," and thus signifies "Merodach has given (me) a son." <span class="cmt_word">The son of Baladan</span>. "Baladan" is scarcely a possible Babylonian name. "Beladan" would, however, be quite possible, being a name formed on the model of Ishtardddin ('Eponym Canon,' p. 30), Ninip-iddin (p. 35), Ilu-iddin (p. 57), etc. And the corruption of Beladan into Baladan would be easy. Merodach-Baladan III. is called by Sargon "the son of Yakin;" but this is perhaps a tribal or local rather than a personal name. Compare Jehu's appellation of "son of Omri" (ibid., p. 114). <span class="cmt_word">Sent letters and a present to Hezekiah</span>. Hezekiah's fourteenth year was <span class="date">B.C. 714</span>. Merodach-Baladan had then been King of Babylon for eight years, and, knowing that he might at any time be attacked by Sargon, was naturally looking out for alliances with other powers, which Assyria equally threatened. He had recently concluded a treaty with Khumbanigas, King of Elam ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and had obtained the support of several of the Aramaean tribes on the Euphrates. He now apparently thought that Judaea, which Sargon was also threatening (ch. 38:6), might be induced to join him. Hezekiah's illness and "the wonder done in the land" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>) furnished him with pretexts for an embassy, which probably had more serious objects than either congratulation or scientific inquiry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-8 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 20:12-19.</body></html>
