Daniel and his three companions were "of the king's seed and of the princes," and were, probably, themselves reduced to that state, placed under the care of <span class= "ital">"</span>the master of the ennuchs" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-3.htm" title="And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;">Daniel 1:3</a>). The actual treasures which Hezekiah showed were probably handed over to Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/18-15.htm" title="And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.">2Kings 18:15-16</a>); but looking to the fact that that king records his capture of Babylon, after defeating Merodach-baladan, and established his son Esar-haddon there (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Ancient History, </span>i., p. 400), it is probable enough that the treasures may have been taken thither, and displayed, as if in irony, to the king and the counsellors, who had hoped to profit by them. Sennacherib indeed boasts that he had carried off not only the king's treasures, and his musicians to Nineveh, but his daughters also (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 63).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the days come</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the days</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">coming</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">approaching.</span> Of the exact "times and seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), the prophets generally knew nothing. They were mouth-pieces, to declare the Divine will, not keen-witted politicians, forecasting results by the exercise of sharp-sightedness and sagacity. To suppose that Isaiah foresaw by mere human wisdom the Babylonian conquest of Judaea, as Charles the Great did the ravages of the Northmen (R. Williams, 'Hebrew Prophets,' vol. 1. p. 429), is to give him credit for a sagacity quite unexampled and psychologically impossible. The kingdom of Babylon was one among many that were struggling hard to maintain independence against the grasping and encroaching Assyria. From the time of Tiglath-Pileser IX. she had been continually losing ground. Both Sargon and Sennacherib trampled her underfoot, overran her territory, captured her towns, and reduced her under direct Assyrian government. Till Assyria should be swept away, a Babylonian conquest of Palestine was impossible. To suppose it was like supposing a Russian conquest of Holland, while Germany bars the way. Nothing short of the true prophetic afflatus, which is God the Holy Ghost speaking by the mouth of his servants, could have made such an anticipation. And with Isaiah, as Mr. Cheyne says, it is "not a mere presentiment; it is a calm and settled conviction, based on a direct revelation, and confirmed by a deep insight into the laws of the Divine government." <span class="cmt_word">All that is in thine house</span>. Not, of course, exactly all that was there when Isaiah spoke, but all the wealth that should be in the royal palace when the time of the Babylonian captivity arrived. (For the fulfilment, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">That which thy fathers have laid up in store</span>. A portion of this was carried off by Sennacherib in his first expedition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>); but the bulk of the temple treasures - the gifts of many kings - remained untouched until they were removed to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-8 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 20:12-19.</body></html>
