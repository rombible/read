but this, as we have seen, is at variance with both the received and the rectified chronology. The display was obviously something more than the ostentation of a Cr?sus showing his treasures to Solon (Herod. i. 3). It was practically a display of the resources of the kingdom, intended to impress the Babylonian ambassadors with a sense of his importance as an ally.<p><span class= "bld">The spices, and the precious ointment . . .</span>--The mention of these articles as part of the king's treasures is characteristic of the commerce and civilisation of the time. "Spices"--probably myrrh, gumbenzoin, cinnamon--had from a very early period been among the gifts offered to princes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm" title="And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.">1Kings 10:10</a>). The "ointment," or perfumed oil, finds its parallel in the costly unguent of the Gospel history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-7.htm" title="There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.">Matthew 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>). Esar-haddon's account of the magnificence of his palace (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iii.</span>, 122) supplies a contemporary instance of like ostentation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah was glad of them</span>. A more pregnant phrase than that which replaces it in 2 Kings, "hearkened unto them." Hezekiah, like Merodach-Baladan, was looking out for allies, and "was glad," thinking that in Babylon he had found one which might render him important service. Sargon's promptness, however, frustrated his hopes. In <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> that prince, regarding Merodach-Baladan's proceedings as constituting a real danger to his kingdom, made a great expedition into Babylonia, defeated Merodach-Baladan, and took him prisoner, after which he had himself crowned King of Babylon, and during the remainder of his life ( <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> to 705) ruled both countries. <span class="cmt_word">Showed them the house of his precious things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his treasury, or store-house. The treasuries of ancient monarchs were actual <span class="accented">store-chambers</span>, in which large quantities of the precious metals and valuable objects of various kinds were deposited (see Herod., 2:121; Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 3:16, 18, etc.). The flourishing state of the treasury is an indication that the events here narrated are anterior to the great surrender of treasure to Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>; 'Epenym Canon,' p. 135). <span class="cmt_word">All the house of his armour</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). If a warlike alliance was contemplated, it was as important to show the possession of arms as of treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. We must allow for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is, that, without any reserve, Hezekiah showed all that he could show. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-8 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 20:12-19.</body></html>
