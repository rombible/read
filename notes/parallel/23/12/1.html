He has been taught that confession must be blended with thanksgiving--that those only can rightly estimate the comfort which God gives who have first felt His wrath. The fact that the prophet appears as a psalmist was a natural result of the training of the schools of the prophets, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20</a>, possibly also of his familiarity with the Temple service as a priest or Levite. The group of psalms ascribed to the sons of Korah presents so many parallelisms to the writings of Isaiah, and so obviously belongs to the same period, that we may reasonably think of him as having been associated with that goodly company.

On each of her deliverances the Church is hound to praise God. In some parts of the Church it is customary on every such occasion to sing a "Te Deum." The ordinary Israelite hymn of praise appears to have been the hundred and thirty-sixth psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34, 41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>; 1 Macc. 4:24); but on extraordinary occasions special thanksgivings were sung (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>; 1 Samuel 7:18-29, etc.). Isaiah is now inspired to give a pattern song, suitable for the Church to sing when she is reunited, enlarged, and restored to favor. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. In the day of deliverance and restoration. <span class="cmt_word">Though thou wast angry</span>; literally, <span class="accented">because thou wast angry</span>. Kay understands an actual hank-fullness for the severe discipline, which had checked them, and not allowed them to glide on smoothly to ruin. But perhaps the idiom is rather that of the passage, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), where it is only the last clause that expresses the true object of the thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Comfortedst</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hast comforted</span>, since the effect continued. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:10-16 When the gospel should be publicly preached, the Gentiles would seek Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and find rest of soul. When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.</body></html>
