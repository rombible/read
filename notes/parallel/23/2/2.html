and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-3</a>, with the addition of a verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-4.htm" title="But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken it.">Micah 4:4</a>) which describes the prosperity of Judah--every man sitting "under his vine and his fig-tree," as in the days of Solomon. Whether (1) Isaiah borrowed from Micah, or (2) Micah from Isaiah, or (3) both from some earlier prophet, or (4) whether each received an independent yet identical revelation, is a problem which we have no adequate data for solving. Micah prophesied, like Isaiah, under Ahaz, Jotham, and Hezekiah, and so either may have heard it from the other. On the other hand, the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem, on which these verses follow, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>, appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm" title="Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.">Jeremiah 26:18</a> to have been spoken in the days of Hezekiah. On the whole, (3) seems to have most to commend it. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p>For "in the last days" read <span class= "ital">latter </span>or <span class= "ital">after days</span>; the idea of the Hebrew words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm" title="And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm" title="And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.">Numbers 24:14</a>, being that of remoteness rather than finality. For the most part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-30.htm" title="When you are in tribulation, and all these things are come on you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the LORD your God, and shall be obedient to his voice;">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-29.htm" title="For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.">Deuteronomy 31:29</a>) they point to the distant future of the true King, to the time of the Messiah.<p><span class= "bld">The mountain of the Lord's house.</span>--The prophet's vision of the far-off days sees, as it were, a transfigured and glorified Jerusalem. Zion, with the Temple, was to be no longer surrounded by hills as high as, or higher than, itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a>), scorned by other mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/68-16.htm" title="Why leap you, you high hills? this is the hill which God desires to dwell in; yes, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.">Psalm 68:16-17</a>); but was to be to Israel as a Sinai or a Lebanon, as a Mount Meru, or an Olympus, "an exceeding high mountain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), whose physical elevation should answer to its spiritual. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>.) So in that vision of the future, the waters of Shiloah, that went softly, were to become a broad and rushing river (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm" title="But there the glorious LORD will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.">Isaiah 33:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-3.htm" title="And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.">Ezekiel 47:3-12</a>). So, when men had been taught by experience that this ideal was to be realised in no Jerusalem or earth, the seer of Patmos saw a yet more transcendent vision of the glories of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm" title="And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,">Revelation 21:10</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>), and yet even these were but types and figures of divine and ineffable realities.<p><span class= "bld">All nations shall flow unto it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">all the nations</span>--i.e., the heathen as distinct from Israel. The prophet sees and welcomes the approach of pilgrims from all regions of the earth to the new sanctuary. Thus early in his work was Isaiah (half unconsciously as to the manner in which his vision was to be realised) the prophet of a universal religion, of which the truths of Judaism were the centre, and of a catholic Church. In the admission of proselytes, commemorated in Psalms 87 (probably written about this time), we may see what may either have suggested the prophecy, or have seemed as the first-fruits of its fulfilment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - PROPHECY OF THE LAST DAYS. The resemblance of this prophecy to <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-3</a> is so close as to necessitate the conclusion either that one of the two prophets copied from the other, or that both copied from an earlier document. The latter view, which is that taken by Rosenm&uuml;ller, Maurer, De Wette, Meier, and Mr. Cheyne, seems preferable. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the last days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the sequel of the days</span>; but generally used of a remote future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The mountain of the Lord's house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Church, the true Zion, which is to be the antitype of the existing Zion, and is therefore given its material attributes. Spiritually, it would be a "mountain," as "a city set on a hill," which "could not be hid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>); and again, as occupying a position from which it would command the whole earth. <span class="cmt_word">In the top of the mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">at the head of the mountains</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with pre-eminence over them. The metaphor is drawn from the common physical fact of a high mountain range culminating in a single supreme eminence. So Mount Hermon towers above the rest of the Antilibanus, Demavend over Elburz, Rowandiz over Zagros. The "mountains" above which the true Zion shall tower are the kingdoms, or perhaps the religions, of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">All nations</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the nations of the earth" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall flow</span>; or, <span class="accented">stream</span>. A constant accession of converts from all quarters is intended. These are represented as continually streaming upward into the holy mountain of God's house. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?</body></html>
