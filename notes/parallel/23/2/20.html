It is perhaps significant that the animals thus named were proverbial for their blindness and love of darkness.

The African beats his fetish on such occasions. The Israelites would fling theirs to the moles and the bats. <span class="cmt_word">Idols of silver... idols of gold</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4</a>: 135:15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-7.htm">Isaiah 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>). A passage of Habakkuk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>) shows that sometimes the main bulk of the idol was of stone, which was overlaid with a coating of one or other of the two precious metals; but it would seem that ordinarily the entire image was either of gold or silver (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>).

The metaphor must not be pressed. They would throw the idols into holes and corners, pits and caverns, where moles and bats might be expected to be the only visitants. Some idea of the <span class="accented">blindness</span> implied in any regard for idols may have prompted the imagery. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 The taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans seems first meant here, when idolatry among the Jews was done away; but our thoughts are led forward to the destruction of all the enemies of Christ. It is folly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hide or shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will be terrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of God depriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of the Lord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence. Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shall be frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but the time will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This whole passage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready to leave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely on their heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease from depending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let not man be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in the Lord your God. Let us make this our great concern.</body></html>
