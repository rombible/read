The first fact is the most weighty argument against it, but is not decisive. The other objection does not count for much. To "cease from man" as well as from "idols" is surely the natural close of the great discourse which had begun with proclaiming that men of all classes and conditions should be brought low. The words "whose breath is in his nostrils" emphasise the frailty of human life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-22.htm" title="All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.">Genesis 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/146-3.htm" title="Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.">Psalm 146:3-4</a>). Looking to that frailty, the prophet asks, as the psalmist had asked, "What is man? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm" title="O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth! who have set your glory above the heavens.">Psalm 8:1</a>). What is he to be valued at?" If it could be proved that the verse was not Isaiah's, it is at least the reflection of a devout mind in harmony with his.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cease ye from man</span>. This verse is regarded by many as a late marginal note, which has accidentally crept into the text (Diestel, Studer, Cheyne). It is omitted in the Septuagint, and interrupts the sequence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3</a>. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2</a>. somewhat awkwardly. If retained, it must be regarded as an appeal to Israel on the part of the prophet to give up their trust in man, whence had flowed all their other errors. <span class="cmt_word">Whose breath is in his nostrils</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "whose life is a mere breath; who, if he ceases to breathe, ceases to live." <span class="cmt_word">For wherein is he to be accounted of?</span> or, <span class="accented">for of what account is he?</span> Surely, of no account at all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 The taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans seems first meant here, when idolatry among the Jews was done away; but our thoughts are led forward to the destruction of all the enemies of Christ. It is folly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hide or shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will be terrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of God depriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of the Lord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence. Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shall be frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but the time will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This whole passage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready to leave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely on their heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease from depending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let not man be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in the Lord your God. Let us make this our great concern.</body></html>
