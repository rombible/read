(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a>.) The "ways" and the "paths" are the great laws of righteousness, which lead to the eternal life. The verb for "teach" is the root of the Hebrew for "law," as the "teaching" of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">Shall go forth the law </span>. . .--In the preaching of the Christ, in the mission of the Twelve, in the whole history of the Apostolic Church, we have, to say the least, an adequate fulfilment of the promise. The language of St. Paul, however, suggests that there may be in the future a yet more glorious mission, of which Jerusalem shall once more be the centre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12-15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">many peoples</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Shall go</span>; or, <span class="accented">set forth</span>. The prophet means to represent the nations as encouraging one another on the way. There is no jealousy among them, for the "mountain" can hold them all. <span class="cmt_word">He will teach us</span>. The nations feel their ignorance of God, and their need of "teaching." God alone can teach them concerning himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10, 11</a>); and "he will teach" them, either directly, as the Incarnate Son, or indirectly through those whom he has appointed to be "teachers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of his ways</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "some of his ways," not "all of them;" for at present "we know in part" only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-9.htm">1 Corinthians 13:9</a>), and the greater portion of his ways are "past finding out" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). The "ways" here spoken of are, no doubt, rules for the conduct of life, which are practically inexhaustible. God, however, will teach every man, who honestly seeks to learn, enough to enable him to "walk in his paths." <span class="cmt_word">Out of Zion shall go forth the Law</span>; rather, <span class="accented">instruction</span>, or <span class="accented">teaching</span>. The word (<span class="accented">torah</span>) is without the article. The instruction intended is that of the Church of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?</body></html>
