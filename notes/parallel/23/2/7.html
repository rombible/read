Chariots were used probably both for state pageants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-9.htm" title="I have compared you, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.">Song of Solomon 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/3-9.htm" title="King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.">Song of Solomon 3:9-10</a>) and as part of the <span class= "ital">materiel </span>of war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm" title="And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm" title="And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 9:25</a>). Isaiah here also agrees with Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm" title="O you inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.">Micah 1:13</a>) in looking on this as "the beginning of sin" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1Samuel 8:11</a>). For him, as for Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>), the true King was to come, not with chariots and horses, but riding, as the judges of Israel had ridden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm" title="Speak, you that ride on white asses, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>), on "a colt, the foal of an ass."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Full of silver and gold</span>. The results of the commercial activity - not evil things in themselves, but probably acquired by sharp dealing, and leading to undue softness and luxury. The Law had given a warning against "greatly multiplying silver and gold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>). For the fact of the vast abundance of the precious metals in Judaea at this time, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-16.htm">2 Kings 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>; and compare Sennacherib's inscription on the Taylor Cylinder ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 163, 2nd edit.). <span class="cmt_word">Full of horses... chariots</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>). There is no reason to believe that the Jews or Israelites ever possessed (unless it were under Solomon) any considerable cavalry or chariot force. But from the time of David horses and chariots were imported for convenience and for show by the kings, the princes, and the nobles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:7</a>). Like the silver and the gold, they were signs of luxury and ostentation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?</body></html>
