In that storm which is about to burst over the land, the cedars and the oaks, and, we may add, those who were as the cedars and the oaks, in their pride and glory, should all alike be shattered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon all the cedars of Lebanon</span>. It is usual to take this metaphorically; and no doubt men are often compared to trees in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-16.htm">Job 8:16, 17</a>), and "cedars of Lebanon" especially are symbols of the great and proud ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>). But it has been well observed that either <span class="accented">all</span> the details of the description in the text must be taken literally, or <span class="accented">all</span> of them metaphorically, and that the mention of such objects as "ships of Tarshish" and "pleasant pictures" pleads strongly for a literal interpretation. The day of the Lord was upon the cedars when Sennacherib "with chariots upon chariots came up to the height of the mountains, to the <span class="accented">sides of Lebanon</span>, and <span class="accented">cut down the tall cedars thereof</span>, and the choice fir trees thereof" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>); and similar devastation accompanied, it is probable, the other invasions of the Assyrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 474, 475). <span class="cmt_word">Upon all the oaks of Bashan</span>. The "oaks of Bashan" are celebrated also by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>) and by Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a>). It is quite likely that the Assyrians cut timber in Bashan, as they did in Lebanon and Amanus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 The taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans seems first meant here, when idolatry among the Jews was done away; but our thoughts are led forward to the destruction of all the enemies of Christ. It is folly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hide or shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will be terrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of God depriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of the Lord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence. Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shall be frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but the time will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This whole passage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready to leave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely on their heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease from depending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let not man be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in the Lord your God. Let us make this our great concern.</body></html>
