Having shown to Israel the vision of a far-distant future, when holiness and peace would reign upon the earth, and "the mountain of the Lord's house" would draw all men into it, the prophet returns to things as they are - first exhorting Israel to "walk in the light of Jehovah' (ver. 5), and then showing how far they have withdrawn from the light; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by magical practices (ver. 6); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by commercial greed (vers. 6, 7); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by ostentation and luxury (ver. 7); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> by idolatry (ver. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such being the case, punishment must come - mean and great must be equally brought low (ver. 9) - the people must fly to their cave-fastnesses (ver. 10), and hide themselves; they must be humiliated to the uttermost (ver. 11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O house of Jacob</span>. "House of Jacob" is the common expression in Isaiah, instead of "house of Israel" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a>). It has no particular force, merely signifying "Israelites." <span class="cmt_word">Come ye, and let us walk.</span> The same words as those of the "nations" in ver. 3, "Come ye, and let us go up." As the nations will invite each other "in the last days," so the prophet now invites his countrymen to walk with God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?</body></html>
