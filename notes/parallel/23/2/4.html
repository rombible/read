In reliance on His wisdom and equity, nations would refer their disputes to His decision instead of the arbitrament of war. Here again we have a partial fulfilment, it may be hoped, a "springing and germinant accomplishment," in the history of Christendom. So far as the teaching of Christ has influenced international polity and law, He has been the supreme arbitrator of their disputes.<p><span class= "bld">And they shall beat their swords into plowshares.</span>--The words invert the picture of an earlier prophet, who spoke of a time of war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm" title="Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.">Joel 3:10</a>). Isaiah must have known that prediction, and yet he proclaims (following <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm" title="And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.">Hosea 2:18</a>) that peace, not war, is the ideal goal towards which the order of the Divine government is tending. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm" title="And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.">Zechariah 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall judge among the nations</span>. This is clearly not yet fulfilled. How God shall ultimately "judge among the nations," or rather "between nation and nation," is a mystery which only the future can reveal. It has been supposed that "by his providential retributions he will decide those international questions out of which war ordinarily springs" (Kay). But it would seem to be at least as likely that he will bring the nations to such a pitch of wisdom and moderation, that they will voluntarily discard war, and agree to decide any disputes that arise by means of arbiters. The arbiter would then, like other judges, represent God, and "by him decree justice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall rebuke</span>. Rosenm&uuml;ller translates, "Arbiter pacts sit;" Cheyne, "shall arbitrate." Here again, as in ver. 3, "people" should be "peoples." <span class="cmt_word">They shall beat</span>, etc. On a sudden call to war, nations "beat their ploughshares into swords, and their pruning-hooks into spears" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>). They will do the reverse "in the latter days," when God shall have "made wars to cease" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>) and "speak peace unto the nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?</body></html>
