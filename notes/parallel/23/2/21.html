As men feel shock after shock of the earthquake, and see the flashing fires, and hear the crash of the thunder, they leave the larger caverns in which they had at first sought shelter, and where they have left the idols that were once so precious, and fly to the smaller and higher openings, the "clefts of the rocks," and the <span class= "ital">rents of the crags, </span>in their unspeakable panic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To go into</span>; or, <span class="accented">as they go into</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "as they make their escape, they shall fling the idols away." <span class="cmt_word">The clefts of the rocks</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>, the only other passage of Scripture where the word occurs). <span class="cmt_word">The tops of the ragged rocks</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the rents</span>, or <span class="accented">crevices</span>.

It is folly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hide or shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will be terrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of God depriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of the Lord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence. Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shall be frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but the time will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This whole passage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready to leave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely on their heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease from depending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let not man be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in the Lord your God. Let us make this our great concern.</body></html>
