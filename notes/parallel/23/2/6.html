Jehovah "went not forth" with the armies of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm" title="O God, when you went forth before your people, when you did march through the wilderness; Selah:">Psalm 68:7</a>); and the Syrians, Edomites, and Philistines, possibly the Assyrians also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.">2Chronicles 28:17-20</a>), were laying the lands waste.<p><span class= "bld">Because they be replenished from the east.</span>--The disasters of the time are viewed as chastisements for sin, and the sin consisted in casting off their national allegiance to Jehovah.

There was, as it were, a mania for divination, and the "diviners" of Philistia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-2.htm" title="And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us with which we shall send it to his place.">1Samuel 6:2</a>) found imitators among the people of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">They please themselves in the children of strangers.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">they strike hands with, </span>as meaning, (1) they enter into contracts with, or (2) they make common cause with.

It was probably conducted, as at an earlier date, chiefly by Phoenician sailors and merchants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-27.htm" title="And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.">1Kings 9:27</a>), and thus opened the way to their impurity of worship and of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm" title="Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.">Jonah 1:5</a>). The sense of being a peculiar and separate people wore away. The pictures of the "strange woman" and the foreign money-lender of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-3.htm" title="For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:">Proverbs 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,">Proverbs 6:1</a>, present two aspects of this evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for</span>. The prophet, in calling upon Israel to "walk in the light of the Lord," implies that they are not so walking. He then proceeds to give the reasons of this. They are not, "for God has forsaken them, or, cast them off." The first reason is <span class="cmt_word">because they be replenished from the east</span> (Revised Version, "they be filled <span class="accented">with customs</span> from the east); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they have adopted a number of Syrian, Assyrian, and Ammonite superstitions; e.g. high places, images, and "groves," the burning of their children in honor of Moloch, the use of divination and enchantment, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-12, 16, 17</a>, etc.). Most of these practices reached the Israelites from Syria, though many had their origin either in Assyria or Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">Soothsayers</span>, <span class="cmt_word">like the Philistines.</span> The "diviners" of the Philistines are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-2.htm">1 Samuel 6:2</a>. By the word here employed, it would seem that they foretold the future from observations on the clouds and the general appearance of the sky. During the reign of Uzziah, the Israelites had been brought into closer contact with the Philistines than usual, through his conquest of several of their cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They please themselves in the children of strangers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">strike hands with the children of strangers</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>). This is thought to refer to striking hands upon a bargain (Cheyne), and to be an allusion to the commercial activity of the reigns of Uzziah and Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>). But perhaps it does not mean more than familiarity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?</body></html>
