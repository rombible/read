The "ships of Tarshish" had come to be used generically for all ships of the class used in such commerce, whether crossing the Mediterranean to Spain, or circumnavigating Africa, or passing over the Persian Gulf to Ophir.<p><span class= "bld">Upon all pleasant pictures.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">upon all imagery of delight </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm" title="Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:">Numbers 33:52</a>.) The combination of the phrase with "the ships of Tarshish" suggests the inference that it includes the works of art which were brought by them from East and West. For these, it would seem, there was a mania among the higher classes in Jerusalem, like that which in later times has fastened upon china, or pictures, or carvings in ivory. So the ships of Solomon brought gold and silver, and "ivory and apes and peacocks" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm" title="For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">1Kings 10:22</a>). The "ivory beds" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4</a>, the "gold rings set with the beryl," the "ivory overlaid with sapphires," the "pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/5-14.htm" title="His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.">Song of Solomon 5:14-15</a>, the precious things in the treasury of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-2.htm" title="And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.">Isaiah 39:2</a>), may be taken as examples of this form of luxury. The aestheticism of the Roman Empire, of the <span class= "ital">Renaissance </span>of the fifteenth century, of the age of Louis XIV., of our own time and country, presents obvious parallels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the ships of Tarshish.</span> "Ships of Tarshish" meant originally "ships built to sail to Tarshish;" but was used by the later writers for ships of a certain class or size (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>). Tarshish was Tartessus, in Spain, and voyages thither were regarded as long and dangerous (Herod., 1:163). Consequently, the ships which were built for the Tartessian trade were of unusual size and strength. Uzziah had "built [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> rebuilt] Elath," in the eastern arm of the Red Sea, early in his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), and no doubt maintained a fleet there, as Jehoshaphat had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). Elath remained in the possession of the Jews till the reign of Ahaz, when it was taken by Rezin, and restored to Edom (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon all pleasant pictures</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">all pleasant imagery</span>. The exact word here translated "pictures" does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament; but a cognate word is not uncommon. From the passages in which this cognate word occurs (especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>), it is concluded that works of art, of some sort or other, are intended. More than this can scarcely be determined. Dr. Kay thinks the term to include "sculptures and fresco-paintings." Mr. Cheyne translates "all delightful works of imagery." The sentiment is that the judgment of God will fall on the most valued contents of palaces and grand houses, no less than upon the forests and the mountains, the fortified places, and the national navy. <span class="accented">All</span> wilt be involved in one sweeping destruction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 The taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans seems first meant here, when idolatry among the Jews was done away; but our thoughts are led forward to the destruction of all the enemies of Christ. It is folly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hide or shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will be terrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of God depriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of the Lord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence. Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shall be frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but the time will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This whole passage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready to leave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely on their heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease from depending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let not man be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in the Lord your God. Let us make this our great concern.</body></html>
