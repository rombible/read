awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?">Isaiah 51:9</a>. There they were addressed to the arm of Jehovah, and were the prelude of a glorious promise. Here they are spoken to Jerusalem as a drunken and desperate castaway, and introduce a painfully vivid picture of her desolation. They seem, indeed, prefixed to that picture to make it bearable. They are a call to Zion to wake out of that drunken sleep, and therefore show that her ruin is not irretrievable.<p><span class= "bld">The dregs of the</span> <span class= "bld">cup.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the goblet cup, </span>but with the sense, as in the Authorised version, of the cup being drained.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-23.</span> - AN ADDRESS OF THE PROPHET TO JERUSALEM. The comfort afforded to Israel generally is now concentrated on Jerusalem. Her condition during the long period of the Captivity is deplored, and her want of a champion to assert her cause and raise her out of the dust is lamented (vers. 17-20). After this, an assurance is given her that the miseries which she has suffered shall pass from her to her great enemy, by whom the dregs of the "cup of trembling" shall be drained, and the last drop wrung out (vers. 21-23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, awake</span> (comp. ver. 9 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>). Isaiah marks the breaks in his prophecy, sometimes by a repetition of terminal clauses, which have the effect of a refrain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a>; and Isaiah 48:22; 57:21); sometimes by a repetition of initial clauses of a striking character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 11, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1, 12, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4, 7, 9</a>, etc.). Here we have thrice over "Awake, awake" - not, however, an exact repetition in the Hebrew, but a near approach to it each summons forming the commencement of a new paragraph or subsection<span class="cmt_word">. Which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury.</span> The cup of God's fury was poured out on Jerusalem when the city was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, the temple, the royal palace, and the houses of the nobles burnt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>), the walls broken down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>), and the bulk of the inhabitants carried away captive to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-25.htm">2 Chronicles 34:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-31.htm">Ezekiel 22:31</a>, etc.). "The cup of God's fury" is an expression used by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). The dregs of the cup; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">the goblet-cup</span> (Cheyne), or <span class="accented">the out-swollen cup.</span> It is the fulness of the measure of Jerusalem's punishment, not its character, which is pointed at. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:17-23 God calls upon his people to mind the things that belong to their everlasting peace. Jerusalem had provoked God, and was made to taste the bitter fruits. Those who should have been her comforters, were their own tormentors. They have no patience by which to keep possesion of their own souls, nor any confidence in God's promise, by which to keep possession of its comfort. Thou art drunken, not as formerly, with the intoxicating cup of Babylon's idolatries, but with the cup of affliction. Know, then, the cause of God's people may for a time seem as lost, but God will protect it, by convincing the conscience, or confounding the projects, of those that strive against it. The oppressors required souls to be subjected to them, that every man should believe and worship as they would have them. But all they could gain by violence was, that people were brought to outward hypocritical conformity, for consciences cannot be forced.</body></html>
