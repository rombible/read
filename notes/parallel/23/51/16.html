in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;">Isaiah 49:2</a>, is addressed to <span class= "ital">the </span>Servant of the Lord. Of these, some (Cheyne), struck by the apparent abruptness, assume it to be misplaced. There seems no adequate reason for adopting either hypothesis. The words are spoken to Israel, contemplated as in its ideal, as were the others to the actual Israel. It remains true, as ever, that that ideal is fulfilled only in <span class= "ital">the </span>Servant.<p><span class= "bld">That I may plant.</span>--Noteworthy as the first intimation of the new heaven and the new earth, implying a restitution of all things, of which we find the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-22.htm" title="For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, said the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.">Isaiah 66:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I have put my words in thy mouth</span>. Some commentators detach this verse altogether from the preceding passage, and regard it as a fragment intruded here out of its proper place by some unaccountable accident. From the close resemblance of the expressions used to those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, they consider that the person addressed must be "the Servant of Jehovah," and hence conclude that the verse "originally stood in some other context" (Cheyne). It is, however, quite possible to regard Israel as still addressed; since Israel too was the recipient of God's words (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>), and was protected by God's hand from destruction, and kept in existence until the happy time should come when God would create a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>) for Israel's dwelling-place<span class="cmt_word">, and say unto Zion</span> - <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the "new Jerusalem" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my people</span>. This crowning promise well terminates the comforting address wherewith Jehovah at this time saw fit to cheer and encourage his captive people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:9-16 The people whom Christ has redeemed with his blood, as well as by his power, will obtain joyful deliverance from every enemy. He that designs such joy for us at last, will he not work such deliverance in the mean time, as our cases require? In this world of changes, it is a short step from joy to sorrow, but in that world, sorrow shall never come in view. They prayed for the display of God's power; he answers them with consolations of his grace. Did we dread to sin against God, we should not fear the frowns of men. Happy is the man that fears God always. And Christ's church shall enjoy security by the power and providence of the Almighty.</body></html>
