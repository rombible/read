(1) The redeemed and ideal Israel, or (2) the Servant of the Lord, or (3) the prophet, or (4) Jehovah, as in self-communing, after the manner of men, like that of Deborah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm" title="Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.">Judges 5:12</a>. On the whole the first seems the preferable view; but the loftiness of poetry, perhaps, transcends all such distinctions. The appeal is, in any case, to the great deeds of God in the past, as the pledge and earnest of yet greater in the future. "Rahab," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm" title="For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.">Isaiah 30:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm" title="You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; you have scattered your enemies with your strong arm.">Psalm 89:10</a>, is Egypt; and the "dragon," like "leviathan" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13</a>, stands for Pharaoh. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>.) Cheyne quotes from Bunsen's "Egypt," vol. vi., an invocation to the god Ra, from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, "Hail, thou who hast cut in pieces the scorner and strangled the Apophis (<span class= "ital">sc. </span>the evil serpent)," as a striking parallel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - AN APPEAL OF THE PROPHET TO GOD TO AROUSE HIMSELF, WITH A PROMISE OF ISRAEL'S RESTORATION. There has been much doubt as to the utterer of this "splendid apostrophe." Zion, the prophet, the angels, Jehovah, and God the Son pleading with God the Father, have been suggested. To us it seems simplest and best to assign the passage to the prophet. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, awake</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a>). When God neglects the prayers and supplications of his people, he is spoken of as "asleep," and needing to be awoke by a loud cry. The anthropomorphism is obvious, and <span class="accented">of course</span> not to be taken literally (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Put on strength</span>. Gird the strength to thee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>) which thou hadst laid aside while thou wept asleep<span class="cmt_word">. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab?</span> rather, <span class="accented">was it not thou that didst cleave Rahab in pieces?</span> Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a> and Psalm 89:10, "Rahab" would seem to be a symbolical expression for Egypt. "<span class="accented">Rahab"</span> is literally "<span class="accented">pride</span>," or "the proud one." The event alluded to, both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, is the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea (see ver. 10<span class="cmt_word">). And wounded the dragon</span>. "The dragon" is another symbol of the Egyptian power (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, "Pharaoh, King of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers"). Originally designating God's great enemy, Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>), it is a term which comes to be applied to the adversaries of the Almighty generally. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:9-16 The people whom Christ has redeemed with his blood, as well as by his power, will obtain joyful deliverance from every enemy. He that designs such joy for us at last, will he not work such deliverance in the mean time, as our cases require? In this world of changes, it is a short step from joy to sorrow, but in that world, sorrow shall never come in view. They prayed for the display of God's power; he answers them with consolations of his grace. Did we dread to sin against God, we should not fear the frowns of men. Happy is the man that fears God always. And Christ's church shall enjoy security by the power and providence of the Almighty.</body></html>
