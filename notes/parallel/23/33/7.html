Having "sketched the main outlines of his revelation," Isaiah proceeds to "fill in and apply the details" (Cheyne). He first describes the despair and low condition of Judah: the men of war wailing aloud; the ambassadors just returned kern Laehish weeping at the ill success of their embassy; all travelling stopped; the land wasted and made a desert; the Assyrians still ravaging and destroying, despite the peace which had been made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>). Then suddenly he sees Jehovah rousing himself (ver. 10), and the Assyrians con-stoned, as if with a fire (vers. 11, 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without</span>. "Their lion-hearts "(Cheyne); "heroes" (Delitzsch). Literally, <span class="accented">lions of God</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>). They raise a cry of mourning in the streets, with child-like effusiveness (comp. Herod., 8:99; 9:24). <span class="cmt_word">The ambassadors of peace</span>. Hezekiah probably sent several embassies to Sennacherib in the course of the war. One went to Lachish, offering submission, in <span class="date">B.C. 701</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>); another to Nineveh, with tribute and presents, in the same or the following year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>; comp. 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135). A third probably sought to deprecate Sennacherib's auger, when he made his second invasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>) in <span class="date">B.C. 699</span> (?). These last would seem to be the "ambassadors" of this verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-14 Here we have the proud and false destroyer justly reckoned with for all his fraud and violence. The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.</body></html>
