What those rivers were to Nineveh and Babylon, that the presence of Jehovah would be to Jerusalem, that could boast only of the softly going waters of Shiloah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm" title="For as much as this people refuses the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;">Isaiah 8:6</a>). Here, again, we have an echo of Psalms 46 : "There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God." The words help us to understand the symbolism of Ezekiel's vision of the "river that could not be passed over," flowing out of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.">Ezekiel 47:1-5</a>). And the spiritual river of the Divine Presence would have this advantage over those of which the great cities boasted, that no hostile fleet, no pirate ships, could use it for their attacks. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm" title="You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.">Psalm 48:7</a> the "ships of Tarshish" are probably to be taken 'figuratively rather than literally' for the Assyrian forces.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a Place of broad rivers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">there in majesty the Lord is ours</span>; [<span class="accented">the Lord who is</span>] <span class="accented">a Place of broad rivers</span>, etc. Some critics think that "a place of broad rivers" may be exegetical of <span class="accented">sham</span>, "there," and so apply it to Jerusalem; but the majority regard the phrase as applied directly to Jehovah. As he is "a <span class="accented">Place</span> to hide in" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-114.htm">Psalm 119:114</a>), so he may be "a <span class="accented">Place</span> of broad rivers," full, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of refreshment and spiritual blessing. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein shall go no galley</span>. The river of God's grace, which "makes glad the city of God, "shall bear no enemy on its surface, allow no invader to cross it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:15-24 The true believer watches against all occasions of sin. The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.</body></html>
