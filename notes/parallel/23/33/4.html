He who came to spoil should find himself spoiled. As caterpillars and locusts devour the green herbage, so should he (or they, the indefinite pronoun standing for the people of Jerusalem) strip his camp of all its treasures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your spoil shall be gathered</span>. The "spoiling" of Assyria would commence with the discomfiture of the great host. In the historical narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>) nothing is said of it; but, beyond a doubt, when the host was to a largo extent destroyed, and the remainder fled, there must have been an enormous booty left behind, which the enemies of the Assyrians would naturally seize. A further spoiling of the fugitives probably followed; and, the <span class="accented">prestige</span> of the great king being gone, marauding bands would probably on all sides ravage the Assyrian territory. <span class="cmt_word">Like the gathering of the caterpillar</span>. The "caterpillar" (<span class="accented">khasil</span>) is probably the grub out of which the locust develops - a very destructive insect. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he run</span>. It would be better to render, <span class="accented">shall they</span> run. The word, indeed, is in the singular; but it is used distributively, of the various spoilers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-14 Here we have the proud and false destroyer justly reckoned with for all his fraud and violence. The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.</body></html>
