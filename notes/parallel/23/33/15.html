The man who is true and just in all his dealings can dwell in closest fellowship with that holiness which is to others as a consuming fire. To him it is a protection and defence, a "rock fortress," in which he can dwell securely, where he will find all that he needs for the sustenance of soul and body, the bread and the water of life. The picture of the righteous man is in part an echo, probably a conscious echo, of Psalms 15, 24<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that walketh righteously</span>, etc. The prophet answers the question which he has supposed to be asked. None can endure the revelation of the presence of God but the holy and the upright - "he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>; comp. 15:2-5). Uprightness is then explained as consisting in six things mainly - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Just conduct; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> righteous speech; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> hatred of oppression; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> rejection of bribes; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> closing the ear against murderous suggestions; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> closing the eye against sinful sights. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may compare with this summa, y those of the Psalms above quoted. No enumeration is complete, or intended to be complete. Isaiah's has special reference to the favorite <span class="accented">sins</span> of the time - injustice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>), oppression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>; etc.), the receiving of bribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), and bloodshed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:15-24 The true believer watches against all occasions of sin. The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.</body></html>
