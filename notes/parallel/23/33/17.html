So the Targum gives "Thine eyes shall see the Shekinah of the King of Ages." Their primary meaning is, however, obviously historical. The "king" is Hezekiah, who shall be seen no longer in sackcloth and ashes, and with downcast eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.">Isaiah 37:1</a>), but in all the "beauty" of triumph and of majesty, of a youth and health renewed like the eagle; and the "land that is very far off" is the whole land of Israel, all prosperous and peaceful, as contrasted with the narrow range of view which the people had had during the siege, pent up within the walls of Jerusalem. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/13-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now your eyes, and look from the place where you are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:">Genesis 13:14-15</a>.) Comp. as to form, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-18.htm" title="And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.">Isaiah 29:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm" title="And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not your teachers be removed into a corner any more, but your eyes shall see your teachers:">Isaiah 30:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine eyes</span>. Another transition. Here from the third person to the second, the prophet now addressing those righteous ones of whom he has been speaking in the two preceding verses. <span class="cmt_word">Shall see</span> <span class="cmt_word">the King in his beauty</span>. The Messianic King, whoever he might be, and whenever he might make his appearance. It has been said that beauty is not predicated of the heavenly King (Cheyne); but <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-17.htm">Zechariah 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a>; and Canticles, <span class="accented">passim</span>, contradict this assertion. "How great is his beauty;" "Thou art fairer than the children of men;" "His mouth is most sweet; yea, he is altogether lovely." <span class="cmt_word">The land that is very far off</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the land of far distances</span>. Bishop Lowth renders, "Thine own land far extended," and so Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne. But if "the King" is Messianic, so doubtless is "<span class="accented">the</span> land" - the world-wide tract over which Messiah will reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:15-24 The true believer watches against all occasions of sin. The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.</body></html>
