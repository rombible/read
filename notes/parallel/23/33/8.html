The meaning is that' they were unoccupied. Fear of the Assyrians restrained men from travelling. <span class="cmt_word">He hath broken the covenant</span>. Sennacherib, when he accepted the sum of money sent him by Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>; 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135), must have consented to leave him unmolested for the future. But in a very short time we find him, apparently without any reasonable pretext, sending a fresh expedition against Jerusalem, requiring it to be admitted within the walls, and even threatening the city with destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10-13</a>).

The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.</body></html>
