There is, perhaps, a reference to Sennacherib's threat to remove the entire population from Jerusalem to a far country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>). This threat should not take effect. <span class="cmt_word">Not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed.</span> By "the stakes" are meant "the tent-pegs," to which the ropes are fastened which keep the tent firm (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-10.htm">Exodus 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-18.htm">Exodus 38:18, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>). The promise that they shall "never" be removed must be understood either as conditional on the people's walking uprightly (ver. 15), or as a promise of a <span class="accented">long</span> continuance merely. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:15-24 The true believer watches against all occasions of sin. The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.</body></html>
