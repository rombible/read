The outward desolation, with its rank growth of underwood, was to the prophet's eye a type of the moral condition of his people. And for such a people sin becomes the punishment of sin, and burns like a fire in a forest thicket, leaving the land clear for fresh culture and a better growth. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/33-11.htm" title="You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.">Isaiah 33:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-5.htm" title="Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!">James 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm" title="But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is near to cursing; whose end is to be burned.">Hebrews 6:8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wickedness burneth as the fire</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the contagion of wickedness overspreads a whole nation in the same rapid way that fire spreads over a field of stubble or a forest. <span class="cmt_word">They shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they - i.e.</span>, the forest <span class="accented">thickets - shall be whirled upward with the uplifting of smoke</span>.

The flames of wickedness give no light to a land, but lunge it in heavy, hopeless gloom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:8-21 Those are ripening apace for ruin, whose hearts are unhumbled under humbling providences. For that which God designs, in smiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gained by lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the people misled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected with it. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's ways displease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them. God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulers were the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, the most despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relations who were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smites them, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he will overcome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.</body></html>
