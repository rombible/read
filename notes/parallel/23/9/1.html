That version is, however, so obscure as to be almost unintelligible, and requires an entire remodelling:--<span class= "ital">Surely there is no gloom to her that was afflicted. In the former time he brought shame on the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter he bringeth honour on the way by the sea, beyond Jordan, the circuit of the Gentiles.</span><p>The prophet had seen in the closing verses of Isaiah 8 the extreme point of misery. That picture, as it were, dissolves, and another takes its place. She that was afflicted, the whole land of Israel, should have no more affliction. The future should be in striking contrast with the past. The lands of Zebulun and Naphtali, the region afterwards known as the Upper and Lower Galilee, had been laid waste and spoiled by Tiglath-pilneser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>). That same region, described by the prophet in different terms (the former representing the tribal divisions, the latter the geographical) is hereafter to be the scene of a glory greater than Israel had ever known before.<p><span class= "bld">The way of the sea . . .</span>--The context shows that the "sea" is that which appears in Bible history under the names of the sea of Chinnereth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm" title="And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm" title="The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>), the Sea of Galilee, the Sea of Tiberias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>), Gennesaret (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-53.htm" title="And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.">Mark 6:53</a>). The high road thence to Damascus was known as <span class= "ital">Via Maris </span>in the time of the Crusaders (Renan, quoted by Cheyne).<p><span class= "bld">Beyond Jordan.</span>--This, the Peraea of later geography, included the regions of Gilead and Bashan, the old kingdoms of Moab and Ammon, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.

Why the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.">Joshua 5:9</a>), means strictly "a circle," or "circuit." It was applied to the border-lands of the Ph?nician frontier of the northern kingdom, inhabited by a mixed population, and therefore known as "Galilee of the Gentiles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/4-15.htm" title="The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;">Matthew 4:15-16</a>) what in mediaeval German would have been called the <span class= "ital">Heidenmark.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7</span> - THE TROUBLES OF ISRAEL SHALL END THROUGH THE BIRTH OF A MARVELOUS CHILD. The section of the prophecy commencing with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a> terminates in this glorious burst of glad and gracious promise. The gist of the whole section is: "Israel shall not suffer from Pekah and Rezin; her oppressors shall be Assyria and Egypt, more especially the former; Assyria shall overwhelm her, crush her, lay her low; she shall remain awhile in gloom and darkness; but at length the darkness shall be dispelled; a 'great light' shall shine forth, first in the north, then over all the land; 'the rod of the oppressor' shall be broken; a Child shall be born, who shall bear marvelous names, and shall rule over the full kingdom of David in justice and righteousness forever." God has spoken, and God will perform this. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation</span>, <span class="cmt_word">when</span>, etc. Our translators have misconceived the construction, and consequently missed the sense. The first two clauses, which they run together, are entirely separate and distinct. Translate, <span class="accented">Nevertheless there shall be no</span> (<span class="accented">more</span>) <span class="accented">darkness to her who was in affliction</span>. <span class="accented">As at the former time he brought contempt upon the land of Zebulon</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. Contempt was brought on the more northern part of the Holy Land, first when it was overrun and ravaged by the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>) under Ben-hadad, and more recently when it bore the brunt of the Assyrian attack (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) under Tiglath-Pileser. <span class="cmt_word">At the first... and afterward</span>; rather, <span class="accented">at the former time</span>... <span class="accented">in the latter time</span>. The contrast is between two periods of Israel's history, the existing period and the Messianic. <span class="cmt_word">And afterward did more grievously afflict her</span>. This is altogether wrong. Translate, <span class="accented">So in the latter time he hath brought honor on the way of the sea</span>. The perfect is a "prophetic perfect," and the reference is to the honor that would be done to the northern districts, "the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali," by the Messiah dwelling there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-14.htm">Matthew 4:14-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The way of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district about the sea of Tiberias, called "the sea of Kinnereth" (equivalent to "Gennesareth") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, and "the sea of Galilee" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tract east of the sea and of the upper Jordan, where the five thousand were fed, and where our Lord was transfigured. <span class="cmt_word">Galilee of the nations</span>. The name "Galilee" seems to have been given to the outlying circuit, or zone, on the north, which was debatable ground between the Israelites and their neighbors (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>). The word means "circuit," or "ring." Though claimed as theirs by the Israelites, it was largely peopled by "Gentiles." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 The Syrians and Assyrians first ravaged the countries here mentioned, and that region was first favoured by the preaching of Christ. Those that want the gospel, walk in darkness, and in the utmost danger. But when the gospel comes to any place, to any soul, light comes. Let us earnestly pray that it may shine into our hearts, and make us wise unto salvation. The gospel brings joy with it. Those who would have joy, must expect to go through hard work, as the husbandman, before he has the joy of harvest; and hard conflict, as the soldier, before he divides the spoil. The Jews were delivered from the yoke of many oppressors; this was a shadow of the believer's deliverance from the yoke of Satan. The cleansing the souls of believers from the power and pollution of sin, would be by the influence of the Holy Spirit, as purifying fire. These great things for the church, shall be done by the Messiah, Emmanuel. The Child is born; it was certain; and the church, before Christ came in the flesh, benefitted by his undertaking. It is a prophecy of him and of his kingdom, which those that waited for the Consolation of Israel read with pleasure. This Child was born for the benefit of us men, of us sinners, of all believers, from the beginning to the end of the world. Justly is he called Wonderful, for he is both God and man. His love is the wonder of angels and glorified saints. He is the Counsellor, for he knew the counsels of God from eternity; and he gives counsel to men, in which he consults our welfare. He is the Wonderful Counsellor; none teaches like him. He is God, the mighty One. Such is the work of the Mediator, that no less power than that of the mighty God could bring it to pass. He is God, one with the Father. As the Prince of Peace, he reconciles us to God; he is the Giver of peace in the heart and conscience; and when his kingdom is fully established, men shall learn war no more. The government shall be upon him; he shall bear the burden of it. Glorious things are spoken of Christ's government. There is no end to the increase of its peace, for the happiness of its subjects shall last for ever. The exact agreement of this prophecy with the doctrine of the New Testament, shows that Jewish prophets and Christian teachers had the same view of the person and salvation of the Messiah. To what earthly king or kingdom can these words apply? Give then, O Lord, to thy people to know thee by every endearing name, and in every glorious character. Give increase of grace in every heart of thy redeemed upon earth.</body></html>
