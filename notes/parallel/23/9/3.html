<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-27.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.">Jeremiah 31:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-11.htm" title="And I will multiply on you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better to you than at your beginnings: and you shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 36:11</a>), and scarcely admits of the dark shadow introduced by the reading of the text, unless, with some critics (Kay), we see in the words a contrast between the outward prosperity of the days of Solomon and Uzziah, in which there was no permanent joy, and the abundancy of joyfulness under the ideal king.<p><span class= "bld">They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest . . .</span>--The words "before thee" are significant. The gladness of the people is that of worshippers at a sacrificial feast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-7.htm" title="And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm" title="But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>), who find the secret spring of blessing in their consciousness of the presence of Jehovah. So the New Testament writers speak of "rejoicing in the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.">Philippians 3:1</a>), of "joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>). This "joy of harvest" represents the peaceful side of that gladness, thought of as the gift of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>). But it had another aspect. It was the rejoicing after a conflict, historically with foes like the Assyrians, spiritually with all powers hostile to the true kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>). The joy of the conquerors on the battle-field, like that of harvest, had become proverbial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-162.htm" title="I rejoice at your word, as one that finds great spoil.">Psalm 119:162</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy</span>. Dr. Kay defends this reading, and supposes a contrast of time between this clause and the next; he renders, "Thou <span class="accented">didst</span> multiply the nation" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the days of Solomon and again in those of Uzziah) "and not increase the joy; <span class="accented">but now</span>," etc. The objection is that the verbs are all in the same tense, the simple preterit, and that there is nothing in the original corresponding to "but now." Almost all other recent commentators accept the solution offered by the Masoretic reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>), which makes the passage simple and easy: "Thou hast multiplied the nation; its joy thou hast increased; they joy before thee," etc. (So many Hebrew manuscripts, the Alexandrine Septuagint, the Syriac, Gesenius, Knobel, Cheyne, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">According to the joy in harvest.</span> "The joy in harvest" was to the Jews the joy of the Feast of Tabernacles, or in gathering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), held when the last fruits were brought in. But the prophet is perhaps taking a wider view, and thinking of the many harvest festivals prevailing throughout Western Asia, all of them originating in gratitude to the Giver of all good, and many of them comprising manifestations of joy more jubilant than those habitual to his sedater countrymen. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 The Syrians and Assyrians first ravaged the countries here mentioned, and that region was first favoured by the preaching of Christ. Those that want the gospel, walk in darkness, and in the utmost danger. But when the gospel comes to any place, to any soul, light comes. Let us earnestly pray that it may shine into our hearts, and make us wise unto salvation. The gospel brings joy with it. Those who would have joy, must expect to go through hard work, as the husbandman, before he has the joy of harvest; and hard conflict, as the soldier, before he divides the spoil. The Jews were delivered from the yoke of many oppressors; this was a shadow of the believer's deliverance from the yoke of Satan. The cleansing the souls of believers from the power and pollution of sin, would be by the influence of the Holy Spirit, as purifying fire. These great things for the church, shall be done by the Messiah, Emmanuel. The Child is born; it was certain; and the church, before Christ came in the flesh, benefitted by his undertaking. It is a prophecy of him and of his kingdom, which those that waited for the Consolation of Israel read with pleasure. This Child was born for the benefit of us men, of us sinners, of all believers, from the beginning to the end of the world. Justly is he called Wonderful, for he is both God and man. His love is the wonder of angels and glorified saints. He is the Counsellor, for he knew the counsels of God from eternity; and he gives counsel to men, in which he consults our welfare. He is the Wonderful Counsellor; none teaches like him. He is God, the mighty One. Such is the work of the Mediator, that no less power than that of the mighty God could bring it to pass. He is God, one with the Father. As the Prince of Peace, he reconciles us to God; he is the Giver of peace in the heart and conscience; and when his kingdom is fully established, men shall learn war no more. The government shall be upon him; he shall bear the burden of it. Glorious things are spoken of Christ's government. There is no end to the increase of its peace, for the happiness of its subjects shall last for ever. The exact agreement of this prophecy with the doctrine of the New Testament, shows that Jewish prophets and Christian teachers had the same view of the person and salvation of the Messiah. To what earthly king or kingdom can these words apply? Give then, O Lord, to thy people to know thee by every endearing name, and in every glorious character. Give increase of grace in every heart of thy redeemed upon earth.</body></html>
