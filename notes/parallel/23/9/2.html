The prophet sees in his vision a light shining on the forlorn and weary wanderers. They had been wandering in the "valley of the shadow of death" (the phrase comes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm" title="Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.">Psalm 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm" title="Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell on it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.">Job 3:5</a>), almost as in the gloom of Sheol itself. Now there breaks in the dawn of a glorious day. Historically the return of some of the inhabitants of that region to their allegiance to Jehovah and the house of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-11.htm" title="Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 30:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-13.htm" title="And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.">2Chronicles 30:13</a>) may have been the starting point of the prophet's hopes. The words have to the Christian student a special interest, as having been quoted by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/4-15.htm" title="The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;">Matthew 4:15-16</a>) in connection with our Lord's ministry in Galilee, perhaps with His being "of Nazareth," which was in the tribe of Zebulun. We cannot positively say that such a fulfilment as that was in the prophet's thoughts. The context shows in that he was thinking of Assyrian invasions, and the defeat of Assyrian armies, of a nation growing strong in numbers and prosperity. In this, as in other cases, the Evangelist adapts the words of prophecy to a further meaning than that which apparently was in the mind of the writer, and interprets them by his own experience. When he compared the state of Galilee, yet more, perhaps, that of his own soul, before and after the Son of man had appeared as the light of the world, Isaiah's words seemed the only adequate expression of the change.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people that walked in darkness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>). All the world was "in darkness" when Christ came; but here the Jews especially seem to be intended. It was truly a dark time with them when Christ came (see Dollinger's 'Judenthum and Heidenthum,' vol. 2. pp. 301-335). <span class="cmt_word">Have seen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">saw</span>.

For thirty years he had dwelt at Nazareth, in Zebulon. There he had first come forward to teach in a synagogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>); in Galilee he had done his first miracles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-54.htm">John 4:54</a>); at Capernaum. "Upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim," he commenced his preaching of repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-17</a>). The "light" first streamed forth in this quarter, glorifying the region on which contempt had long been poured. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 The Syrians and Assyrians first ravaged the countries here mentioned, and that region was first favoured by the preaching of Christ. Those that want the gospel, walk in darkness, and in the utmost danger. But when the gospel comes to any place, to any soul, light comes. Let us earnestly pray that it may shine into our hearts, and make us wise unto salvation. The gospel brings joy with it. Those who would have joy, must expect to go through hard work, as the husbandman, before he has the joy of harvest; and hard conflict, as the soldier, before he divides the spoil. The Jews were delivered from the yoke of many oppressors; this was a shadow of the believer's deliverance from the yoke of Satan. The cleansing the souls of believers from the power and pollution of sin, would be by the influence of the Holy Spirit, as purifying fire. These great things for the church, shall be done by the Messiah, Emmanuel. The Child is born; it was certain; and the church, before Christ came in the flesh, benefitted by his undertaking. It is a prophecy of him and of his kingdom, which those that waited for the Consolation of Israel read with pleasure. This Child was born for the benefit of us men, of us sinners, of all believers, from the beginning to the end of the world. Justly is he called Wonderful, for he is both God and man. His love is the wonder of angels and glorified saints. He is the Counsellor, for he knew the counsels of God from eternity; and he gives counsel to men, in which he consults our welfare. He is the Wonderful Counsellor; none teaches like him. He is God, the mighty One. Such is the work of the Mediator, that no less power than that of the mighty God could bring it to pass. He is God, one with the Father. As the Prince of Peace, he reconciles us to God; he is the Giver of peace in the heart and conscience; and when his kingdom is fully established, men shall learn war no more. The government shall be upon him; he shall bear the burden of it. Glorious things are spoken of Christ's government. There is no end to the increase of its peace, for the happiness of its subjects shall last for ever. The exact agreement of this prophecy with the doctrine of the New Testament, shows that Jewish prophets and Christian teachers had the same view of the person and salvation of the Messiah. To what earthly king or kingdom can these words apply? Give then, O Lord, to thy people to know thee by every endearing name, and in every glorious character. Give increase of grace in every heart of thy redeemed upon earth.</body></html>
