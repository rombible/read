The vision of the glory of the far-off king comes to an end, and the prophet returns to the more immediate surroundings of his time. The "word" which Jehovah sends is the prophetic message that follows. It is a question whether the terms "Jacob" and "Israel" stand in the parallelism of identity or contrast, but the use of the former term in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/2-5.htm" title="O house of Jacob, come you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.">Isaiah 2:5-6</a>, makes the former use more probable. In this case both names stand practically for the kingdom of Judah as the true representative of Israel, the apostate kingdom of the Ten Tribes being no longer worthy of the name, and therefore described here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-5.htm" title="Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against you, saying,">Isaiah 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-8.htm" title="For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-17.htm" title="The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:17</a>, simply as Ephraim. The occasion of the prophecy is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-9.htm" title="And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,">Isaiah 9:9</a>. Pekah, the king of Ephraim, was still confident in his strength, and in spite of his partial failure, and the defeat of his ally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>), derided the prophet's prediction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-21.</span> - THE PROPHET RETURNS TO THREATS AND WARNINGS, ADDRESSED CHIEFLY TO THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL. The remainder of this chapter, together with the first four verses of the next, seems to have formed originally a distinct and separate prophecy. The passage is a poem in four stanzas, with the same refrain at the end of each: "For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still." A somewhat early date has been assigned to the prophecy, as; for instance, "some period in the reign of Jotham" (Cheyne); but the internal evidence only proves that it was written before the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob... Israel.</span> These words do not show that the prophecy is directed against the kingdom of Israel only. "Jacob" designates Judah rather than Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3, 5, 6</a>; and the expression, "both the houses of Israel," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>, shows that the term "Israel" embraces both kingdoms. Tim distinctive names by which Isaiah ordinarily designates the northern kingdom are "Ephraim" and "Samaria." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:8-21 Those are ripening apace for ruin, whose hearts are unhumbled under humbling providences. For that which God designs, in smiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gained by lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the people misled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected with it. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's ways displease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them. God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulers were the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, the most despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relations who were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smites them, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he will overcome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.</body></html>
