and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.">Isaiah 31:8</a> for "mighty man," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-9.htm" title="And the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself: therefore forgive them not.">Isaiah 2:9</a> for "great man," and probably retains that meaning here. The nobles of Judah, who had been tyrannous and oppressive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm" title="Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.">Isaiah 1:23</a>), should become a true aristocracy, beneficent and protecting. Of both the "king" and the "man" it is true that they find their fulfilment in the true servant of the Lord, who is also the ideal king.<p><span class= "bld">As rivers of water . . .</span>--The words paint the picture of the two great blessings of an Eastern landscape: the streams that turn the desert into an oasis, the "rock" throwing its dark shadow as a shelter from the noontide heat. The word for "rock" is the same as that used for Assyria in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-9.htm" title="And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, said the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.">Isaiah 31:9</a>, and is obviously chosen to emphasise the contrast.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind</span>, etc. Modern critics mostly render, "each man" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the king, and each of his princes. But it is, to say the least, <span class="accented">allowable</span> - with Vitringa and Kay - to regard the word as referring <span class="accented">to</span> the king only (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>, where <span class="accented">ish</span>, a man, is used in the same vague way of One who is clearly the Messiah). There was never but <span class="accented">one</span> man who could be to other men all that is predicated in this verse of the "man" mentioned (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>, where nearly the same epithets are predicated of God). <span class="cmt_word">A covert</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span> a protection against Divine wrath.

The shadow of a great rook. At once refreshing and protecting (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-8 Christ our righteous King, and his true disciples, are evidently here intended. The consolations and graces of his Spirit are as rivers of water in this dry land; and as the overhanging rock affords refreshing shade and shelter to the weary traveller in the desert, so his power, truth, and love, yield the believer the only real protection and refreshment in the weary land through which he journeys to heaven. Christ bore the storm himself, to keep it off from us. To him let the trembling sinner flee for refuge; for he alone can protect and refresh us in every trial. See what pains sinners take in sin; they labour at it, their hearts are intent upon it, and with art they work iniquity; but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischief than God permits. Let us seek to have our hearts more freed from selfishness. The liberal soul devises liberal things concerning God, and desires that He will grant wisdom and prudence, the comforts of his presence, the influence of his Spirit, and in due time the enjoyment of his glory.</body></html>
