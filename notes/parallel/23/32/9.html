It probably finds a place here as painting the <span class= "ital">harem </span>influence, which then, as in the policy of modern Eastern monarchies, Constantinople and elsewhere, lay behind the counsels of the king and his ministers. The whole tone is that of invective against the women of the pseudo-aristocracy that had been covertly attacked in the preceding verses.<p><span class= "bld">Give ear unto my speech . . .</span>--Another echo of the teaching of the Proverbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm" title="My son, if you will receive my words, and hide my commandments with you;">Proverbs 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-1.htm" title="My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:">Proverbs 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm" title="Hear, you children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.">Proverbs 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-20.htm" title="My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:">Proverbs 6:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - A REBUKE OF THE WOMEN. It might seem at first sight as if we had here a detached utterance of the prophet, accidentally conjoined with the preceding passage (vers. 1-8). But vers. 15-18 furnish a link of connection between the two portions of the chapter, and make it probable that they were delivered at the same time. Mr. Cheyne supposes that the indifference of a knot of women, gathered at some little distance from the men to whom Isaiah had addressed vers. 1-8, provoked the prophet suddenly to turn to them, and speak to them in terms of warning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rise up</span>. The "careless daughters" are sitting, or reclining upon couches, at their ease. The prophet bids them stand up, to hear a message from God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye women that are at ease</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that are self-satisfied and self-complacent." The word employed has almost always a bad sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hear my voice</span>. This clause should be attached to the first half of the verse. The order of the words in the original is, "Ye women that are at ease, rise up and hear my words; ye careless daughters, hearken unto my speech." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:9-20 When there was so much provocation given to the holy God, bad times might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful stinginess! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in all places, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patient labourers shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.</body></html>
