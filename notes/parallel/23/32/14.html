The forts are those of Ophel (so in Heb.), the fortified south-eastern slope of the Temple mountain; the towers, probably such as "the tower of the flock," mentioned in conjunction with Ophel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-8.htm" title="And you, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.">Micah 4:8</a>. These would serve as dens for the wild asses, which commonly roved in the open country.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The palaces shall be forsaken</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the palace</span>; but the word is used in a generic sense. The prophet sees in vision Jerusalem deserted by her inhabitants, the grand houses of the rich empty, the strongholds haunted by wild beasts, and the slopes of the hills fed on by sheep, and even occasionally visited by the timid and solitude-loving wild ass. The description suits well the time of the Babylonian captivity, but not any earlier period. Probably it was not revealed to the prophet how soon the condition would be reached. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of the city shall be left</span>. The real meaning is, as Bishop Lowth expresses it, "The populous city shall be left desolate." But the whole passage is. as Delitzsch observes, "grammatically strange, the language becoming more complicated, disjointed, and difficult, the greater the wrath and indignation of the poet." <span class="cmt_word">The forts and towers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hill and tower</span>, with (perhaps) a special reference to the part of Jerusalem called Ophel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>, etc.), the long projecting spur from the eastern hill, which points a little west of south, and separates the Kedron valley from the Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be for dens</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for caves</span>; but dens for wild beasts seem to be meant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For ever</span>. This expression must not be pressed. Hyperbole is a recognized feature of poetry written under strong excitement. <span class="cmt_word">A joy of wild asses</span>. The wild ass is not now found nearer Palestine than Mesopotamia, or perhaps Northern Syria. It is exceedingly shy, and never approaches the habitations of men. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:9-20 When there was so much provocation given to the holy God, bad times might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful stinginess! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in all places, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patient labourers shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.</body></html>
