The addition of <span class= "ital">"</span>princes" worthy of their king emphasises this reference. The words are as an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/8-15.htm" title="By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.">Proverbs 8:15-16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - A PROPHECY OF MESSIAH'S KINGDOM. It is generally allowed that this prophecy is Messianic; but some critics insist that it is not so "in a narrow sense." They regard Isaiah as expecting Messiah's kingdom to follow immediately on the discomfiture of Sennacherib, and as looking to Hezekiah to inaugurate it. According to this view, Hezekiah, renovated in character, was to be the Messiah, and might have been so had he been "equal to the demands providentially made upon him." But he was not; and the task of establishing the kingdom fell to "another," at a later date. It is simpler to regard the prophet as looking for a greater than Hezekiah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), but ignorant how soon, or how late, his coming would be. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A king... princes</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "the king... the princes;" but the Hebrew gives no article. The announcement is vague, and corresponds to those of other prophets, as of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>), "Behold, the days come that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king shall reign and prosper;" and of Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>), "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion... behold, thy <span class="accented">King</span> cometh unto thee." The "princes" of the text are the minor authorities whom the king would set over his kingdom - i.e., the apostles and their successors. <span class="cmt_word">In righteousness... in judgment</span>. Messiah's rule will be a rule of strict justice and right, offering the strongest contrast to that under which the Jews have been living since the time of Jehoshaphat (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-12</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-8 Christ our righteous King, and his true disciples, are evidently here intended. The consolations and graces of his Spirit are as rivers of water in this dry land; and as the overhanging rock affords refreshing shade and shelter to the weary traveller in the desert, so his power, truth, and love, yield the believer the only real protection and refreshment in the weary land through which he journeys to heaven. Christ bore the storm himself, to keep it off from us. To him let the trembling sinner flee for refuge; for he alone can protect and refresh us in every trial. See what pains sinners take in sin; they labour at it, their hearts are intent upon it, and with art they work iniquity; but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischief than God permits. Let us seek to have our hearts more freed from selfishness. The liberal soul devises liberal things concerning God, and desires that He will grant wisdom and prudence, the comforts of his presence, the influence of his Spirit, and in due time the enjoyment of his glory.</body></html>
