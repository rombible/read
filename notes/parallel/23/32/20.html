The whole land should be irrigated by calmly flowing streams, and men should cast their seed broadcast, and the oxen and the asses should draw the plough over a rich and fertile land. The whole land should be under tillage, instead of being left to supply (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/7-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;">Isaiah 7:21-22</a>) a poor and meagre pasturage, or to bring forth nothing but the "thorns and briars" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm" title="On the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city:">Isaiah 32:13</a>. It is obvious that here also a spiritual meaning underlies the literal.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters</span>. The idyllic picture, begun in ver. 15, terminates here. The people of the kingdom have a well-watered land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>), where they live peacefully, sowing their seed beside the water-courses, and having abundant pasture for their peaceful beasts - the ox and the ass (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>). A spiritual meaning doubtless underlies the literal sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:9-20 When there was so much provocation given to the holy God, bad times might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful stinginess! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in all places, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patient labourers shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.</body></html>
