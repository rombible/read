Peace - a true peace, not a false one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>) - shall be the result of the reign of righteousness. War, quarrels, enmity, hostile feelings, are all of them the fruit of unrighteousness.

The final happiness of the blessed in Christ's kingdom is always spoken of as a state of "rest and quietness" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>, etc.). The "confidence" felt would be an assured confidence, not a rash and foolish one, like that of the women of vers. 10, 11. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:9-20 When there was so much provocation given to the holy God, bad times might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful stinginess! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in all places, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patient labourers shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.</body></html>
