Isaiah dwelt, as Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>) had dwelt before him, on the outpouring of the Spirit which should sweep away the frivolities of a profligate luxury and lead to a nobler life. The effect of that outpouring is described in symbolic language which had been used before (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-17.htm" title="Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?">Isaiah 29:17</a>), the "wilderness" taking the place of Lebanon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until</span>. The expression "until" modifies the previous "forever," showing that the desolation was <span class="accented">not</span> always to continue. <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit be poured upon us from on high.</span> An effluence from the Holy Spirit of God on individuals of eminence, prophets, kings, artificers, to fit them for their tasks, is recognized in many of the earlier books of Scripture, and especially in the Davidical psalms. But a general effluence of the Spirit of holiness on a nation, to produce a change of heart, seems to be first announced by Isaiah. The nearly contemporary prophecy of Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28, 29</a>) is, perhaps, as wide in its scope, but limited to the prophetic gift, which is not necessarily conjoined with spiritual-minded-ness or holiness of life. Isaiah, the "evangelical prophet," first teaches that the conversion of a nation is God's work, effected by the Holy Spirit, and effectual to the entire change of the heart of a people. <span class="cmt_word">And the wilderness be a fruitful</span> <span class="cmt_word">field</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the community long cursed with barrenness of good works" (ver. 10) "becomes once more fruitful of them." <span class="cmt_word">And the fruitful field be counted for a forest</span>. An order of climax seems to be here intended. The <span class="accented">midbar</span>, the bare pasturage-ground, becomes a Carmel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> carefully cultivated; the Carmel becomes like Lebanon, a rich and luxurious forest. There is no close parallel between this verse and ver. 17 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a>. The prophet is not tied down by his previous metaphors. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:9-20 When there was so much provocation given to the holy God, bad times might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful stinginess! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in all places, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patient labourers shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.</body></html>
