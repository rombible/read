Though you clothe yourself with crimson, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you rend your face with painting, in vain shall you make yourself fair; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.">Jeremiah 4:30</a>.) Here, apparently, it is used in the same way as the setting of the sapphires and other gems. For "windows" read <span class= "ital">pinnacles.</span><p><span class= "bld">Sapphires . . .</span>--As with the choice of the twelve gems for the High Priest's breast-plate, it is probable that each stone, over and above its visible beauty, had a symbolical significance. Sapphire, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>represented the azure of the firmament, as the "sapphire throne" of the Eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1</a>), and the <span class= "ital">rubies </span>(not "agates") and carbuncles may, in like manner, have answered to the fiery glow of the Divine love and the Divine wrath.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/54.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-17.</span> - THE GLORY OF THE NEW JERUSALEM, AND THE HAPPINESS OF ITS INHABITANTS. Hitherto Israel has been addressed; now the direct object of address is Jerusalem. The eye of the prophet passes, however, with a glance, from the actual present to the far-distant future, and sees the Zion of God in her heavenly setting, all bedecked with precious stones, as she was seen by the exile of Patmos more than seven centuries later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16-21</a>). After briefly describing the heavenly city, he passes to her inhabitants, and promises them peace, protection, and righteousness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O thou afflicted</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14-17</a>). Jerusalem is seen as she was during the Captivity - "afflicted" by God's hand, vexed with all his storms, and not yet comforted (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a>). Then a fresh vision obliterates the mournful sight. <span class="cmt_word">I will lay thy stones with fair colours</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I will lay thy stones in antimony</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will give them a setting and adornment like that which beautiful women were in the habit of giving to their eyes when they wished to attract admiration (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>). <span class="accented">Puk</span>, or antimony, was used to stain both the upper and the under eyelid, in order to increase the apparent lustre of the eye, and so impart to it greater beauty. The passage is not to be understood as implying that coloured marbles were ever really set in antimony. <span class="cmt_word">And lay thy foundations with sapphires</span>; or, <span class="accented">make thy foundations of sapphires.</span> In Revelation the <span class="accented">first</span> foundation is "jasper," the <span class="accented">second</span> "sapphire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>). Sapphire was the foundation on which the throne of God appeared to be set, when it was seen by Moses, Aaron, and the seventy elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>). The throne itself had the appearance of sapphire, as seen by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>). Sapphire is the hue of heaven. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/54.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>54:11-17 Let the people of God, when afflicted and tossed, think they hear God speaking comfortably to them by these words, taking notice of their griefs and fears. The church is all glorious when full of the knowledge of God; for none teaches like him. It is a promise of the teaching and gifts of the Holy Spirit. All that are taught of God are taught to love one another. This seems to relate especially to the glorious times to succeed the tribulations of the church. Holiness, more than any thing, is the beauty of the church. God promises protection. There shall be no fears within; there shall be no fightings without. Military men value themselves on their splendid titles, but God calls them, Wasters made to destroy, for they make wasting and destruction their business. He created them, therefore he will serve his own designs by them. The day is coming when God will reckon with wicked men for their hard speeches, Jude 1:15. Security and final victory are the heritage of each faithful servant of the Lord. The righteousness by which they are justified, and the grace by which they are sanctified, are the gift of God, and the effect of his special love. Let us beseech him to sanctify our souls, and to employ us in his service.</body></html>
