Christians are all of them "taught of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a> 1 Thessalonians 4:9). The "anointing," which they have from the Holy Ghost, "teaches them, and is truth, and is no lie" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a>), and causes them to "know all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And great shall be the peace of thy children</span>. Messiah was to be "the Prince of Peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). His birth heralded the coming of "peace on earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). So far forth as men are true Christians, does peace reign in the conscience and show itself in the life. Externally there may be persecution, tumult, wars, fightings; but internally, in each heart, there will be a "peace that passes all understanding" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>). God "keeps in perfect peace" those" whose minds are stayed on him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/54.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>54:11-17 Let the people of God, when afflicted and tossed, think they hear God speaking comfortably to them by these words, taking notice of their griefs and fears. The church is all glorious when full of the knowledge of God; for none teaches like him. It is a promise of the teaching and gifts of the Holy Spirit. All that are taught of God are taught to love one another. This seems to relate especially to the glorious times to succeed the tribulations of the church. Holiness, more than any thing, is the beauty of the church. God promises protection. There shall be no fears within; there shall be no fightings without. Military men value themselves on their splendid titles, but God calls them, Wasters made to destroy, for they make wasting and destruction their business. He created them, therefore he will serve his own designs by them. The day is coming when God will reckon with wicked men for their hard speeches, Jude 1:15. Security and final victory are the heritage of each faithful servant of the Lord. The righteousness by which they are justified, and the grace by which they are sanctified, are the gift of God, and the effect of his special love. Let us beseech him to sanctify our souls, and to employ us in his service.</body></html>
