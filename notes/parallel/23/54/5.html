"I," says the prophet, "have called thee married and widowed, thereby yoking thee to a husband, <span class="accented">for</span> thou hast a Husband, namely, thy Maker." (The Hebrew has both words in the plural, to accord with the following <span class="accented">Elohim.</span>) This relationship of God to his Church is often asserted by the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-4.htm">Song of Solomon 1:4</a>, etc.), and lies at the root of the oft-recurring metaphor by which idolatry is called "lewdness," "adultery," or "playing the whore<span class="cmt_word">." Thy Redeemer the Holy One</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thy Redeemer is the Holy One.</span> (On the title itself, see the comment on Isaiah 1:4.) <span class="cmt_word">The God of the whole earth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>:18, etc.). Materially, he was always this. Now, from this time, he will be "God of the whole earth" morally; not God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/54.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>54:1-5 Observe the low state of religion in the world, for a long time before Christianity was brought in. But by preaching the gospel, multitudes were converted from idols to the living God. This is matter of great rejoicing to the church. The bounds of the church were extended. Though its state on earth is but mean and movable, like a tent or tabernacle, it is sometimes a growing state, and must be enlarged as the family increases. But the more numerous the church grows, the more she must fortify herself against errors and corruptions. Thy Maker is thy Husband. Christ is the Holy One of Israel, the Mediator of the covenant made with the Old Testament church. Long he had been called the God of Israel; but now he shall be called the God of the whole earth. And he will cleanse from sin, and cause every true believer to rejoice in this sacred union. We never can enough admire this mercy, or duly value this privilege.</body></html>
