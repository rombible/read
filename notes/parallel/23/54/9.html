(2) as one of the few references to the Deluge, outside that book, in the Old Testament. Strictly speaking, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-11.htm" title="And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.">Genesis 9:11</a> speaks of a "covenant," not an "oath," but it would be idle to find a difficulty in the use of words which, as referring to a Divine act, are almost or altogether interchangeable. It is obvious that the words have found their fulfilment not in any earthly city but in the heavenly Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/54.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is as the waters of Noah unto me</span>. The existing calamity - Israel submerged in the flood of Babylonian captivity-is as it were a repetition of the calamity of the Deluge in God's eyes. Its object is to purify his Church, as the object of the Flood was to purify the world. A righteous household survived in the one case; a righteous remnant would go forth in the other. And as God bound himself in Noah's time not to repeat the calamity of the Deluge, so now he binds himself not again to submerge his Church in a captivity like the Babylonian. It has been said that the promise was not kept, since the Jewish Church was, in A.D. , carried captive by the Romans. But the prophet views the Jewish Church as continued in the Christian, into which all its better and more spiritual members passed at the first preaching of the gospel; and the promise here made is thus parallel to that of our Lord, "Upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). Much as the Christian Church has suffered from the world, it has never been in like cases with the Jewish Church in Babylon, and, as God is faithful, never will be reduced to such extremity. <span class="cmt_word">As I have sworn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pledged myself." It does not appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20-22</a> or Genesis 9:8-17 that God actually bound himself by oath. <span class="cmt_word">So have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee</span>. That is to say, not to the same extent, not so as to visit her with the same punishment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/54.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>54:6-10 As God is slow to anger, so he is swift to show mercy. And how sweet the returns of mercy would be, when God should come and comfort them! He will have mercy on them. God's gathering his people takes rise from his mercy, not any merit of theirs; and it is with great mercies, with everlasting kindness. The wrath is little, the mercies great; the wrath for a moment, the kindness everlasting. We are neither to despond under afflictions, nor to despair of relief. Mountains have been shaken and removed, but the promises of God never were broken by any event. Mountains and hills also signify great men. Creature-confidences shall fail; but when our friends fail us, our God does not. All this is alike applicable to the church at large, and to each believer. God will rebuke and correct his people for sins; but he will not cast them off. Let this encourage us to give the more diligence to make our calling and election sure.</body></html>
