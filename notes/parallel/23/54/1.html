put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1-12</a>, leaving the section <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>, as a mysterious episode. inserted, it may be, by the prophet to show how it was that the restoration of Israel and the victory of righteousness had become possible. We note, as bearing on Isaiah's studies, the parallelism with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm" title="They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.">1Samuel 2:5</a>. The "children of the desolate" are primarily the returning exiles, ultimately all the citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/54.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - A PROMISE TO ISRAEL OF GREAT INCREASE, AND OF GOD'S PERSISTENT PROTECTION. There is no close connection between this chapter and the last, or even between this section and the preceding. Vers. 1-5 take up the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19-21</a>, and expand it. Israel is assured of a great enlargement of her numbers, and bidden to rejoice thereat. She is then further comforted with a promise that she shall never be forsaken (vers. 6-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing, O barren</span>. Israel in captivity is addressed as "barren," because, in the time of suffering, her numbers rather diminished than increased. Still, she is bidden to "sing" on account of the prospect that is opening upon her. She that is now desolate and solitary will soon have more children than she formerly had, when she was a married wife, enjoying the fellowship of Jehovah, her Husband (ver. 5). The "children" spoken of are in part those who gathered themselves together in Jerusalem and the adjacent territory after the issue of the decree of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1-65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6-72</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3-36</a>), but mainly such as flocked in from the Gentiles, both before and after Christ's coming (see ver. 3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/54.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>54:1-5 Observe the low state of religion in the world, for a long time before Christianity was brought in. But by preaching the gospel, multitudes were converted from idols to the living God. This is matter of great rejoicing to the church. The bounds of the church were extended. Though its state on earth is but mean and movable, like a tent or tabernacle, it is sometimes a growing state, and must be enlarged as the family increases. But the more numerous the church grows, the more she must fortify herself against errors and corruptions. Thy Maker is thy Husband. Christ is the Holy One of Israel, the Mediator of the covenant made with the Old Testament church. Long he had been called the God of Israel; but now he shall be called the God of the whole earth. And he will cleanse from sin, and cause every true believer to rejoice in this sacred union. We never can enough admire this mercy, or duly value this privilege.</body></html>
