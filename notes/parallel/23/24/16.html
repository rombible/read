Two facts militate, however, against this view. The word translated "glory" is not that commonly used in doxologies, but rather "honour" or "praise," such as is applied to men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-9.htm" title="The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.">Isaiah 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm" title="Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!">Isaiah 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/28-4.htm" title="And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looks on it sees, while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.">Isaiah 28:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm" title="The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!">2Samuel 1:19</a>). (2) The term "the Righteous One "is never used absolutely as a name of 'God. On these grounds, therefore, it seems better to render "honour to the righteous" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a>), to the true Israel of God as a righteous people. The "uttermost part" is, literally, <span class= "ital">the wing </span>or <span class= "ital">skirt </span>of the earth.<p><span class= "bld">But I said, My leanness, my leanness . . .</span>--The prophet is recalled from the ideal to the actual, from the glory of the future to the shame and misery of the present. "Leanness," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm" title="I may tell all my bones: they look and stare on me.">Psalm 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm" title="My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh fails of fatness.">Psalm 109:24</a>, was the natural symbol of extremest sorrow. In the "treacherous dealers," literally, <span class= "ital">robbers, </span>or <span class= "ital">barbarians, </span>we may find primarily the Assyrian invaders, who were making the country desolate, or the unjust rulers of Judah, who oppressed the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Glory to the righteous</span>. The righteous remnant perceive that the calamities which have come upon the earth are ushering in a time of honor and glory for themselves; and they console themselves by making this fact the burden of some of their songs. Their honor, it must be remembered, is bound up with God's glory; which will not shine forth fully till their salvation is complete, and they "reign with him" in glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But I said, My leanness</span>. The thought of this joyful time, when the saints shall reign with their Lord in a new heaven and a new earth, recalls the prophet (contrast being one of the laws of the association of ideas) to the misery of the present, and his own participation therein. A time of suffering, of wasting, and pining away must be endured - for how long he knows not - before the joyous consummation, towards which he stretches in hope and confident expectancy, can be reached. This is the period of his "leanness." The <span class="cmt_word">treacherous dealers</span>, or ungodly of the earth, will bear sway during this period, and will <span class="cmt_word">deal treacherously</span> and cruelly with God's saints, persecuting them incessantly in a thousand ways. <span class="cmt_word">Have dealt</span>. The perfect of prophetic certainty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:16-23 Believers may be driven into the uttermost parts of the earth; but they are singing, not sighing. Here is terror to sinners; the prophet laments the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; and the small number of believers. He foresees that sin would abound. The meaning is plain, that evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain are all these things. Worldly men think to dwell in the earth as in a palace, as in a castle; but it shall be removed like a cottage, like a lodge put up for the night. It shall fall and not rise again; but there shall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell nothing but righteousness. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, under which it groans now, and will sink at last. The high ones, that are puffed up with their grandeur, that think themselves out of the reach of danger, God will visit for their pride and cruelty. Let us judge nothing before the time, though some shall be visited. None in this world should be secure, though their condition be ever so prosperous; nor need any despair, though their condition be ever so deplorable. God will be glorified in all this. But the mystery of Providence is not yet finished. The ruin of the Redeemer's enemies must make way for his kingdom, and then the Sun of Righteousness will appear in full glory. Happy are those who take warning by the sentence against others; every impenitent sinner will sink under his transgression, and rise no more, while believers enjoy everlasting bliss.</body></html>
