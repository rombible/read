and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm" title="So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.">Isaiah 59:19</a>), and, we may add, to the like formula in Assyrian inscriptions, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>that of Esarhaddon (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>iii. 111). So Homer, <span class= "ital">"</span>the dawn and the sun" (<span class= "ital">Il, </span>xii. 239) as a phrase for the East; and our Orient and East have substantially the same significance. (2) It has been rendered simply "regions," or "countries" (Cheyne). (3) It has been interpreted of the "fiery trial" of tribulation, or of the "light" of Divine truth. Of these, (1) has the merit of being more in harmony with the primary meaning of the word, and giving a more vivid antithesis. The "isles of the sea" we have met in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires.</span> The reading <span class="accented">baiyyim</span>, "in the fires," is doubtful. If it be regarded as sound, we must understand the "fiery trials" which were coming on the faithful remnant. But the LXX. seems to have had the reading <span class="accented">baiyyim</span>, "in the islands" or "in the coasts;" and so Lowth, Hitzig, and Mr. Oheyne. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:13-15 There shall be a remnant preserved from the general ruin, and it shall be a devout and pious remnant. These few are dispersed; like the gleanings of the olive tree, hid under the leaves. The Lord knows those that are his; the world does not. When the mirth of carnal worldlings ceases, the joy of the saints is as lively as ever, because the covenant of grace, the fountain of their comforts, and the foundation of their hopes, never fails. Those who rejoice in the Lord can rejoice in tribulation, and by faith may triumph when all about them are in tears. They encourage their fellow-sufferers to do likewise, even those who are in the furnace of affliction. Or, in the valleys, low, dark, miry places. In every fire, even the hottest, in every place, even the remotest, let us keep up our good thoughts of God. If none of these trials move us, then we glorify the Lord in the fires.</body></html>
