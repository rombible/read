And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), which are here the symbol of the abyss of Hades, in which the rebel powers of earth and heaven await the final judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">After many days shall they be visited.</span>--The verb is the same as that translated "punish" in the previous verse, but does not in itself involve the idea of punishing, and in some of its forms is used of visiting in mercy. Interpreters have, according to their previous bias, assigned this or that meaning to it. Probably the prophet used it in a neutral sense, drawing his imagery from the custom of Eastern kings, who, after leaving their enemies in prison for an appointed time, came to inspect them, and to award punishment or pardon according to their deserts. In such a company there might be "prisoners of hope" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-12.htm" title="Turn you to the strong hold, you prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double to you;">Zechariah 9:12</a>), waiting with eager expectation for the coming of the king. The passage is interesting in the history of Christian doctrine, as having furnished to Origen and his followers an argument in favour of the ultimate restitution of all created spirits.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the pit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in a dungeon</span>. Mr. Cheyne suggests that <span class="accented">sheol</span>, or "hell," is meant; but the context points to some narrower confinement. <span class="cmt_word">In the prison</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in prison</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After many days</span>. In the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>) Satan is bound "a thousand years;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an indefinite term. The imprisonment of the present passage is scarcely the same, but it is analogous. God's purposes require sometimes long periods of inaction. <span class="cmt_word">Shall they be visited</span>; or, <span class="accented">published</span>. The word is the same as that translated "punish" in ver. 21. "Visiting" for good is scarcely to be thought of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:16-23 Believers may be driven into the uttermost parts of the earth; but they are singing, not sighing. Here is terror to sinners; the prophet laments the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; and the small number of believers. He foresees that sin would abound. The meaning is plain, that evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain are all these things. Worldly men think to dwell in the earth as in a palace, as in a castle; but it shall be removed like a cottage, like a lodge put up for the night. It shall fall and not rise again; but there shall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell nothing but righteousness. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, under which it groans now, and will sink at last. The high ones, that are puffed up with their grandeur, that think themselves out of the reach of danger, God will visit for their pride and cruelty. Let us judge nothing before the time, though some shall be visited. None in this world should be secure, though their condition be ever so prosperous; nor need any despair, though their condition be ever so deplorable. God will be glorified in all this. But the mystery of Providence is not yet finished. The ruin of the Redeemer's enemies must make way for his kingdom, and then the Sun of Righteousness will appear in full glory. Happy are those who take warning by the sentence against others; every impenitent sinner will sink under his transgression, and rise no more, while believers enjoy everlasting bliss.</body></html>
