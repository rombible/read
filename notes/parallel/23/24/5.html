Hitherto the prophet has been concerned with the mere fact of a terrible judgment to be sent by God upon the whole world. Now he sets forth the cause of the fact. It is the old cause, which has reduced so many lauds to desolation, and which in the far-off times produced the Flood, viz. the wickedness of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-13</a>). The earth is "defiled" or "polluted" by the sins of its inhabitants, and has to be purged from the defilement by suffering. <span class="cmt_word">They have transgressed the laws</span>. Apart from both Judaism and Christianity, all mankind have been placed by God under a double law: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The "law written in their hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>), which speaks to them through their consciences, and lays them under an obligation that cannot be gainsaid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The law of positive commands, given to the entire human race through the common progenitors, Adam and Noah, which is obligatory upon all to whom it has been traditionally handed down; but which has been only very partially handed down, and it is not generally felt as obligatory. Mankind has in all ages largely transgressed both laws, and both would seem to be pointed at in the present passage. The transgression of the "law written in the heart" is doubtless that which especially calls down God's vengeance, and makes him from time to time execute wrath on the whole world. Changed the ordinance; rather, <span class="accented">broken</span>, <span class="accented">violated</span>. Transgression in act is intended, not formal abrogation of the Divine ordinances. Broken the everlasting covenant. Mr. Cheyne supposes an allusion to the covenant made with Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-16.htm">Genesis 9:16</a>); but it seems better to understand that "everlasting covenant" which exists between God and man, in virtue of the nature wherewith God has endowed man, and of the laws which he Ires impressed upon man's con. science. Sophocles well says of these laws, that they are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x39d;&#x39b;&#x1ffd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f4c;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> Or - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Laws that walk on high, begot and bred<br />In upper air, whose only sire is Heaven;<br />Nor did the race of mortals give them birth,<br />Nor will oblivion ever cause them sleep."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 All whose treasures and happiness are laid up on earth, will soon be brought to want and misery. It is good to apply to ourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can take their joy from them.</body></html>
