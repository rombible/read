Of these Assyria was then the most prominent within the horizon of the prophet's view; but Moab appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a>, and the language, with that exception, seems deliberately generalised, as if to paint the general discomfiture in every age (and, above all, in the great age of the future Deliverer) of the enemies of Jehovah and His people. The Hebrew word for "earth" admits (as elsewhere) of the rendering "land"; but here the wider meaning seems to predominate, as in its union with the "world," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-4.htm" title="The earth mourns and fades away, the world languishes and fades away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.">Isaiah 24:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-20.</span> - GOD'S JUDGMENTS ON THE WORLD AT LARGE. From special denunciations of woe upon particular nations - Baby-loll, Assyria, Philistia, Moab, Syria of Damascus, Egypt and Ethiopia, Arabia, Judea, Tyre - the prophet passes to denunciations of a broader character, involving the future of the whole world. This section of his work extends from the commencement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>. to the conclusion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27</a>, thus including four chapters. The world at large is the general subject of the entire prophecy; but the "peculiar people" still maintains a marked and prominent place, as spiritually the leading country, and as one in whose fortunes the world at large would be always vitally concerned (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6, 9, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty</span>. Several critics (Lowth, Ewald, Gesenius, Knobel) prefer to render, "maketh the <span class="accented">land</span> empty;" but the broader view, which is maintained by Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kay, Cheyne, and others, seems preferable. The mention of "the world" in ver. 4, and of "the-kings of the earth" in ver. 21, implies a wider field of survey than the Holy Land. Of course the expression, "maketh empty," is rhetorical, some remarkable, but not complete, depopulation being pointed at (comp. ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">Turneth it upside down</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Scattereth abroad the inhabitants</span>. The scanty population left is dispersed, and not allowed to collect into masses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 All whose treasures and happiness are laid up on earth, will soon be brought to want and misery. It is good to apply to ourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can take their joy from them.</body></html>
