The earth totters under the weight of its iniquity, and falls (we must remember the Hebrew idea of the world as resting upon pillars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-8.htm" title="He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he has set the world on them.">1Samuel 2:8</a>), never to rise again. In its vision of the last things the picture finds a parallel, though under different imagery, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10-13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth... shall be removed like a cottage</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sways to and fro like a hammock</span>, Rosenm&uuml;ller observes, "Alludit ad <span class="accented">pensiles lectos</span>, quos, metu ferrarum, in arboribus sibi parare solent, istis in terris, non custodes solum hortorum camporumve, sed et iter facientes." <span class="cmt_word">The transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the earth perishes on account of men's sins. <span class="cmt_word">It shall fall, and not rise again</span>. The present earth is to disappear altogether, and to be superseded by "a new heaven and a new earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:16-23 Believers may be driven into the uttermost parts of the earth; but they are singing, not sighing. Here is terror to sinners; the prophet laments the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; and the small number of believers. He foresees that sin would abound. The meaning is plain, that evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain are all these things. Worldly men think to dwell in the earth as in a palace, as in a castle; but it shall be removed like a cottage, like a lodge put up for the night. It shall fall and not rise again; but there shall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell nothing but righteousness. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, under which it groans now, and will sink at last. The high ones, that are puffed up with their grandeur, that think themselves out of the reach of danger, God will visit for their pride and cruelty. Let us judge nothing before the time, though some shall be visited. None in this world should be secure, though their condition be ever so prosperous; nor need any despair, though their condition be ever so deplorable. God will be glorified in all this. But the mystery of Providence is not yet finished. The ruin of the Redeemer's enemies must make way for his kingdom, and then the Sun of Righteousness will appear in full glory. Happy are those who take warning by the sentence against others; every impenitent sinner will sink under his transgression, and rise no more, while believers enjoy everlasting bliss.</body></html>
