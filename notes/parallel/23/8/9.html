No plan against the Divine kingdom, of which the earthly kingdom of the house of David was, for the time, the representative, shall prosper.

It is impossible to obtain this meaning from the existing Hebrew text, which must be translated, "Be <span class="accented">ahoy</span>," or "<span class="accented">Rage"</span> ("Make an uproar," Revised Version). The prophet passes from the consideration of the opposition offered to Jehovah by <span class="accented">Israel</span>, Syria, and Assyria, to a general consideration of all the nations of the earth.

Their efforts would be vain, and themselves broken to pieces. It concerns us, in time of trouble, to watch against all such fears as put us upon crooked courses for our own security. The believing fear of God preserves against the disquieting fear of man. If we thought rightly of the greatness and glory of God, we should see all the power of our enemies restrained. The Lord, who will be a Sanctuary to those who trust in him, will be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those who make the creature their fear and their hope. If the things of God be an offence to us, they will undo us. The apostle quotes this as to all who persisted in unbelief of the gospel of Christ, 1Pe 2:8. The crucified Emmanuel, who was and is a Stumbling-stone and Rock of offence to unbelieving Jews, is no less so to thousands who are called Christians. The preaching of the cross is foolishness in their esteem; his doctrines and precepts offend them.</body></html>
