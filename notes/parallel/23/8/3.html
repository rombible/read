Elsewhere, however, as in the case of Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>) and Huldah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2Chronicles 34:22</a>), it implies prophetic gifts. Possibly, therefore, we may think of the prophet and his wife as having been drawn together by united thoughts and counsels, in contrast with the celibate life of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-2.htm" title="You shall not take you a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters in this place.">Jeremiah 16:2</a>), the miseries of Hosea's marriage (Hosea 1, 2), and the sudden bereavement of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/24-16.htm" title="Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.">Ezekiel 24:16-18</a>). We may, perhaps, trace, on this view, the wife's hand in the toilet inventory of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The prophetess</span>. It is not necessary to suppose that the wife of Isaiah must have uttered prophecies because she is called "the prophetess." Titles were given in the East to the wives, daughters, etc., of officials, which merely reflected the dignity of their husbands, fathers, etc. Even Miriam seems to be called a "prophetess" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>) from her close relationship to Moses, rather than from any supernatural power that she had. In the Mishna, a priest's wife or daughter is called "priestess" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Call his name.</span> There is no reason for doubting that the name was actually given. Other Israelites had such names as Jushab-hosed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a>), Haah-ashtari (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-6.htm">1 Chronicles 4:6</a>), Romamti-ezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>), Machnadebai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-40.htm">Ezra 10:40</a>), and the like. Assyrian names were even longer; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, As-shur-bel-nisi-su, Asshur-kinat-ili-kain, etc. In ordinary parlance, names of this type were commonly shortened, "Shalman-eser' becoming "Shalmau" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), "Sennacherib Jareb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>), and the like. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-8 The prophet is to write on a large roll, or on a metal tablet, words which meant, Make speed to spoil, hasten to the prey: pointing out that the Assyrian army should come with speed, and make great spoil. Very soon the riches of Damascus and of Samaria, cities then secure and formidable, shall be taken away by the king of Assyria. The prophet pleads with the promised Messiah, who should appear in that land in the fulness of time, and, therefore, as God, would preserve it in the mean time. As a gentle brook is an apt emblem of a mild government, so an overflowing torrent represents a conqueror and tyrant. The invader's success was also described by a bird of prey, stretching its wings over the whole land. Those who reject Christ, will find that what they call liberty is the basest slavery. But no enemy shall pluck the believer out of Emmanuel's hand, or deprive him of his heavenly inheritance.</body></html>
