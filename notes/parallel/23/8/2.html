And the witnesses whom the prophet calls were probably men of high position, among those who had been foremost in advising the alliance with Assyria. Of Uriah or Urijah, the priest, we know that he complied with the king's desire to introduce an altar after the pattern which he had seen at Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10-11</a>). Of Zechariah we know nothing; but the name was a priestly one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2Chronicles 24:20</a>), and it has been conjectured, from his association with Isaiah, that he may have been the writer of a section of the book that bears the name of a later Zechariah (Zechariah 9-12), which bears traces of being of a much earlier date than the rest of the book. The combination of "Zachariah, son of Jeberechiah" reminds us of Zacharias, the son of Barachias, and points to a priestly family. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-13.htm" title="And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:">2Chronicles 29:13</a> the name appears as belonging to the Asaph section of the Levites. A more probable view is that he was identical with the father of the queen then reigning, and was therefore the grandfather of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.">2Chronicles 29:1</a>). Probably, looking to the prophet's habit of tracing auguries in names, the two witnesses may have been partly chosen for the significance of those which they bore, Uriah, <span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>Jah is my light," Zechariah, <span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>Jah will remember," each of which comes in with a special appropriateness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I took unto me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and I will have taken for me</span>. It is still God who is speaking. <span class="cmt_word">Uriah the priest</span>. Probably the high priest of the time, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-16</a>, as the ready tool of Ahaz at a later date. Though a bad man, he may have been a trustworthy witness to a fact. <span class="cmt_word">Zechariah</span>. Perhaps the father of Abi or Abijah, Ahaz's queen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-1.htm">2 Chronicles 29:1</a>). It would serve to call public attention still more to the tablet, if it bore the names of two such eminent persons as witnesses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-8 The prophet is to write on a large roll, or on a metal tablet, words which meant, Make speed to spoil, hasten to the prey: pointing out that the Assyrian army should come with speed, and make great spoil. Very soon the riches of Damascus and of Samaria, cities then secure and formidable, shall be taken away by the king of Assyria. The prophet pleads with the promised Messiah, who should appear in that land in the fulness of time, and, therefore, as God, would preserve it in the mean time. As a gentle brook is an apt emblem of a mild government, so an overflowing torrent represents a conqueror and tyrant. The invader's success was also described by a bird of prey, stretching its wings over the whole land. Those who reject Christ, will find that what they call liberty is the basest slavery. But no enemy shall pluck the believer out of Emmanuel's hand, or deprive him of his heavenly inheritance.</body></html>
