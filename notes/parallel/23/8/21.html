The abruptness with which the verse opens, the absence of any noun to which the pronoun "it" may refer, has led some critics (Cheyne) to transpose the two verses. So arranged, the thought of the people for whom there is no dawning passes naturally into the picture of their groping in that thick darkness. and then the misery of that midnight wandering is aggravated by the horrors of starvation. The words may point to the horrors of a literal famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm" title="The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.">Isaiah 2:11</a>); but as the darkness is clearly figurative, so probably is the hunger--not a famine of bread, but of hearing the word of the Lord. The Authorised version rightly translates the indefinite singular by the plural.<p><span class= "bld">When they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves.</span>--The faithful who waited for the Lord might bear even that darkness and that hunger, as soldiers bear their night-march fasting before the battle. Not so with the panic-stricken and superstitious crowd. With them despair would show itself in curses. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-11.htm" title="And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.">Revelation 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-21.htm" title="And there fell on men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.">Revelation 16:21</a>.) They would curse at once the king who had led them to destruction, and the God whom they had neglected. Possibly the words may mean, "the king who is also their God," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a> (Heb.) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a>; but the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm" title="And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.">1Kings 21:13</a> is in favour of the more literal meaning. The "upward" look is, we must remember, that of despair and defiance, not of hope. Upwards, downwards, behind, before, there is nothing for them but the darkness in which they are driven, or drifting onward. All seems utterly hopeless. Like Dante, they find themselves in a land "where silent is the sun."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22</span> are supposed by some to be cut of place, and to belong properly to the description of the Assyrian invasion, given in vers. 7, 8. But this bold solution of a difficulty is scarcely to be commended, there being no limit to its use. An order followed in all the manuscripts should not be disturbed, if it gives any tolerable sense. Such a sense can, it is thought, be found here by regarding the two verses as exegetical of the last clause of ver. 20 - "when there is no dawn for them." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall pass through it</span>. "It," which is feminine, must mean "the land." The Jews left in it shall wander about it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-21.htm">Isaiah 7:21-25</a>), seeking pasture for the remnant of their cattle. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fret themselves</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they shall be deeply angered</span> (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And curse their king and their God</span>. As the causes of their sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">And look upward</span>. Not in hope, but in rage and defiance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:17-22 The prophet foresaw that the Lord would hide his face; but he would look for his return in favour to them again. Though not miraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suited to excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel in difficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolish and sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to the testimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek to familiar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shall be horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way of all good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. They shall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And their fears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut their eyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness. All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are as nothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words of Christ, to follow delusions.</body></html>
