Each was a <span class= "ital">nomen et omen </span>for those who had ears to hear. Could the disciples of Isaiah complain that they had no light thrown upon the future, when, so to say, they had those embodied prophecies? The children disappear from the scene, and we know nothing of their after-history, but all their life long, even with or without a special prophetic work, they must have been, by virtue of their names, witnesses to a later generation, of what Isaiah had predicted. In Isaiah's own life, as including symbolic acts as well as prophetic words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>), we have a further development of the thought that he was "a sign and a wonder." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-11.htm" title="Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall remove and go into captivity.">Ezekiel 12:11</a>.) The citation of the words, "I and the children whom thou hast given me," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-13.htm" title="And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.">Hebrews 2:13</a>, is noticeable here chiefly as showing how little the writer of that Epistle cared in this and other quotations for the original meaning of the words as determined by the context. It was enough for him that the Christ, like the prophet, did not stand alone, but claimed a fellowship with the children whom the Father had given him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>), as being alike servants and children of God, called to do His will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I and the children... are for signs.</span> Isaiah's children seem to have been "for signs," especially in respect of their names. Shear-Jashub meant "A remnant shall return" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>), and thus held out two hopes; one that a remnant of Israel would return to God and become his true servants, another that a remnant would return from the captivity that had been prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>). Maher-shalal-hash-baz - "Plunder speeds, spoil hastens" - was a "sign" of a different kind. Primarily, his name referred to the spoiling of Damascus and Samaria (vers. 3, 4); but it may further have indicated a time of general disturbance, plunder, and ravage. It is not quite clear in what respects Isaiah was a "sign." Perhaps he, too, in his name, which meant "(Our) salvation is Jehovah" - certainly also in his symbolical acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>), and possibly in the firmness of his faith, which never wavered. <span class="cmt_word">From the Lord of hosts</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from by the Lord of hosts -</span> an expression like the French <span class="accented">de chez</span>. God had supernaturally appointed the sign in one case (vers. 1-4), but in the other two had merely brought them about by the secret working of his providence. But the prophet treats all three as coming equally from him. <span class="cmt_word">Which dwelleth in Mount Zion</span>. Hero, again, is encouragement. God has not quitted Zion. The Shechinah still rests between the cherubim in the holy of holies. While this is so, God is still <span class="accented">with</span> his people (Immanuel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:17-22 The prophet foresaw that the Lord would hide his face; but he would look for his return in favour to them again. Though not miraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suited to excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel in difficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolish and sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to the testimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek to familiar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shall be horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way of all good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. They shall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And their fears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut their eyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness. All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are as nothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words of Christ, to follow delusions.</body></html>
