Why should not they do as others did, and consult the soothsayers, who were in such great demand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>), as to the anxious secrets of the coming years. The words point to some of the many forms of such soothsaying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). The "familiar spirit" (the English term being a happy paraphrase rather than a translation), is closely connected, as in the case of the witch of Endor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/28-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me to battle, you and your men.">1Samuel 28:1-20</a>), with the idea of necromancy, i.e., with the claim to have a demon or spirit of divination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16</a>), on the part of the wizards (comp. Hom. <span class= "ital">Il. </span>xxiii. 10; Virg. <span class= "ital">?n</span>., vi. 492) that "peep" (old English for "pipe," "chirp," "whisper") "and mutter." This peculiar intonation, thrilling each nerve with a sense of expectant awe, seems to have been characteristic of the soothsayers of Isaiah's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Should not a people seek unto their God? . . .</span>--That, the prophet says, is the only true pathway to such knowledge as is good for man. The latter part of the question is abruptly elliptical: <span class= "ital">Are men to seek on behalf of the living to the dead? </span>What ground, he seems to ask, have we for thinking that the spirits of the dead can be recalled to earth, or, if that were possible, that they know more than the living do? May it not even be that they know less? The prophet views the state of the departed as Hezekiah views it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18</a>), as one, not of annihilation, but of dormant or weakened powers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - ISAIAH RECOMMENDS LOOKING TO GOD AND THE REVEALED WORD RATHER THAN TO NECROMANCY. AFFLICTION WILL BRING ISRAEL TO GOD. Isaiah returns, in ver. 19, to the consideration of his disciples. In the terrible times impending, they will be recommended to have recourse to necromancy; he urges that they should look to God and the Law. He then further suggests that, in the coming affliction which he describes (vers. 21, 22), men will generally turn for relief to the same quarter (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seek unto them that have familiar spirits.</span> In times of great distress the Israelites seem always to have been tempted to consult those among them who pretended to magic and divination. So Saul in the Philistine war resorted to the witch of Endor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-20</a>); Manasseh, threatened by Esar-haddon, "used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Israel generally, oppressed by Syria and Assyria, "used divination and enchantments" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>). There was the same inclination now on the part of many Jews. The vexed question of the actual powers possessed by such persons cannot be discussed within the limits of a footnote. It has, moreover, already been treated in the present Commentary, in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Wizards that peep, and that mutter</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that chirp and mutter</span>. Tricks of the ventriloquists, probably, who disguised their voices, and represented that they were the voices of ghosts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>). The natural speech of some tribes has been compared to the "chirping of birds" (Herod., 4:183; Hornemann, 'Travels,' p. 119). <span class="cmt_word">Should not a people</span>, etc.? Very abrupt and elliptical Isaiah means to say, "Do not attend to them; but answer, Should not a people," etc.? <span class="cmt_word">For the living</span>. This may either mean "<span class="accented">instead of the</span> living," or "on behalf of the living seek to the dead?" or, Would not that be plainly preposterous? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:17-22 The prophet foresaw that the Lord would hide his face; but he would look for his return in favour to them again. Though not miraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suited to excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel in difficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolish and sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to the testimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek to familiar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shall be horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way of all good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. They shall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And their fears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut their eyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness. All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are as nothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words of Christ, to follow delusions.</body></html>
