The hope of the psalmist fastens on the thought, "the Lord of hosts is <span class= "ital">with us"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm" title="The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-11.htm" title="The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.">Psalm 46:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall pass through Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he shall</span> pass on <span class="accented">into Judah</span> ("He shall sweep onward into Judah," Revised Version). The <span class="accented">Assyrians</span> will not be content with invading Syria and Samaria; they will "<span class="accented">pass</span> on into Judaea." It is not clear whether this is to be done immediately by <span class="accented">Tiglath-Pileser</span>, or by one of his successors at a later date. There is reason to believe from Tiglath-Pileser's inscriptions that he used the territory of Ahaz for the passage of his armies as those of a vassal king, but did not ravage them. <span class="cmt_word">He shall reach even to the neck</span>. The Assyrian attacks on Judaea shall stop short of destroying it. The flood shall not submerge the head, but only rise as high as the neck. This prophecy was fulfilled, since it was not Assyria, but Babylon, which destroyed the Jewish kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">The stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land.</span> The Assyrian armies shall visit every part of the land. The sudden change of metaphor is in the manner of Isaiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24, 30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">O Immanuel</span>. On the importance of this address, as indicating the kingly, and so (probably) the Divine character of Immanuel, see the notes on Isaiah 7:14. Isaiah could not speak of the land as belonging to his own infant son. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-8 The prophet is to write on a large roll, or on a metal tablet, words which meant, Make speed to spoil, hasten to the prey: pointing out that the Assyrian army should come with speed, and make great spoil. Very soon the riches of Damascus and of Samaria, cities then secure and formidable, shall be taken away by the king of Assyria. The prophet pleads with the promised Messiah, who should appear in that land in the fulness of time, and, therefore, as God, would preserve it in the mean time. As a gentle brook is an apt emblem of a mild government, so an overflowing torrent represents a conqueror and tyrant. The invader's success was also described by a bird of prey, stretching its wings over the whole land. Those who reject Christ, will find that what they call liberty is the basest slavery. But no enemy shall pluck the believer out of Emmanuel's hand, or deprive him of his heavenly inheritance.</body></html>
