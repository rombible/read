(1) The confederacy has been thought to be that between Syria or Ephraim, which had at first filled the people with terror, and then had seemed so powerful that men had been willing to join it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm" title="And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.">Isaiah 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm" title="For as much as this people refuses the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;">Isaiah 8:6</a>). (2) Translating the word as <span class= "ital">conspiracy </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2Kings 17:4</a>--it was the word used by Athaliah when she cried, "Treason, treason!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-13.htm" title="And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.">2Chronicles 23:13</a>)--interpreters have seen in it the cry of the Assyrian alliance party against the prophet and his followers, whom they accused of conspiracy against their country, such as was afterwards imputed to Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-14.htm" title="Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he listened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.">Jeremiah 37:14</a>). (3) Others, following a conjectural amendment of the text, have read, "Ye shall not call everything a holy thing which this people calleth a holy thing," and find in the words a protest against the idolatrous reverence for that which has no real holiness, analogous to the warning against soothsayers or diviners in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>; or possibly an allusion to such an object of worship as the brazen serpent, which Hezekiah had destroyed by Isaiah's advice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>). Of these, (2) seems the most in harmony with the sequence of facts and thoughts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say ye not</span>. The transition from the singular to the plural is noticeable. It implies that Isaiah did not stand alone, but had followers - a "little flock," it may be - but still enough to give him the support of sympathy (comp. ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">A confederacy</span>; rather, <span class="accented">treason</span>, or <span class="accented">conspiracy</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-20.htm">1 Kings 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-9.htm">Jeremiah 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>, etc.). The command is, not to call a course of conduct treasonable simply because the people generally so call it. Jeremiah was charged with treason for preaching the hopelessness of offering resistance to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8-11</a>). Those who opposed an Assyrian alliance were probably now taxed with treason. <span class="cmt_word">To all them to whom</span>; rather, <span class="accented">everything which</span>. Translate the entire clause thus: <span class="accented">Call ye not conspiracy everything which this people shall call conspiracy</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Neither fear ye their fear</span>. They feared man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2</a>). Isaiah and his disciples are commanded to fear no one but God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:9-16 The prophet challenges the enemies of the Jews. Their efforts would be vain, and themselves broken to pieces. It concerns us, in time of trouble, to watch against all such fears as put us upon crooked courses for our own security. The believing fear of God preserves against the disquieting fear of man. If we thought rightly of the greatness and glory of God, we should see all the power of our enemies restrained. The Lord, who will be a Sanctuary to those who trust in him, will be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those who make the creature their fear and their hope. If the things of God be an offence to us, they will undo us. The apostle quotes this as to all who persisted in unbelief of the gospel of Christ, 1Pe 2:8. The crucified Emmanuel, who was and is a Stumbling-stone and Rock of offence to unbelieving Jews, is no less so to thousands who are called Christians. The preaching of the cross is foolishness in their esteem; his doctrines and precepts offend them.</body></html>
