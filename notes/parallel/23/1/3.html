These know that relation, and act according to it; but Israel did not, or rather would not, know. So Jeremiah dwells, turning to a different region of animal life, on the instinct which leads the stork, the swallow, and the crane to fulfil the law of their being (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm" title="Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:7</a>), while Israel "knew not"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>did not acknowledge--the law of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ox... the ass.</span> The ox and the ass are probably selected as the least intelligent of domesticated animals (so Jerome, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and Gesenius). Yet even they recognize their owner or master. Jeremiah contrasts the brutish stupidity of Israel with the wise instinct of animals that have not been domesticated, as the stork, the turtle-dove, the crane, and the swallow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Israel doth not know;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> does not acknowledge its Master and Owner, pays him no respect, does not recognize him as either Owner or Master. <span class="cmt_word">My people.</span> Compare the formula, so frequent in Exodus, "Let <span class="accented">my people</span> go" (Exodus 7:16; 8:1, 20; 9:1, etc.). Israel was God's people by election (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>), by covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>), by pardoning grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12-17</a>). Despite all their backslidings, he had not yet cast them off. They are still "his people" in Isaiah from first to last, standing in contrast with "the nations, "or "the Gentiles, "among whom they are to be "set as a sign" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Doth net consider.</span> Gesenius translates, "doth not consider <span class="accented">thereof</span>;" Cheyne, "is without understanding." Bishop Lowth retains the words of the Authorized Version. The meaning would seem to be, "My people doth not consider <span class="accented">me</span>, cloth not reflect on my relation to them as Lord and Master." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, The salvation of the Lord; a very suitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus the Saviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.</body></html>
