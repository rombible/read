The Hebrew implies rather the tone of one who gives an authoritative <span class= "ital">ultimatum, </span>as from a judge to the accused, who had no defence, or only a sham defence, to offer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/6-2.htm" title="Hear you, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and you strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.">Micah 6:2-3</a>). "Let us sum up the pleadings--that <span class= "ital">ultimatum </span>is one of grace and mercy--'Repent, and be forgiven.'"<p><span class= "bld">Though your sins be as scarlet.</span>--The two colours probably corresponded to those now designated by the English words. Both words point to the dyes of Tyre, and the words probably received a fresh emphasis from the fact that robes of these colours were worn by the princes to whom Isaiah preached (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm" title="You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.">2Samuel 1:24</a>). To the prophet's eye that dark crimson was as the stain of blood. What Jehovah promises is that the guilt of the past, deep-dyed in grain as it might be, should be discharged, and leave the character with a restored purity. Men might dye their souls of this or that hue, but to bleach them was the work of God. He alone could <span class= "ital">transfigure </span>them that they should be "white as snow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm" title="And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.">Mark 9:3</a>). Comp. the reproduction of the thought, with the added paradox that it was the crimson "blood of the lamb" that was to bleach and cleanse, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/3-4.htm" title="You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.">Revelation 3:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come now, and let us reason together.</span> God has from time to time permitted man to reason with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm">Job 23:3-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>); but it is difficult to see that there is any "reasoning" or "controversy" here. Mr. Cheyne translates, "Let us bring our dispute to an end." <span class="cmt_word">Though your sins be as scarlet... like crimson</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "open, evident, glaring." Or there may be an allusion to their blood-guiltiness (see vers. 15, 19). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be as white as snow.</span> Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, which is completely parallel, whether it was written before or after. There can be no better image of, purity than snow (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm">Job 9:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As wool.</span> A weaker illustration than the preceding one, but needed for the parallelism. (The resemblance of falling snow to wool is noted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-16.htm">Psalm 147:16</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:16-20 Not only feel sorrow for the sin committed, but break off the practice. We must be doing, not stand idle. We must be doing the good the Lord our God requires. It is plain that the sacrifices of the law could not atone, even for outward national crimes. But, blessed be God, there is a Fountain opened, in which sinners of every age and rank may be cleansed. Though our sins have been as scarlet and crimson, a deep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original corruption, and afterwards in the many threads of actual transgression; though we have often dipped into sin, by many backslidings; yet pardoning mercy will take out the stain, Ps 51:7. They should have all the happiness and comfort they could desire. Life and death, good and evil, are set before us. O Lord, incline all of us to live to thy glory.</body></html>
