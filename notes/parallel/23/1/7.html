There had been such invasions in the days of Ahaz, in which Israel and Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.">Isaiah 7:1</a>), Edom and the Philistines, had been conspicuous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.">2Chronicles 28:17-18</a>); and the reign of Hezekiah already had witnessed that of Sargon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>).<p>The Hebrew has no copulative verb, but joins subject and predicate together with the emphasis of abruptness: <span class= "ital">Your land</span>--<span class= "ital">a desolation, </span>and so on. The repetition of the word "strangers" is characteristic of Isaiah's style.<p><span class= "bld">As overthrown by strangers.</span>--Conjectural readings give (1) "as the overthrow of Sodom;" (2) "as the overthrow of (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>wrought by) a rain-storm." The word rendered "overthrown" is elsewhere applied only to the destruction of the cities of the plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm" title="And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm" title="I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-18.htm" title="As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, said the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.">Jeremiah 49:18</a>). So taken, the clause prepares the way for the fuller comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-9.htm" title="Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:9-10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your country is desolate.</span> Metaphor is now dropped, and the prophet describes in strong but simple language the judgments of God, which have already followed the sins of the nation. First of all, their land is "a desolation." It has been recently ravaged by an enemy; the towns have been burnt, the crops devoured. There is nothing to determine who the enemy had been. Knobel supposes the Edomites and Philistines, who invaded Judaea in the time of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17, 18</a>), to be intended; Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests the Israelites under Amaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21-24</a>); while Mr. Cheyne supposes the devastation to have been wrought by the Assyrians under Sargon. If we could be assured that the prophecies of Isaiah are arranged in chronological order, we should either have to accept Rosenm&uuml;ller's view, or to suppose some invasion of Judaea to have taken place in the later years of Uzziah of which no mention is made by the authors of Kings and Chronicles; but it is impossible to be certain on what principle Isaiah's prophecies are arranged. The mention of "strangers" is in favor of the enemy having been actual foreigners, and therefore not the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Your cities are burned with fire.</span> The common fate of cities taken in war. In the Assyrian sculptures we often see the torch applied to them. <span class="cmt_word">Your land.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, "your <span class="accented">tillage</span>." <span class="accented">Adamah</span> means "soil" or "ground" generally; but here no doubt denotes the ground which bore crops. <span class="cmt_word">Strangers devour it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "foreigners" others than the sons of the soil - not necessarily persons of a different race, but still probably such persons. <span class="cmt_word">In your presence</span>; before your eyes, as you look on - an aggravation of the affliction. It is <span class="cmt_word">desolate, as overthrown by strangers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it is a desolation</span>, <span class="accented">like an overthrow by strangers</span>. The near approach to repetition displeases moderns, who conjecture <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that <span class="accented">zarim</span>, strangers, has another meaning, and should be here translated by "inundation" or "deluge" (Aben Ezra, Michaelis, Lowth); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it is a wrong reading, and should Be altered into <span class="accented">sodim</span>, a word not <span class="accented">very</span> different (Ewald, Cheyne). But "the return to words whose sounds are yet lingering in the ear" is characteristic of ancient writing, and a favorite practice of Isaiah's (Kay). The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore stand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, The salvation of the Lord; a very suitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus the Saviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.</body></html>
