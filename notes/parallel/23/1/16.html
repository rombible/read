God, having put aside the worthless plea of outward religiousness made by his people, goes on to declare, by the mouth of his prophet, what he requires. First, in general terms (ver. 16), and then with distinct specification (ver. 17), he calls on them to amend their ways, both negatively ("cease to do evil") and positively ("learn to do well"). If they will really amend, then he assures them of forgiveness and favor; if they refuse and continue their rebellion, the sword will devour them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wash you, make you clean</span>. The analogy of sin to defilement, and of washing to cleansing from sin, has been felt among men universally wherever there has been any sense of sin. Outward purification by water has been constantly made use of as typical of the recovery of inward purity. Hence the numerous washings of the Levitical Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7, 8, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a>; etc.); hence the ablutions of the priests in Egypt (Herod., 2:37); hence the appropriateness of the rite of baptism; hence the symbolical washing of hands to free from complicity in blood-guiltiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>). "Wash you, make you clean, "could not be misunderstood by the Israelites; they would know that it was a requirement to "wash their hands in innocency" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>), even apart from what follows. <span class="cmt_word">Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.</span> Not "hide it, "for that was impossible; but remove it altogether - in other words, "cease from it." "Cast off all the works of darkness;" get rid of evil, to begin with. So much is negative. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:16-20 Not only feel sorrow for the sin committed, but break off the practice. We must be doing, not stand idle. We must be doing the good the Lord our God requires. It is plain that the sacrifices of the law could not atone, even for outward national crimes. But, blessed be God, there is a Fountain opened, in which sinners of every age and rank may be cleansed. Though our sins have been as scarlet and crimson, a deep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original corruption, and afterwards in the many threads of actual transgression; though we have often dipped into sin, by many backslidings; yet pardoning mercy will take out the stain, Ps 51:7. They should have all the happiness and comfort they could desire. Life and death, good and evil, are set before us. O Lord, incline all of us to live to thy glory.</body></html>
