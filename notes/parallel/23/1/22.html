(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/6-28.htm" title="They are all grievous rebels, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.">Jeremiah 6:28-30</a>.) Hypocrisy and adulteration were the order of the day. The coinage of judgment and justice was debased; the wine of spiritual life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm" title="Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.">Proverbs 9:5</a>), of enthusiasm and zeal for good, was diluted till it had lost all power to strengthen and refresh. In "the salt that has lost its savour" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.">Matthew 5:13</a> we have a like symbolism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy silver is become dross</span>. Primarily, "thy great men have deteriorated." From pure silver, they have become mere dross, the vile refuse of the smelted ore, only fit to be cast away as worthless. But per-Imps there is some further reference to <span class="accented">all</span> that was once precious in Jerusalem; there had been a general deterioration - all the silver was now a debased metal of no value. <span class="cmt_word">Thy wine mixed with water</span>. A parallelism; but (as so often happens) a weakened iteration of the preceding sentiment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-31 Neither holy cities nor royal ones are faithful to their trust, if religion does not dwell in them. Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?</body></html>
