The idea of prostitution as representing apostasy from Jehovah was involved in the thought that Israel was the bride whom He had wooed and won (Hosea 1-3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm" title="Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). The imagery was made more impressive by the fact that actual prostitution entered so largely into the ritual of many of the forms of idolatry to which the Israelites were tempted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/25-1.htm" title="And Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to commit prostitution with the daughters of Moab.">Numbers 25:1-2</a>). So Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/16-1.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 16:1-14</a>) develops the symbolism with an almost terrible fulness. So our Lord spoke of the Pharisees as an "adulterous generation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>). The fact that Hosea, an earlier contemporary, had been led to tell how he had been taught the truth thus set forth by a living personal experience, is not without significance in its bearing on the <span class= "ital">genesis </span>of Isaiah's thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">Righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">assassins. </span>The word implies not casual homicide, but something like the choice of murder and robbery as a profession. Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-9.htm" title="And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.">Hosea 6:9</a>) had painted a like picture as true of Samaria. The traveller who sojourned in Jerusalem, the poor who lived there, were exposed to outrage and murder; and all this was passing before men's eyes at the very time when they were boasting, as it were, of their "glorious reformation."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - ISAIAH'S LAMENT OVER JERUSALEM. The exhortation to amendment has been made - the results have been set forth; the temporal reward has been promised; the temporal vengeance, unless they amend, threatened. Time must be allowed the people for the prophet's words to reach them, and do their work upon them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either soften or harden them. Meanwhile, Isaiah reflects on the condition of Jerusalem, and the unlikelihood of its rulers turning to God in consequence of his preaching. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - How is the faithful city become an harlot! Not here an idolatress, but one that has left her first love, and turned to other attractions. Faithful once to her lord her spouse (Cant., <span class="accented">passim</span>), she has now cast him off - she is an adulterous wife, she no longer obeys or loves her husband. <span class="cmt_word">It was full of judgment</span>; <span class="cmt_word">righteousness</span>, etc. "She that was full" (Revised Version). Under Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-28</a>) and again under Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5-11</a>). It is not clear when the systematic perversion of justice by the rulers began. Perhaps it originated in the latter part of Uzziah's reign, when the royal authority was weakened by being divided between Uzziah and Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But now murderers</span> (see the last note on ver. 15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:21-31 Neither holy cities nor royal ones are faithful to their trust, if religion does not dwell in them. Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?</body></html>
