And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.">1Samuel 3:1</a>), is the correlative of the old term "seer," as applied to the prophet himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm" title="(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)">1Samuel 9:9</a>). The latter fell into disuse, probably because the pretenders to the clairvoyance which it implied brought it into discredit. The prophet, however, did not cease to be a "seer;" and to see visions was still one of the highest forms of the gift of the spirit of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>). It describes the state, more or less ecstatic, in which the prophet sees what others do not see, the things that are yet to come, the unseen working of the eternal laws of God. As compared with "the word of the Lord," it indicates a higher intensity of the ecstatic state; but the two terms were closely associated, and, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1</a>, a man was said to <span class= "ital">see </span>"the word of the Lord." Judah and Jerusalem are named as the centre, though not the limit, of the prophet's work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - TITLE OF THE WORK. It is questioned whether the title can be regarded as Isaiah's, or as properly belonging to the work, and it is suggested that it is rather a heading invented by a collector who brought together into a volume such prophecies of Isaiah as were known to him, the collection being a much smaller one than that which was made ultimately. In favor of this view it is urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the prophecies, as we have them, do not all "concern Judah and Jerusalem;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is a mistake in the title, which Isaiah could not have made, none of the prophecies belonging to the reign of Uzziah. But it may be answered, that, in the scriptural sense, <span class="accented">all</span> and Jerusalem, prophecy "concerns Judah and Jerusalem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people and city of God; and, further, that it is quite impossible to prove that no part of the "vision" was seen in the reign of Uzziah. There are no means of knowing whether Isaiah collected his prophecies into a volume himself or whether the collection was the work of others. In either case, the existing title must be regarded as designed for the entire work. All the earlier prophecies - those of Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, and Zephaniah - have some title introducing them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vision</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>). The term is probably used in a collective sense, but is also intended to suggest the intrinsic unity of the entire body of prophecies put forth by Isaiah. As prophets were originally called "seers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>), so prophecy was called "vision;" and this latter use continued long after the other (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm">1 Chronicles 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Isaiah the son of Amoz</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-1.htm">Isaiah 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-2.htm">Isaiah 37:2</a>; etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-32.htm">2 Chronicles 32:32</a>). The signification of the name <span class="accented">Isaiah</span> is "the salvation of Jehovah." The name Amen (<span class="accented">Amots</span>) is not to be confused with Amos ('<span class="accented">Amos</span>), who seems to have been a contemporary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</span> The prophecies of Isaiah concern primarily the kingdom of Judah, not that of Israel. They embrace a vast variety of nations and countries (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13, 15</a>. - 21, 23, 47.); but these nations and countries are spoken of "only because of the relation in which they stand to Judah and Jerusalem" (Kay), or at any rate to the people of God, symbolized under those names. Jerusalem occupies a prominent place in the prophecies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a>. 1-8; 31:4-9, etc<span class="cmt_word">.). In the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.</span> Uzziah (or Azariah, as he is sometimes called) reigned fifty-two years - probably from <span class="date">B.C. 811</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>; Jotham sixteen years - from <span class="date">B.C. 759</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>; Ahaz also sixteen years - from <span class="date">B.C. 743</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>; and Hezekiah twenty-nine years - from <span class="date">B.C. 727</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>. Isaiah probably prophesied only in the later years of Uzziah, say from <span class="date">B.C. 760</span>; but as he certainly continued his prophetical career tin Sennacherib's invasion of Judaea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-5.htm">Isaiah 37:5</a>), which was not earlier than <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, he must have exercised the prophet's office for at least fifty-six years. The lowest possible estimate of the duration of his ministry is forty-seven years - from the last year of Uzziah, <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>, to the fourteenth of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>). The highest known to us is sixty-four years - from the fourth year before Uzziah's death ( <span class="date">B.C. 762</span>) to the last year of Hezekiah ( <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>). (See 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 5. p. 5.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, The salvation of the Lord; a very suitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus the Saviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.</body></html>
