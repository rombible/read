The Syriac version and some modern scholars (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Cheyne) adopt a reading which gives <span class= "ital">to see my face. </span>In either case the implied thought is that the worshippers believed they came into the more immediate presence of Jehovah when, they entered the Temple courts. To "appear before God" was the normal phrase for visiting the Temple at the three great Feasts and other solemn occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-23.htm" title="Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.">Exodus 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm" title="My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say to me, Where is your God?">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm" title="They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.">Psalm 84:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye come to appear before me.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, "to see my face;" but most other commentators (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Ewald, Kay) regard the phrase used as equivalent to that employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-23.htm">Exodus 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>; and the passage as referring to that attendance in the temple at the three great annual festivals, which was required of all adult male Israelites. The requirement of the Law was still observed in the letter, but not in the <span class="cmt_word">spirit</span>. They came with no true religious object. Hence the question which follows: <span class="cmt_word">Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span> <span class="accented">This</span> was not what God had enjoined - a mere bodily attendance, a <span class="accented">trampling</span> of his courts with their feet, when their hearts were far from him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Judea was desolate, and their cities burned. This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.</body></html>
