It is noticeable that the prophet does not address the king. It may be that he trusted him, but not his ministers. We have to remember that the rulers (better, <span class= "ital">judges; </span>same word as <span class= "ital">kadi</span>) thus addressed were probably those who were outwardly active in Hezekiah's work of reformation, or had taken part in the older routine worship under Uzziah. For princes and people alike that reformation was but superficial. The priestly writer of the Book of Chronicles might dwell only on the apparent good in either reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-2.htm" title="And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: however, he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.">2Chronicles 27:2</a>; 2 Chronicles 29-31); but the eye of Isaiah saw below the surface. In "the word of the Lord," and "the law of our God," we have two different aspects of the revelation of the Divine will, the first being the prophetic message of the prophet, the second pointing primarily, perhaps, to the law given by Moses, but including also, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm" title="The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.">Psalm 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-1.htm" title="Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.">Psalm 119:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm" title="He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.">Isaiah 42:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm" title="Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law.">Isaiah 42:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-7.htm" title="Listen to me, you that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear you not the reproach of men, neither be you afraid of their revilings.">Isaiah 51:7</a>, all forms of direct ethical teaching, especially, perhaps, such as were actually based upon the law or <span class= "ital">Torah </span>as a text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-15.</span> - THE PEOPLE'S PLEA NO EXCUSE, BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THEIR GUILT. The prophet supposes the people, by the mouth of their rulers, to meet the charge of rebellion with an appeal to the fact that they maintain all the outward ordinances of religion, as required by the Lawn and are therefore blameless. This draws from him a burst of indignant eloquence, which the Holy Spirit directs him to put, mainly, into the mouth of God (vers. 11-15), denouncing such a pretence of religion as an aggravation of their sin, and characterizing their whole worship as an "abomination." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear the word of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Do not <span class="accented">speak to</span> no purpose, but hear." The rulers are supposed to have begun their plea, but the prophet stops them. <span class="cmt_word">Ye rulers of Sodom.</span> Having said in the preceding verse how nearly Jerusalem had suffered the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, the writer grows more bold, and proceeds to give Jerusalem the obnoxious names. Her "rulers, "literally, <span class="accented">judges</span> (<span class="accented">katsin</span> in Hebrew corresponding to <span class="accented">kadi</span> in Arabic), are "rulers of Sodom;" her people are the "people of Gomorrah." There is as much wickedness, though it may be not the same wickedness, in "the daughter of Zion" at the existing time, as in the cities of the plain when God destroyed them. <span class="cmt_word">The law of our God.</span> Not the Levitical Law, though the word used has generally that sense, but the "instruction" or "direction" that was about to be uttered (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>; and see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a> and Isaiah 51:4). See Mr. Cheyne's note on the passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Judea was desolate, and their cities burned. This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.</body></html>
