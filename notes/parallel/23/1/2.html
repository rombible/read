The words remind us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-19.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>, but the thought was the common inheritance of Hebrew poets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-4.htm" title="He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.">Psalm 50:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm" title="O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 22:29</a>), and we can draw no inference from the parallelism as to the date of either book.<p><span class= "bld">I have nourished and brought up children. </span>The last word has in the Hebrew the emphasis of position: <span class= "ital">Sons I have reared and brought up. </span>From those who had thus grown up under a father's care filial duty might have been expected; but it was not so. The sons had rebelled against their father's control. It is significant that the prophet starts from the thought of the fatherhood of God in His relation to Israel. The people might be unworthy of their election, but He had chosen them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - GOD'S COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS PEOPLE. The groundwork of Isaiah's entire prophecy is Judah's defection from God. God's people have sinned, done amiss, dealt wickedly. The hour of vengeance approaches. Punishment has begun, and will go on, continually increasing in severity. National repentance would avert God's judgments, but the nation will not repeat. God's vengeance will fall, and by it a remnant will be purified, and return to God, and be his true people. In the present section the indictment is laid. Judah's sins are called to her remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth</span>. "A grave and magnificent exorilium! All nature is invoked to hear Jehovah make complaint of the ingratitude of his people" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The invocation is cast in the same form with that so common in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1), and seems to indicate familiarity with that book. The idea extends widely among sacred and other poets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1, 2</a>; Aesch., 'P. V.,' 11. 88-92). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath spoken</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord</span> (literally, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented">speaketh</span> (so Lowth, Cheyne, and Gesenius). The speech of Jehovah follows in vers. 2, 3. <span class="cmt_word">I have nourished and brought up children</span>; literally, (<span class="accented">my</span>) <span class="accented">sons I have made great and high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have raised Israel to greatness and exalted him among the nations. Notwithstanding their disobedience, God still acknowledges them as his "sons." <span class="cmt_word">They have rebelled against me.</span> The verb used is generally rendered in our version "transgressed" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>); but it may also have the stronger sense here assigned it. Lowth translates, "revolted from me;" Gesenius, "fallen away from me;" Cheyne, "broken away from me." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, The salvation of the Lord; a very suitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus the Saviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.</body></html>
