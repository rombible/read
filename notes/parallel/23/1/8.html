The second similitude is of the same character. Cucumbers and other plants of the gourd type (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-6.htm" title="And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief.

Rhetorically, however, it forms a climax. The city was not at this time actually besieged, but it was so hemmed in with perils, so isolated from all help, that this was what its condition practically came to. It was neither more nor less than "as a besieged city," or 'within a measurable distance' of becoming so.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The daughter of Zion.</span> Not "the faithful Church" (Kay), but the city of Jerusalem, which is thus personified.

Vineyards required to be watched for a few weeks only as the fruit began to ripen; and the watchers, or keepers, built themselves, therefore, mere "booths" for their protection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>). These were frail, solitary dwellings - very forlorn, very helpless. Such was now Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers.</span> Cucumber-gardens required watching throughout the season, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from spring to autumn, and their watcher needed a more solid edifice than a booth. Hence such gardens had "lodges" in them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> permanent huts or sheds, such as those still seen in Palestine (Tristram's 'Natural History of Palestine,' p. 442). <span class="cmt_word">As a besieged city.</span> Though not yet besieged, Jerusalem is as if besieged - isolated, surrounded by waste tracts, threatened. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, The salvation of the Lord; a very suitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus the Saviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.</body></html>
