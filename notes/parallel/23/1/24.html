It is foreknown to God that Israel will not repent. He therefore fulminates his judgment; which, however, is still conditional, so far as individuals are con-corned. His vengeance will fall upon the land; but the result will be twofold. Destruction will come upon the unrighteous and the sinners (ver. 28) - they will be "consumed" (ver. 28), and "confounded" (ver. 29); but there will be some on whom the punishment will have a purifying power, whose dross it will purge away, and whom it will convert to God (vers. 25, 27). From these will rise up a new Jerusalem - a "city of righteousness," a "faithful stronghold" (ver. 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord, the Lord of hosts</span>. In the original, <span class="accented">Ha-Adon</span>, <span class="accented">Jehovah Sabaoth - i.e.</span> "The Lord" (or "Master" of men and angels), "the Self-Existing One of the hosts of heaven" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, their God, the only proper object of their worship. It gives peculiar weight and significance to this prophecy, that it is introduced by a triple designation of the Divine Being. <span class="cmt_word">The Mighty One of Israel.</span> A very unusual designation, only found here and, with the modification of "Jacob" for "Israel, "in the following places: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2, 5</a>.

Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?</body></html>
