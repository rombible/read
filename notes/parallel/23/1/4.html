(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-20.htm" title="You shall not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land, and slain your people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.">Isaiah 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-23.htm" title="They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.">Isaiah 65:23</a>.) The word "children" (better, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>, <span class= "ital">sons</span>) once more emphasises the guilt of those who ought to have been obedient.<p><span class= "bld">They have forsaken the Lord </span>. . .--The three verbs paint the several stages of the growth in evil. Men first forsake, then spurn, then openly apostatise. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm" title="No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Luke 16:13</a>). In the "Holy One of Israel" we have the Divine name on which Isaiah most delights to dwell, and which had been impressed on his mind by the <span class= "ital">Trisagion</span>, which accompanied his first call to the office of a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The thought expressed by the name is that all ideas of consecration, purity, and holiness are gathered up in God. The term occurs fourteen times in the first part of Isaiah, and sixteen times in the second. A corrupt people needed to be reminded ever more and more of the truth which the name asserted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah sinful nation.</span> These are the words of Isaiah, not of Jehovah. The prophet, having delivered God's message in vers. 2 and 3, proceeds to impress and enforce it on the people by remarks of his own. He begins with a lamentation over their wickedness and impenitence; "Ah sinful nation!" or "Alas for the sinful nation! "the nation called to be holy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, etc.), but sunk in sin and wickedness. How sad their condition! How almost hopeless! <span class="cmt_word">Laden with iniquity</span>; literally, <span class="accented">heavy with guilt</span>. But our version well expresses the sense. As the psalmist says, "My sins have gone up over my head, and are like a sore burden, toe heavy for me to bear" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A seed of evil-doers.</span> Not descendants of evil-doors, but "an evil-doing seed, "or "race" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-9.htm">Isaiah 61:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Children that are corrupters</span>; literally, <span class="accented">sons that do corruptly</span>. It is not their corrupting of others, though that might follow, but the corruption that was in themselves, which is spoken cf. The corruption was both moral and doctrinal (see ver. 21). In corroboration of the fact, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They have forsaken</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord.</span> Not by renouncing his worship, which they still continued (see vers. 11-15), but by reducing it to a formality. The people "honored him with their lips, while their hearts were far from him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have provoked to anger</span>; rather, <span class="accented">despised</span> (Revised Version), or <span class="accented">scorched</span> (Kay, Cheyne), or <span class="accented">rejected with disdain</span> (Lowth), in allusion to their disobeying his commandments (see vers. 21-23). <span class="cmt_word">The Holy One of Israel.</span> This title of God is a favorite one with Isaiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-7.htm">Isaiah 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11, 12, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-14.htm">Isaiah 41:14, 16, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-9.htm">Isaiah 60:9, 14</a>), and is very rarely used by the other sacred writers. We find it thrice in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-22.htm">Psalm 71:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>); once in Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a>), but then in the mouth of Isaiah; twice in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:29; 51:5); and once in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>). According to Isaiah's conception of God, holiness is the most essential element of his nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3, 5, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They are gone away backward</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they are estranged backwards</span>; or, as Bishop Lowth paraphrases, "they are estranged from him; they have turned their back upon him." Instead of looking to God, and following after him, they "followed a multitude to do evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, The salvation of the Lord; a very suitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus the Saviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.</body></html>
