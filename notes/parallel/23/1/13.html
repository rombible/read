The prophet brings together all the chief ritual phrases without an elaborate attention to the details connected with them.<p><span class= "bld">The new moons and sabbaths </span>. . .--The classification agrees with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-13.htm" title="Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.">2Chronicles 8:13</a> : sabbaths, new moons, and solemn feasts." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-11.htm" title="I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.">Hosea 2:11</a>). The term "convocation," or "assembly," was specially applied to the Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-7.htm" title="In the first day you shall have an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-21.htm" title="And you shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation to you: you shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.">Leviticus 23:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm" title="Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:27</a>). The religious revival under Hezekiah brought all these into a fresh prominence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-3.htm" title="He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.">2Chronicles 31:3</a>).

"Iniquity" was there. The character of a ruling caste is not changed in a day, and the lives of rulers and judges were under Hezekiah as they had been in the days of Ahaz, or at least in those of Uzziah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bring no more vain oblations.</span> The command is net "Bring no more oblations, "as though the daily oblation was to cease; but "bring no more oblations that are <span class="accented">vain</span> ones, "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> empty and unreal - mere forms, without the proper corresponding spirit. The "oblation" spoken of is the <span class="accented">minchah</span>, or "meat offering," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-12.htm">Numbers 28:12-31</a>, which was a cake of fine flour mingled with oil, and generally had incense joined with it, which explains the <span class="accented">nexus of</span> this clause with the following one. <span class="cmt_word">Incense is an abomination unto me.</span> God had commanded the use of incense in worship, as he had commanded burnt offerings and oblations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-8, 34-38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12, 13</a>). But incense symbolized prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>); and if no heartfelt prayer accompanied its use, it was emptied of all its significance, and became hateful to God - a <span class="accented">mere</span> form, and consequently an "abomination." <span class="cmt_word">The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with</span>. The weekly festival of the sabbath, the monthly one of the "new moon, "and the annual "assemblies" or "solemn feasts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>), were the main occasions of Jewish worship. As at this time conducted, God could endure none of them; all were tainted with the prevalent unreality. The construction of the passage is highly rhetorical, and indicates great excitement of feeling. Kay translates it literally, "New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, I cannot - it is ungodliness - even the solemn meeting." The authors of the Revised Version also suppose an aposiopesis. <span class="cmt_word">The solemn meeting.</span> The word thus translated is applied only to particular days in the great festival seasons, as to the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>), and the seventh day of the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a>), or else to days specially appointed for religious services by civil authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-9.htm">2 Chronicles 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>). The meaning thus is, that <span class="accented">even the very highest</span> 'occasions of religious worship were abused by the Israelites of the time, and made an offence to God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Judea was desolate, and their cities burned. This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.</body></html>
