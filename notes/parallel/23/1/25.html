The imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm" title="Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:">Isaiah 1:22</a> is resumed. The great Refiner can purify the debased metal. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-2.htm" title="But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, we have the same image expanded. The process involved, of course, the rejection of the dross--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the interpretation of the parable, of the lead that <span class= "ital">would </span>not let itself be turned to silver.<p><span class= "bld">Tin.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">lead. </span>In either case Isaiah's knowledge of metallurgy was probably due to intercourse with the Ph?nicians, who brought both lead and tin from Tarshish (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Spain).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will turn my hand upon thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will bring back my hand upon thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will once more put forth the "strong hand and mighty arm, with which I brought thee out of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a>), and will work another deliverance - the deliverance of Israel out of captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Purely purge away thy dross</span>; literally, <span class="accented">will purge away thy dross like borax</span>, which was used as a flux in purifying the metal.

Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour of wine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help the oppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; but only God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spirit of Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. The redemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death of Christ, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is here meant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree when blasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hot countries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust in idols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; not only soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. When the sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himself as a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?</body></html>
