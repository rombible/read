(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11-13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">When ye make many prayers.</span>--The Pentateuch contains no directions for the use of forms of prayer beyond the benediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/6-23.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,">Numbers 6:23-26</a>, and two forms connected with the Passover in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/26-13.htm" title="Then you shall say before the LORD your God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandments which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.">Deuteronomy 26:13-15</a>. The "eighteen prayers" for daily use belong to the later Rabbinic stage of Judaism. It lies in the nature of the case, however, that first a real, and then an ostentatious devotion would show itself in the use of such forms, possibly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-164.htm" title="Seven times a day do I praise you because of your righteous judgments.">Psalm 119:164</a>, "seven times a day." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-14.htm" title="He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.">Proverbs 27:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm" title="He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.">Proverbs 28:9</a>, which belong to the reign of Hezekiah, and may, therefore, indirectly represent Isaiah's teaching, we have the warnings of the wise as to the right use of such forms.<p><span class= "bld">Your hands are full of blood.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">bloods, </span>as implying many murderous acts. The words point to the guilt of judges and princes, such as that described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-2.htm" title="By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood touches blood.">Hosea 4:2</a>. Life was sacrificed to greed of gain, or lust, or vindictiveness. To the prophet's eye those hands, stretched upwards in the Temple by some, at least, of the king's ministers and judges, were red with the blood of the slain. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm" title="For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perverseness.">Isaiah 59:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will hide mine eyes,</span> etc. A time comes when the wicked are alarmed, and seek to turn to God; but it is <span class="accented">too late</span>. "Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When ye make many prayers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">multiply prayer</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Full of blood</span> (comp. ver. 21). Actual bloodshed may be pointed at, as the murder of Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-21.htm">2 Chronicles 24:21</a>), and the fate which befell Isaiah himself, according to the tradition, would seem to show. But cruelty and oppression, producing poverty and wretchedness, and tending to shorten life, are no doubt also included (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10, 11</a>). These were the special sins of the time (see vers. 17, 23). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Judea was desolate, and their cities burned. This awakened them to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God to remove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Many who will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded to part with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a service deserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, without thorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. He not only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows that sin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, or forbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our very prayers will become abomination.</body></html>
