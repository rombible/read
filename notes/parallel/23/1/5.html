The description that follows is one of the natural parables of ethics, and reminds us of Plato's description of the souls of tyrants as being full of ulcerous sores (<span class= "ital">Gorg., </span>c. 80). The description may have connected itself with the prophet's personal experience or training in the medicine and surgery of his time, or with the diseases which came as judgments on Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-18.htm" title="And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.">2Chronicles 21:18</a>) and Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm" title="And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.">2Chronicles 26:20</a>). We find him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-21.htm" title="For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster on the boil, and he shall recover.">Isaiah 38:21</a> prescribing for Hezekiah's boil. It would seem, indeed, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm" title="And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.">2Chronicles 16:12</a>, that the prophets, as an order, practised the art of healing, and so were rivals of the "physicians," who depended chiefly on idolatrous charms and incantations. The picture of the disease reminds us of the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/28-22.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.">Deuteronomy 28:22-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm" title="So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.">Job 2:7</a>, and of the descriptions of like pestilences in the history of Florence, and of England. Every part of the body is tainted by the poison. "We note a certain technical precision in the three terms used: "wounds" (literally, <span class= "ital">cuts, </span>as inflicted by a sword or knife); "bruises," or <span class= "ital">weals, </span>marks of the scourge or rod; "putrifying sores," wounds that have festered into ulcers. As the diagnosis is technical, so also are the therapeutic agencies. To "close" or "press" the festering wound was the process tried at first to get rid of the purulent discharge; then, as in Hezekiah's case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-21.htm" title="For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster on the boil, and he shall recover.">Isaiah 38:21</a>), it was "bound up," with a poultice, then some stimulating oil or unguent, probably, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-34.htm" title="And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.">Luke 10:34</a>, oil and wine were used, to cleanse the ulcer. No such remedies, the prophet says, had been applied to the spiritual disease of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why should ye</span>, etc.? Translate, <span class="accented">Why will ye be still smitten</span>, <span class="accented">revolting more and more?</span> or, <span class="accented">Why will ye persist in re-hellion</span>, <span class="accented">and so be smitten yet more?</span> The Authorized Version does not express the sense, which is that suffering <span class="accented">must</span> follow sin - that if they still revolt, they must still be smitten for it - why, then, will they do so? Compare Ezekiel's "Why will ye die, O house of Israel?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The whole head... the whole heart.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, "Every head... <span class="accented">every</span> heart;" but Lowth, Gesenius, and Ewald agree with the Authorized Version. The prophet personifies Israel, and means to say that the <span class="accented">whole</span> head of the nation is diseased, its <span class="accented">whole</span> heart faint, or "prostrate with languor" (Kay). The head and heart represent respectively the intellectual and moral natures. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, The salvation of the Lord; a very suitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus the Saviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know or consider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly care and kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls! Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, as ignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here is a comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemper threatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head; from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness, no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul. Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. This passage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remains unrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventing fatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts or sheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen in the East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of the people. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants at Jerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. The evil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifying Spirit can restore us to spiritual health.</body></html>
