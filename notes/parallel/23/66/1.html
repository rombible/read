Was he anticipating the vision of the Apocalypse, that in the new Jerusalem there was to be "no temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22</a>)? Neither of these views is satisfactory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a>, and the writings of Ezekiel, Haggai, Zechariah, all pre-supposing the existence of a new temple. It seems better to see in the words the utterance, in its strongest form, of the truth that God dwelleth, not in temples made with hands, that utterance being compatible, as in the case of Solomon himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-18.htm" title="But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!">2Chronicles 6:18</a>), of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/2-16.htm" title="And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.">John 2:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-23</a>), of St. Stephen, who quoted this passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48-50</a>), with the profoundest reverence for the visible sanctuary. Cheyne quotes a striking parallel from an Egyptian hymn to the Nile of the fourteenth century B.C., in which we find the writer saying of God, <span class= "ital">"</span>His abode is not known <span class= "bld">. . .</span> there is no building that can contain Him." (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iv.</span> 109.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - THE UNGODLY EXILES REBUKED. Israel, being about to return from the Captivity, had the design of rebuilding the temple and re-establishing the temple worship. God rebukes this design in persons devoid of any spirit of holiness, and warns them that mere formal outward worship is an abomination to him (vers. 1-3). In ver. 4 he threatens them with punishment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>). The Hebrews, while they earnestly desired to have a material emblem of the presence of God in their midst, were deeply impressed with the feeling that no temple could be worthy of him, or other than most unworthy. "Will God," said Solomon, "indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heavens of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). And again, "Who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before trim?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>). Thus Isaiah's note of warning was no novelty, and might rind responsive echoes in the hearts of many. <span class="cmt_word">Where is the house that ye build unto me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">what manner of house is it that ye would build to me</span>, <span class="accented">add what manner of place for my rest</span>? God needs no "house;" and they cannot build him a house that could be in any way worthy of him. <span class="accented">They</span>, moreover, are unworthy to build him any house, which is the real ground of the refusal. There was no refusal, when the better part of the exiles, having returned, took the building in hand (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-8.htm">Haggai 1:8-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>66:1-4 The Jews gloried much in their temple. But what satisfaction can the Eternal Mind take in a house made with men's hands? God has a heaven and an earth of his own making, and temples of man's making; but he overlooks them, that he may look with favour to him who is poor in spirit and serious, self-abasing and self-denying; whose heart truly sorrows for sin: such a heart is a living temple for God. The sacrifice of the wicked is not only unacceptable, but a great offence to God. And he that now offers a sacrifice after the law, does in effect set aside Christ's sacrifice. He that burns incense, puts contempt upon the incense of Christ's intercession, and is as if he blessed an idol. Men shall be deceived by the vain confidences with which they deceive themselves. Unbelieving hearts, and unpurified consciences, need no more to make them miserable, than to have their own fears brought upon them. Whatever men put in the place of the priesthood, atonement, and intercession of Christ, will be found hateful to God.</body></html>
