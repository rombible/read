<span class= "ital">I will punish </span>or <span class= "ital">I have seen </span>by others. The thought, in any case, is that the eye of Jehovah sees the evil things that are done in the secret places, caves or groves, in which the heathen rites were celebrated.<p><span class= "bld">All nations and tongues . . .</span>--The phrase, though not incompatible with Isaiah's authorship, is specially characteristic of the prophets of the Exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-4.htm" title="Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,">Daniel 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-7.htm" title="Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.">Daniel 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm" title="Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.">Daniel 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-1.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-23.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.">Zechariah 8:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">They shall come, and see my glory.</span>--The "glory" in the prophet's thoughts is that of Jehovah manifested in His righteous judgments on open enemies and concealed apostates.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I know their works</span>. There is no verb in the Hebrew text, from which something has evidently fallen out. Mr. Cheyne supplies, "I will punish;" Gratz, "I have seen."
