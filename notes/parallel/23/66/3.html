Chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/65-3.htm" title="A people that provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and burns incense on altars of brick;">Isaiah 65:3-11</a> had pointed to tendencies, not yet extinct, which led to open apostasy. Now the prophet declares that there may be as real an apostasy beneath an orthodox creed and an irreproachable ritual. Each act of the hypocrite's worship is as an idolatrous abomination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">is a manslayer.</span> The full meaning seems to be, "He that, not being of a poor and contrite spirit, would offer me an ox in sacrifice, is as little pleasing to me as a murderer." Sacrifice, without the true spirit of sacrifice, is an abomination (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord," etc.). There, however, the sacrifices are actually offered; here they are hypothetical. The ungodly exiles design to offer sacrifice to God in his temple, when they have rebuilt it (ver. 1). God rejects their offerings by anticipation. <span class="cmt_word">As if he out off a dog's neck</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> would no more please me by the sacrifice than if he were to make an offering of the unclean dog." (On the uncleanness of the dog, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He that offereth an oblation</span>; or, a meat <span class="accented">offering</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He that burneth incense</span>. With his meat offering, as directed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 2</a>. Such a one is no better than he that blesseth (i.e. worships) an idol. It may be suspected that the ritual acts selected for comparison with those of the Levitical law are practices to which the exiles were given (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have chosen</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">as they haw chosen.</span> The clause stands over against the first clause of ver. 4, "As they (<span class="accented">gain hemmah</span>) have chosen their ways, so I (<span class="accented">gain ani</span>) have chosen their delusions." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>66:1-4 The Jews gloried much in their temple. But what satisfaction can the Eternal Mind take in a house made with men's hands? God has a heaven and an earth of his own making, and temples of man's making; but he overlooks them, that he may look with favour to him who is poor in spirit and serious, self-abasing and self-denying; whose heart truly sorrows for sin: such a heart is a living temple for God. The sacrifice of the wicked is not only unacceptable, but a great offence to God. And he that now offers a sacrifice after the law, does in effect set aside Christ's sacrifice. He that burns incense, puts contempt upon the incense of Christ's intercession, and is as if he blessed an idol. Men shall be deceived by the vain confidences with which they deceive themselves. Unbelieving hearts, and unpurified consciences, need no more to make them miserable, than to have their own fears brought upon them. Whatever men put in the place of the priesthood, atonement, and intercession of Christ, will be found hateful to God.</body></html>
