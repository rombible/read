The outward figure is now presented as in an inverted form, to express a new spiritual fact. The children of Zion will find a maternal tenderness and care at the hands of the heathen nations, who are to be as their "nursing mothers." (Comp. 60:16.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will extend peace to her like a river</span>; literally, I <span class="accented">will direct peace to her</span>, <span class="accented">like a river.</span> The waters of streams are in the East directed hither and thither by the agriculturist. God would have given his people "peace, as a river," long previously, had they permitted him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the glory of the Gentiles</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>, etc.). Like a flowing stream; literally, <span class="accented">as an overflowing torrent.</span> There is perhaps a contrast intended between the former and the latter times. In the former times Assyria had swept over Israel like an overwhelming flood to destroy her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7, 8</a>); now the glory of the whole Gentile world should similarly overflow and overwhelm, but only to enrich and exalt. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall be borne upon her</span> <span class="cmt_word">sides</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 9:4). It is Jerusalem, and not the Gentile world (Delitzsch, Cheyne), that will thus care for and caress her children. The continuance of the metaphor from ver. 11 is marked by the repetition of the verb, "ye shall suck." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>66:5-14 The prophet turns to those that trembled at God's word, to comfort and encourage them. The Lord will appear, to the joy of the humble believer, and to the confusion of hypocrites and persecutors. When the Spirit was poured out, and the gospel went forth from Zion, multitudes were converted in a little time. The word of God, especially his promises, and ordinances, are the consolations of the church. The true happiness of all Christians is increased by every convert brought to Christ. The gospel brings with it, wherever it is received in its power, such a river of peace, as will carry us to the ocean of boundless and endless bliss. Divine comforts reach the inward man; the joy of the Lord will be the strength of the believer. Both God's mercy and justice shall be manifested, and for ever magnified.</body></html>
