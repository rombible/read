and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>). The underlying thought is that the returning exiles would be the most acceptable offering that could be brought to Jehovah. The same idea appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a>, and a similar one, transferred, however, to the Gentile converts, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Upon horses, and in chariots . . .</span>--The list of the modes of transport, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-15.htm" title="And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.">Zechariah 14:15</a>, points to the various habits of the many nations who are to be sharers in the work.<p><span class= "bld">As the children of Israel . . .</span>--The "clean offering" is, as before, the <span class= "ital">minchah. </span>The heathen, or, perhaps, even the chariots and litters on which they brought the exiles, are as the "clean vessels" in which the <span class= "ital">minchah </span>was brought to the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall bring all</span> <span class="cmt_word">your brethren for an offering unto the Lord.</span> When the distant Gentiles have been converted, they shall bring to Christ the Jews of the dispersion, who dwell with them in the remote parts of the earth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm">Zephaniah 3:10</a>). Upon horses. The "new Jerusalem" being localized, the converts from the distant regions are represented as journeying from their own lands to the "holy mountain," and bringing the Jewish exiles with them by various methods of conveyance - upon horses, mules, and dromedaries, in chariots, and finally in palanquins or litters. "Litters" were used by the great men among the Egyptians from a very early date (see Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 93, fig. 2; Wilkinson, ' Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 2. p. 208). They were also employed by the Persians (Herod., 3:146) and by the later Romans. As the children of Israel bring an offering; rather, <span class="accented">bring the meat offering.</span> The existence of the temple, and the continuance of the Levitical rites at the time of the delivery of this prophecy, are clearly implied. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>66:19,20, set forth the abundance of means for conversion of sinners. These expressions are figurative, and express the plentiful and gracious helps for bringing God's elect home to Christ. All shall be welcome; and nothing shall be wanting for their assistance and encouragement. A gospel ministry shall be set up in the church; they would have solemn worship before the Lord. In the last verse the nature of the punishment of sinners in the world to come is represented. Then shall the righteous and wicked be separated. Our Saviour applies this to the everlasting misery and torment of impenitent sinners in the future state. To the honour of that free grace which thus distinguishes them, let the redeemed of the Lord, with humility, and not without holy trembling, sing triumphant songs. With this affecting representation of the opposite states of the righteous and wicked, characters which include the whole human race, Isaiah concludes his prophecies. May God grant, for Christ's sake, that our portion may be with those who fear and love his name, who cleave to his truths, and persevere in every good work, looking to receive from the Lord Jesus Christ the gracious invitation, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</body></html>
