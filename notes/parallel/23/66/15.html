A signal outpouring of God's vengeance upon his enemies precedes the settlement of the Church in its final glorious condition, both in Isaiah and in the Revelation of St. John (see ch. 34, 35, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19-21</a>.). The wicked have to be removed before the righteous can be established in peace. Here the agencies employed against the wicked are "fire" and "sword" - fire pointing (as Delitzsch remarks) to destructive occurrences of nature, and the sword to destructive occurrences of history. God himself is represented as guiding and directing both agencies, to the punishment of the ungodly and the relief of those who trust in him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Lord will come with</span> <span class="cmt_word">fire.</span> "Fire" is a usual accompaniment of a "theophany." God descended on Sinai "in fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), and led the Israelites through the wilderness by the pillar of the cloud and of fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>), and filled the tabernacle with a glory as of fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>), and "answered David from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>), and in the same way answered Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>) and Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). Isaiah almost always describes a theophany as a "coming with fire" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12, 14</a>, etc.). The agency of fire in the judgment that will overtake the wicked simultaneously with Christ's second coming, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7-10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With his</span> <span class="cmt_word">chariots</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>). "Chariots," in the plural, may be regarded as symbolizing the "hosts" of natural and supernatural forces that God has at his command (Cheyne). Like a whirlwind. The whirring of the wheels of chariots, their noise, the swiftness of their pace, and the destruction that they cause, make this simile most appropriate.
