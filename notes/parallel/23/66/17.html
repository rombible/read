The "consecration" and "purification" are the initiatory rites of heathen mysteries, connected probably with the worship of Baal or Ashtoreth, or, as the context, with its reference to gardens and swine's flesh, renders probable, with that of Thammuz. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm" title="For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.">Isaiah 64:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Behind one tree in the midst.</span>--The noun "tree" is a conjectural explanation. The Hebrew text <span class= "ital">gives </span>the "one" in the masculine, and is explained as referring either (1) to the Hierophant, who led the worshippers; or (2), as with a contemptuous reluctance to utter the name of the false deity, to Thammuz. The Hebrew margin gives "one" in the feminine, and this may have been meant for the <span class= "ital">Asherah, </span>the "grove," or Phallic symbol of idolatrous worship. If we adopt the masculine, and refer it to Thammuz, the word may connect itself with the lamentations of the Syrian maidens over Thammuz (Adonis) as over an only son. (Comp. Milton, <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>i.)<p><span class= "bld">The abomination.</span>--The word stands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-21.htm" title="Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-11.htm" title="They shall be even an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination.">Leviticus 11:11</a>, for various kinds of unclean beasts, among which the mouse, or jerboa, still eaten by the Arabs, was conspicuous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-29.htm" title="These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,">Leviticus 11:29</a>). It is probable that all these, as well as the swine's flesh, were used in the idolfeasts. In any case the apostate worshippers would seem to have exulted in throwing off the restraints of the Mosaic law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that sanctify... themselves</span> in the gardens (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>; and see the comment on the latter passage). Behind one tree in the midst; literally, <span class="accented">behind one in the midst.</span> It seems quite impossible that "one" can mean "one tree," when no tree has been mentioned, and gardens do not necessarily contain trees. The marginal rendering, "one after another," is also impossible. The "one in the midst" must have been either a hierophant who directed the ceremonies (Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Delitzsch), or an image of a deity (Scaliger, Voss, Grotius, Lagarde, Cheyne). In the latter case, we must suppose that the worshippers had a scruple about mentioning the deity's name, and were accustomed to call him "one," or "a certain one" (comp. Herod., 2:171). Isaiah adopts their usage. <span class="cmt_word">Eating swine's</span> <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>). And the abomination. The word is used generically of all the "abominable things" forbidden to be eaten in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4-30</a>, as the camel, the coney, the hare, the eagle, the vulture, the ferret, the chameleon, the lizard, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The mouse</span>. Probably the jerboa (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/66.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>66:15-24 A prophetic declaration is given of the Lord's vengeance on all enemies of his church, especially that of all antichristian opposers of the gospel in the latter days.
