(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a>.) Through the long years of exile He had seemed to hide Himself, to be negligent of His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm" title="And I will wait on the LORD, that hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm" title="In a little wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, said the LORD your Redeemer.">Isaiah 54:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-1.htm" title="Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not yourself from my supplication.">Psalm 55:1</a>) or unable to help them. Now it would be seen that He had all along been as the Strong one (<span class= "ital">El</span>) working for their deliverance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself</span>. Some commentators regard this as an exclamation made by Isaiah himself, who marvels at the unsearchable mystery of God's ways. But others, with better reason, take it for a continuation of the speech of the converted heathen, who marvel that God has so long hid himself from them and from the world at large, not manifesting his power, as he has now done in the person of Cyrus. In this recent manifestation he has shown himself especially the <span class="cmt_word">God of Israel, and their Saviour</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:11-19 Believers may ask in prayer for what they need; if for their good, it will not be withheld. But how common to hear God called to account for his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returning Jews. Those redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restoration would convince many, and convert some; and all that truly join the Lord, find his service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let them wait upon the Lord who hides his face. There is a world without end; and it will be well or ill with us, according as it shall be with us in that world. The Lord we serve and trust, is God alone. All that God has said is plain, satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us to seek him, so he never denied believing prayers, nor disappointed believing expectations. He gives grace sufficient, and comfort and satisfaction of soul.</body></html>
