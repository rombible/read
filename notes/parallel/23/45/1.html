It has to be remembered that the words had not yet received the special application given to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm" title="And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.">Daniel 9:26</a>, and had been used of the theocratic kings, of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-9.htm" title="And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?">1Samuel 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-11.htm" title="The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray you, take you now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.">1Samuel 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-16.htm" title="This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.">1Samuel 26:16</a>), of the house of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-51.htm" title="He is the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever more.">2Samuel 22:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm" title="Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,">2Samuel 23:1</a>), and of the patriarch Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a>). What is meant, therefore, is that Cyrus, the future deliverer, would be as truly a king "by the grace of God" as David had been, not only, like Nebuchadnezzar, "a servant of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm" title="And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-10.htm" title="And say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.">Jeremiah 43:10</a>), but "fulfilling all his pleasure," whom He <span class= "ital">grasps </span>by the right hand and guides.<p><span class= "bld">I will loose the loins.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I will ungird, </span>either as a general symbol of weakening, or specifically for disarming, the sword being suspended from the girdle. The "two-leaved gates" are those of kingly palaces; the <span class= "ital">"</span>gates," those of cities, which will have to open to him. The words here, and in the next verse, may have been used with a special reference to the "hundred brazen gates" of Babylon (Herod. i. 179).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - GOD'S WILL CONCERNING HIM ANNOUNCED TO CYRUS. This direct address of God to a heathen king is without a parallel in Scripture. Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Abimelech, were warned through dreams. Nebuchadnezzar was even promised Divine aid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24, 25</a>). But no heathen monarch had previously been personally addressed by God, much less called "his anointed," and spoken to <span class="accented">by his name</span> (ver. 4). Three motives are mentioned for this special favour to him: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he might acknowledge Jehovah to be the true God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Israel might be benefited and advantaged by him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the attention of the whole world might be attracted, and the unity of God made manifest far and wide (vers. 3-6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord to his anointed</span>. The "anointed of Jehovah" is elsewhere always either an Israelite king, or the expected Deliverer of the nation, "Messiah the Prince" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>). This Deliverer, however, was to be of the line of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), and of the city of Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), so that we can scarcely suppose Isaiah to have seen him in Cyrus. But he may have seen in Cyrus a type of the great Deliverer, as he saw in the release of Israel from the power of Babylon a type of their deliverance from sin. <span class="cmt_word">Whose right hand I have holden</span>; rather, <span class="accented">strengthened</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To subdue nations before him</span> (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). Among the nations subdued by Cyrus may be mentioned the Medes, the Babylonians, the Lydians, the Caftans, the Caunians, the Lycians, the Bactrians, the Sacae, the Parthians, the Hyrcanians, the Chorasmians, the Sogdians, the Arians of Herat, the Zarangians, the Arachosians, the Satagydians, and the Gandarians. <span class="cmt_word">I will loose the loins of kings</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. render them weak and incapable of resistance" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>), net "disarm them" (Cheyne); for the chief royal weapons were the spear and the bow, neither of which was carried at the girdle. To open before him the two-leaved gates. The cities and forts repro-sented on the Assyrian monuments have invariably their gateways closed by two large gates or doors which meet in the centre of the gateway. The bronze plating found at Ballarat gave the dimensions, and showed the strength of such gates ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archseol.,' vol. 7. pp. 83-88). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-4 Cyrus is called God's anointed; he was designed and qualified for his great service by the counsel of God. The gates of Babylon which led to the river, were left open the night that Cyrus marched his army into the empty channel. The Lord went before him, giving entrance to the cities he besieged. He gave him also treasures, which had been hidden in secret places. The true God was to Cyrus an unknown God; yet God foreknew him; he called him by his name. The exact fulfilment of this must have shown Cyrus that Jehovah was the only true God, and that it was for the sake of Israel that he was prospered. In all the changes of states and kingdoms, God works out the good of his church.</body></html>
