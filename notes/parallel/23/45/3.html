Of the treasures which fell into the hands of Cyrus, the greatest were probably those of Babylon (Herod., 1:183) and of Sardis (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:2, &sect; 11). The value of the latter has been estimated at above one hundred and twenty-six millions sterling. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest know</span>; or, <span class="accented">acknowledge</span> (for the actual acknowledgment, see the decrees in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a> and Ezra 6:3-5). If these documents are accepted as genuine, or even as true in substance (Ewald), Cyrus must be considered to have identified Jehovah with his own Ormuzd, and to have viewed the Jewish and Persian religions as substantially the same. He would be under no temptation, with so weak and down-trodden a people as the Jews, to resort to politic pretences, as he might be in the case of the Babylonians (see the comment on Isaiah 41:25). <span class="cmt_word">Which call thee by thy name</span> (comp. ver. 1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>).

The gates of Babylon which led to the river, were left open the night that Cyrus marched his army into the empty channel. The Lord went before him, giving entrance to the cities he besieged. He gave him also treasures, which had been hidden in secret places. The true God was to Cyrus an unknown God; yet God foreknew him; he called him by his name. The exact fulfilment of this must have shown Cyrus that Jehovah was the only true God, and that it was for the sake of Israel that he was prospered. In all the changes of states and kingdoms, God works out the good of his church.</body></html>
