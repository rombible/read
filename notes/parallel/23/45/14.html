In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm" title="For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior: I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.">Isaiah 43:3</a>, Egypt, Ethiopia, Seba, had been given to Cyrus, as a reward, or ransom, for the deliverance of Israel. Here the prophet goes a step farther, and contemplates them as coming, in the spirit of a voluntary surrender, as proselytes to the faith of Israel, in self-imposed bondage, offering to Israel, as one with God, the "supplication" which, elsewhere, is offered to Jehovah. The promise reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm" title="Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.">Psalm 68:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm" title="The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.">Psalm 72:10</a>, and yet more of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-23.htm" title="In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.">Isaiah 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.">Isaiah 9:5-7</a>. A partial fulfilment may have been found in the command given by Cyrus, that these and other nations should assist in the work of rebuilding the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-4.htm" title="And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:4</a>). Egypt and Ethiopia send the products of their labour. The Sabaeans (<span class= "ital">sc. </span>the people of Meroe), strong, but not wealthy, come freely to offer their own labour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-25.</span> - THE CONVERSION' OF THE GENTILES A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESTORATION AND SALVATION OF ISRAEL. "With the prospect of the release of the exiles is associated," says Delitzsch, "in the prophet's perspective, the prospect of an expansion of the restored Church, through the entrance of the fulness of the Gentiles." Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saba are especially mentioned here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>, as among the first to come in (vers. 14, 15). Later on, a more general influx is spoken of (ver. 20); and, finally, a prospect is held out of an ultimate universal conversion (ver. 23). At the same time, judgment is denounced against the idolaters who persist in their idolatry (vers. 16, 20), and they are warned that they will have no share in the coming glories of the Israel of God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The labour of Egypt</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabaeans</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the laborious Egyptians, and the traffic-loving Ethiopians and Sabaeans." Their buildings and their husbandry alike justify what is said of the Egyptians, while the very ancient traffic between Egypt and Ethiopia is sufficient ground for the assignment of a commercial character to the Ethiopians and the Sabaeans. <span class="cmt_word">Men of stature</span>. (On the tall stature of the Ethiopians, see Herod., 3:20; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>, with the comment.) <span class="cmt_word">Shall come over unto thee</span>. Knobel understands that they would give their aid to the rebuilding of the temple; but this they certainly did not do, and Isaiah's words certainly do not imply it. He is again speaking of the great conversion of the nations, which he connected with the restoration of the Jews to their own land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18-25</a>, etc.), and which may be considered to have begun then, but only to have had its full accomplishment in the Messianic period. <span class="cmt_word">In chains they shall come over</span>. Ready to serve the Church as slaves and servants - not literally wearing chains. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fall down unto thee</span>, etc. The Church, as informed with the Spirit of God, shall Seem to them a holy thing, and therefore an object of worship (romp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>). There is such a union between Christ and his Church, that worship, in a qualified sense, may be paid the Church without unfitness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:11-19 Believers may ask in prayer for what they need; if for their good, it will not be withheld. But how common to hear God called to account for his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returning Jews. Those redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restoration would convince many, and convert some; and all that truly join the Lord, find his service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let them wait upon the Lord who hides his face. There is a world without end; and it will be well or ill with us, according as it shall be with us in that world. The Lord we serve and trust, is God alone. All that God has said is plain, satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us to seek him, so he never denied believing prayers, nor disappointed believing expectations. He gives grace sufficient, and comfort and satisfaction of soul.</body></html>
