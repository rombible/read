Dr. Kay and Mr. Cheyne understand the nations to be addressed, and told to "show" or "announce," and "bring forth" or "produce," any argument in favour of the divinity of their gods. But it is simpler and better, with our translators, to regard the address as made to the prophets of God, who are bidden to announce his message of mercy to the nations, and to bring them near to him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let them take counsel together</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let the nations consider one with another, whether God or the idols be the fitter object of worship. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath declared this?</span> "This" must refer to the conquest of Babylon and deliverance of Israel by Cyrus. None but Jehovah had ever announced this - none but he could bring it to pass<span class="cmt_word">. From ancient time</span>; rather, from <span class="accented">aforetime</span> (Cheyne). The announcement cannot have been made very long before this prophecy was delivered. <span class="cmt_word">A just God and a Saviour</span>. A God in whom "mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss each other" (Psalm 85:16); who can be at once just, "acting stringently according to the demands of his holiness" (Delitzsch), and yet design and effect the salvation of sinners. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:20-25 The nations are exhorted to draw near to Jehovah. None besides is able to help; he is the Saviour, who can save without the assistance of any, but without whom none can save. If the heart is brought into the obedience of Christ, the knee will cheerfully obey his commands. To Christ men shall come from every nation for blessings; all that hate his cause shall be put to shame, and all believers shall rejoice in him as their Friend and Portion. All must come to him: may we now come to him as the Lord our Righteousness, walking according to his commandments.</body></html>
