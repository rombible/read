Ultimately the words find their fulfilment in the conversion of the heathen to the true anointed of Jehovah, of whom Cyrus was a type. They will bear witness from their experience to the vanity of idols. They will learn that it does not avail to set up (or <span class= "ital">carry</span>) their idols in religious processions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-5.htm" title="They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.">Jeremiah 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm" title="So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.">1Samuel 4:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Assemble yourselves and come... ye... escaped of the nations</span>. The prophet reverts to the main idea of the section, which is the conversion of the Gentiles, and calls on all "the escaped of the nation" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who have survived the judgments of the time - to "assemble and come," to consider the claims of Jehovah to be the only true God, to "look to him (ver. 22) and be saved." The great judgments through which the heathen will be brought to God have been frequently mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11, 12, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13-15</a>, etc.). They must not be regarded as limited to the time of Cyrus, but rather as continuing into the Messianic period, and indeed nearly to its close (see especially ch. 34.). Each one of them constitutes a call to the nations, and is followed by a conversion to a greater or less extent. <span class="cmt_word">They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who lift up</span> (or, carry) <span class="accented">the wood of their graven image</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>, "They bear him upon the shoulder," where the same verb is used). It was a practice of the idolatrous heathen to carry the images of their gods in processions, generally exposed to view upon their shoulders (Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2. opp. p. 451), but sometimes partially concealed in shrines, or "arks" (Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 100, 101). There would be still among the "escaped" some who would so act. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:20-25 The nations are exhorted to draw near to Jehovah. None besides is able to help; he is the Saviour, who can save without the assistance of any, but without whom none can save. If the heart is brought into the obedience of Christ, the knee will cheerfully obey his commands. To Christ men shall come from every nation for blessings; all that hate his cause shall be put to shame, and all believers shall rejoice in him as their Friend and Portion. All must come to him: may we now come to him as the Lord our Righteousness, walking according to his commandments.</body></html>
