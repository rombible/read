God had been all along revealing Himself, not like the oracles of the heathen, in the gloom of caves and darkened shrines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm" title="Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;">Isaiah 65:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>), but in the broad daylight of history and in the law written on men's hearts. He had bidden men seek Him not in chaos, but in a world of order, and to recognise His utterances by their righteousness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in a place of the land of darkness.</span> Jehovah's oracles have not been given, like those of the necromancers, or those of the heathen gods, in dark places of the earth - caves like that of Trophonius (Pansan., 9:29, &sect; 2), or the inmost recesses (<span class="accented">adyta</span>) of temples; but openly on Sinai, or by the mouth of prophets who proclaimed his words to all Israel (romp. Dent. 30:11-14, "This commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off<span class="cmt_word">... </span> . But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it"). So our Lord says of his own teaching, "I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and <span class="accented">in secret have I said nothing"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). Seek ye me in vain; rather, <span class="accented">seek ye me as a chaos</span> (romp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>, where God says to his people, "Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness?"). God has no more revealed himself to his people as chaotic, confused, disordered, than he has presented the world to them in this condition.! the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. There is an allusion to the crooked and ambiguous utterances of the heathen oracles, which rarely gave direct answers or plainly expressed any definite meaning. God in his utterances never diverges from the straight line of righteousness and truth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:11-19 Believers may ask in prayer for what they need; if for their good, it will not be withheld. But how common to hear God called to account for his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returning Jews. Those redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restoration would convince many, and convert some; and all that truly join the Lord, find his service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let them wait upon the Lord who hides his face. There is a world without end; and it will be well or ill with us, according as it shall be with us in that world. The Lord we serve and trust, is God alone. All that God has said is plain, satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us to seek him, so he never denied believing prayers, nor disappointed believing expectations. He gives grace sufficient, and comfort and satisfaction of soul.</body></html>
