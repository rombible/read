This second motive is, in a certain sense, the main one. Cyrus is raised up, especially, to perform God's pleasure with respect to Judah and Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26-28</a>). Jacob, his Church, is more important in God's eyes than any individual. No doubt his Church is maintained, in part, that it may be "a light to lighten the Gentiles;" but it is not maintained solely: or even mainly, for this end. Its welfare is an end in itself, and would be sought by God apart from any further consequence. <span class="cmt_word">Israel mine elect</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have surnamed thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "given thee designations of honour," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "my anointed" (ver. 1); "my shepherd" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>); "he who shall do all my pleasure" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Though thou hast not known me; rather, <span class="accented">though thou didst not know me.</span> Cyrus's honours, his titles, his mention by name, etc., were accumulated upon him before his birth, when he knew nothing of God, when, therefore, he had in no way merited them. Thus all was done, not for his sake, but lot the sake of Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-4 Cyrus is called God's anointed; he was designed and qualified for his great service by the counsel of God. The gates of Babylon which led to the river, were left open the night that Cyrus marched his army into the empty channel. The Lord went before him, giving entrance to the cities he besieged. He gave him also treasures, which had been hidden in secret places. The true God was to Cyrus an unknown God; yet God foreknew him; he called him by his name. The exact fulfilment of this must have shown Cyrus that Jehovah was the only true God, and that it was for the sake of Israel that he was prospered. In all the changes of states and kingdoms, God works out the good of his church.</body></html>
