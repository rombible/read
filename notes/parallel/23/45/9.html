Were those who strove, the heathen nations who resisted Cyrus, or Israelites who desired some other deliverer, say a prince of the house of David? The latter seems more probable. In either case men were guilty of the folly of criticising the Almighty.<p><span class= "bld">Let the potsherd strive . . .</span>--The sentence, as the italics show, is abrupt, but is better taken without inserting the verbs, and in apposition with the pronoun--<span class= "ital">Woe unto him </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "ital">a potsherd among the potsherds; </span>a frail mortal like all his fellows.<p><span class= "bld">Shall the clay say . . .</span>--The potsherd suggests the potter, not without an allusive reference to the history of man's creation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/18-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 18:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-20.htm" title="No but, O man, who are you that reply against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?">Romans 9:20-21</a>, the thought pressed is that of absolute sovereignty, the belief in the wisdom and equity of that sovereignty being kept in the background, as a reserve force. The two clauses represent different aspects of presumption--the first questions, the other arrogantly condemns. The potter's vessel says that the potter "has no hands," is without creative power or skill.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-13.</span> - ISRAEL WARNED NOT TO CALL IN QUESTION GOD'S MODES OF ACTION. Apparently, Isaiah anticipates that the Israelites will be discontented and murmur at their deliverer being a heathen king, and not one of their own body. He therefore warns them against presuming to criticize the arrangements of the All-Wise, reminding them of his unapproachable greatness (ver. 12), and once more assuring them that the appointment of Cyrus is from him (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!</span> Let the potsherd strive, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">woe unto him that striveth with his Maker</span>, <span class="accented">a potsherd among potsherds of the ground</span>: All men are equally made of "the dust of the ground" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Israel has no prerogative in this respect. He, too, is "a potsherd among potsherds" - day moulded by the potter; no more entitled to lift up his voice against his Maker than the vessel to rebel against the man who shapes it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; and see the comment furnished by St. Paul in the Epistle to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-24</a>). What would a man think if the clay that he was fashioning objected to being moulded in a particular form, or if a work that he had made exclaimed, "He is a poor bungler - he hath no hands"? Yet this is what a man does who finds fault with the arrangements of the Almighty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:5-10 There is no God beside Jehovah. There is nothing done without him. He makes peace, put here for all good; and creates evil, not the evil of sin, but the evil of punishment. He is the Author of all that is true, holy, good, or happy; and evil, error, and misery, came into the world by his permission, through the wilful apostacy of his creatures, but are restrained and overruled to his righteous purpose. This doctrine is applied, for the comfort of those that earnestly longed, yet quietly waited, for the redemption of Israel. The redemption of sinners by the Son of God, and the pouring out the Spirit, to give success to the gospel, are chiefly here intended. We must not expect salvation without righteousness; together the Lord hath created them. Let not oppressors oppose God's designs for his people. Let not the poor oppressed murmur, as if God dealt unkindly with them. Men are but earthen pots; they are broken potsherds, and are very much made so by mutual contentions. To contend with Him is as senseless as for clay to find fault with the potter. Let us turn God's promises into prayers, beseeching him that salvation may abound among us, and let us rest assured that the Judge of all the earth will do right.</body></html>
