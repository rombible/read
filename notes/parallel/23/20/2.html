Month by month, for three whole years, he was seen in the streets of Jerusalem as one who was already as a prisoner of war, ready to be led into an ignominious exile. The "sackcloth" was the "rough garment" which, like Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm" title="And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.">2Kings 1:8</a>) and John the Baptist, the prophets habitually wore (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he has prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:">Zechariah 13:4</a>), and the "nakedness<span class= "ital">" </span>was confined to the laying aside this outer robe, and appearing in the short tunic worn near the body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm" title="And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Why they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm" title="Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat to him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.">John 21:7</a>). Like instances of prophetic symbolism are the horns of Zedekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm" title="And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus said the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.">1Kings 22:11</a>, the yokes worn by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,">Jeremiah 27:2</a>), Ezekiel's lying on his side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm" title="Lie you also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it you shall bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 4:4</a>), and the girdle with which Agabus bound himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Loose the sackcloth from off thy loins</span>. Dr. Kay supposes that Isaiah was wearing sackcloth exceptionally, as during a time of mourning. But it is more probable that the Hebrew <span class="accented">sak</span> represents the haircloth ("rough garment," <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>), which, as ascetics, the Hebrew prophets wore habitually (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Walking naked</span>. Probably not actually "naked," for captives were not stripped bare by the Assyrians, but with nothing on besides his short tunic, as the male captives are commonly represented in the Assyrian sculptures. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 The invasion and conquest of Egypt and Ethiopia. - Isaiah was a sign to the people by his unusual dress, when he walked abroad. He commonly wore sackcloth as a prophet, to show himself mortified to the world. He was to loose this from his loins; to wear no upper garments, and to go barefooted. This sign was to signify, that the Egyptians and Ethiopians should be led away captives by the king of Assyria, thus stripped. The world will often deem believers foolish, when singular in obedience to God. But the Lord will support his servants under the most trying effects of their obedience; and what they are called upon to suffer for his sake, commonly is light, compared with what numbers groan under from year to year from sin. Those who make any creature their expectation and glory, and so put it in the place of God, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of it. But disappointment in creature-confidences, instead of driving us to despair, should drive us to God, and our expectation shall not be in vain. The same lesson is in force now; and where shall we look for aid in the hour of necessity, but to the Lord our Righteousness, throne of grace, and serving with each other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes, and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.</body></html>
