The prophet paints the brutality with which prisoners were treated on a march in vivid colours. What would men say of their boasted policy of an Egypto-Cushite alliance when they saw that as its disastrous issue? It may be noted that Rabshakeh's scornful phrase, "This bruised reed," seems to imply that Assyria had ceased to fear the power of Egypt; and Nahum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-8.htm" title="Are you better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?">Nahum 3:8</a>) speaks of No (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>No-Amun or Thebes) as having, when he wrote, been conquered, and his people carried into captivity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall the King of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives</span>. In Sennacherib's annals for the year <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>, twelve years after this prophecy was given, we find the following passage: "The kings of Egypt, and the archers, chariots, and horsemen of the King of Meroe, a force without number, gathered and came to the aid of Ekron. In the neighborhood of Eltekeh their ranks were arrayed before me, and they urged on their soldiers. In the service of Asshur, my lord, I fought with them, and I accomplished their overthrow. <span class="accented">The charioteers and sons of the kings of Egypt</span>, <span class="accented">and the charioteers of the King of Meres</span>, <span class="accented">alive in the midst of the battle</span>, <span class="accented">my hand captured"</span> (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, 134). <span class="cmt_word">Young and old</span>. The intermixture of young and old, of full-grown males with women leading children by the hand or carrying them upon the shoulder, in the Assyrian sculptures, strikes us even on the most cursory inspection of them. <span class="cmt_word">Naked and barefoot</span>. Assyrian captives are ordinarily represented "barefoot." Most commonly they wear a single tunic, reaching from the neck to the knees, or sometimes to the ankles, and girt about the waist with a girdle. It is probable that Egyptian and Ethiopian prisoners would be even more scantily clad, since the ordinary Egyptian tunic began at the waist and ended considerably above the knee. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 The invasion and conquest of Egypt and Ethiopia. - Isaiah was a sign to the people by his unusual dress, when he walked abroad. He commonly wore sackcloth as a prophet, to show himself mortified to the world. He was to loose this from his loins; to wear no upper garments, and to go barefooted. This sign was to signify, that the Egyptians and Ethiopians should be led away captives by the king of Assyria, thus stripped. The world will often deem believers foolish, when singular in obedience to God. But the Lord will support his servants under the most trying effects of their obedience; and what they are called upon to suffer for his sake, commonly is light, compared with what numbers groan under from year to year from sin. Those who make any creature their expectation and glory, and so put it in the place of God, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of it. But disappointment in creature-confidences, instead of driving us to despair, should drive us to God, and our expectation shall not be in vain. The same lesson is in force now; and where shall we look for aid in the hour of necessity, but to the Lord our Righteousness, throne of grace, and serving with each other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes, and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.</body></html>
