In the Church of the redeemed there will be "weak" brethren as well as strong, "feeble" as well as healthful (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>). God, by the mouth of his prophet, calls on the strong to impart of their strength to their weaker brethren, uplifting their "weak hands," as Aaron and Hur did those of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>), and "confirming" or sustaining their "feeble knees." So St. Paul: "We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-4 Judea was prosperous in the days of Hezekiah, but the kingdom of Christ is the great subject intended. Converting grace makes the soul that was a wilderness, to rejoice with joy and singing, and to blossom abundantly. The feeble and faint-hearted are encouraged. This is the design of the gospel. Fear is weakening; the more we strive against it, the stronger we are, both for doing and suffering; and he that says to us, Be strong, has laid help for us upon One who is mighty. Assurance is given of the approach of Messiah, to take vengeance on the powers of darkness, to recompense with abundant comforts those that mourn in Zion; He will come and save. He will come again at the end of time, to punish those who have troubled his people; and to give those who were troubled such rest as will be a full reward for all their troubles.</body></html>
