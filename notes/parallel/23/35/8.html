(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Judges 5:6</a>.) We are still in the region of parables, but the thought has a special interest as a transition, at the close of the first volume of Isaiah's writings, to the opening of the second. The use of the road has been referred, by some interpreters, to the return of the exiles from Babylon. Rather is it the road by which the pilgrims of all nations shall journey to the mountain of the Lord's house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The way of holiness . . .</span>--The name of the road confirms the interpretation just given. There was to be a true <span class= "ital">Via Sacra </span>to the earthly temple, as the type of that eternal Temple, not made with hands, which also was in the prophet's thoughts. Along that road there would be no barbarous invaders polluting the ground they trod, no Jews ceremonially or spiritually unclean. The picture of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>) into which "there entereth nothing that defileth," presents a like feature. <span class= "ital">It shall be for them, i.e.<span class= "bld"> . .</span> .</span> <span class= "ital">It is appointed for those, for whosoever walketh therein </span>(the Hebrew verb is in the singular). Then, in strict order, comes the final clause: <span class= "ital">Even the simple ones shall not lose their way. </span>A curious parallel is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm" title="The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city.">Ecclesiastes 10:15</a>, where "he knoweth not how to go to the city," is one of the notes of the man who is void of understanding.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And an highway shall be there, and a way</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>). There shall be a clear "way" marked out in which all shall be bound to walk - a "strait and narrow way" doubtless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-14.htm">Matthew 7:14</a>), but one not readily missed. <span class="cmt_word">The way shall be called The way of holiness</span>. It shall be that path through the dangers and difficulties of life which holiness points out and requires. The unclean shall not pass over it. It is tempting to imagine that there is here a reference to the famous <span class="accented">chinvat peretu</span> of the Zoro-astrians - the "bridge of the gatherer" - along which all souls had to pass in order to reach the abode of the blessed, but which the souls of the wicked never succeeded in passing ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 339). The 'bridge of the gatherer" is, however, in the other world, not in this world; but Isaiah's "highway" is here. It is that right course of life, which "the unclean" do not follow, though they might do so if they chose, but which the righteous follow to their great gain and advantage. <span class="cmt_word">But it shall be for those</span>; rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">but he shall be with them</span>; God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall be with those who seek to walk in the way, and not to err from it. He shall direct them, support them, sustain their footsteps. <span class="cmt_word">The wayfaring men</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they that walk in the way - that</span> make up their minds to try to walk in it. Though fools; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> however simple and unlearned they may be - "Ne simplicissimi quidem" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not err therein</span>; shall not wander from the way through mere simplicity. It shall be easy to find, difficult to miss. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:5-10 When Christ shall come to set up his kingdom in the world, then wonders, great wonders, shall be wrought on men's souls. By the word and Spirit of Christ, the spiritually blind were enlightened; and those deaf to the calls of God were made to hear them readily. Those unable to do any thing good, by Divine grace were made active therein. Those that knew not how to speak of God or to God, had their lips opened to show forth his praise. When the Holy Ghost came upon the Gentiles that heard the word, then were the fountains of life opened. Most of the earth is still a desert; neither means of grace, spiritual worshippers, nor fruits of holiness, are to be found in it. But the way of religion and godliness shall be laid open. The way of holiness is the way of God's commandment; it is the good old way. And the way to heaven is a plain way. Those knowing but little, and unlearned, shall be kept from missing the road. It shall be a safe way; nothing can do them any real hurt. Christ, the way to God, shall be clearly made known; and the way of a believer's duty shall be plainly marked out. Let us then go forward cheerfully, assured that the end of this way shall be everlasting joy, and rest for the soul. Those who by faith are made citizens of the gospel Zion, rejoice in Christ Jesus; and their sorrows and sighs are made to flee away by Divine consolations. Thus these prophecies conclude. Our joyful hopes and prospects of eternal life should swallow up all the sorrows and all the joys of this present time. But of what avail is it to admire the excellence of God's word, unless we can call its precious promises our own? Do we love God, not only as our Creator, but because he gave his only Son to die for us? And are we walking in the ways of holiness? Let us try ourselves by such plain questions, rather than spend time on things that may be curious and amusing, but are unprofitable.</body></html>
