On the punishment of God's enemies will follow the peace, prosperity, and glory of his Church. Previously, the Church is in affliction, waste, and desolate. Its enemies once removed, destroyed, swept out of the way, it rises instantly in all its beauty to a condition which words are poor to paint. The highest resources of the poetic art are called in to give some idea of the glory and happiness of the final Church of the redeemed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them</span>; rather, the <span class="accented">wilderness</span>, <span class="accented">and the dry place</span>, <span class="accented">shall be glad</span>. The Church, that has been long wasted and kept under by the wicked, shall, at their destruction, feel a sense of relief, and so of joy. <span class="cmt_word">The desert shall rejoice, and blossom.</span> The first result of the joy shall be a putting forth of lovely products. Blossoms, beautiful as the rose or the <span class="accented">narcissus</span> (Kay), shall spring up all over the parched ground, and make it a parterre of flowers. The blossoms are either graces unknown in the time of affliction, or saintly characters of a new and high type. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-4 Judea was prosperous in the days of Hezekiah, but the kingdom of Christ is the great subject intended. Converting grace makes the soul that was a wilderness, to rejoice with joy and singing, and to blossom abundantly. The feeble and faint-hearted are encouraged. This is the design of the gospel. Fear is weakening; the more we strive against it, the stronger we are, both for doing and suffering; and he that says to us, Be strong, has laid help for us upon One who is mighty. Assurance is given of the approach of Messiah, to take vengeance on the powers of darkness, to recompense with abundant comforts those that mourn in Zion; He will come and save. He will come again at the end of time, to punish those who have troubled his people; and to give those who were troubled such rest as will be a full reward for all their troubles.</body></html>
