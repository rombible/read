The outward imagery probably had its starting-point in the processions of the pilgrims who came up to the Temple singing psalms, like those known as the "songs of degrees" at their successive halting-places (Psalms 120-134).<p><span class= "bld">Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span>--The words have a special interest as being the closing utterance of Isaiah's political activity, written, therefore, probably, in his old age, and in the midst of much trouble, whether he wrote at the close of Hezekiah's reign, or the beginning of Manasseh's, which must have been sufficiently dark and gloomy. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-26.htm" title="Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not on them in the days of Hezekiah.">2Chronicles 32:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/33-1.htm" title="Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:">2Chronicles 33:1-10</a>.) The hopes of the prophet were, however, inextinguishable, and they formed a natural starting-point for the words: "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people," with which the second collection opens, the intermediate chapters being obviously of the nature of an historical appendix. They find their echo in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm" title="For the Lamb which is in the middle of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.">Revelation 7:17</a>, "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ransomed of the Lord shall return</span>. The blessedness of the last times would be incomplete to Jewish ideas without this crowning feature. There had already been a great dispersion of the faithful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7-9</a>); there was to be a still greater one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>); Israel could not be content or happy until her "outcasts" were recalled, "the dispersed of Judah gathered together from the four corners of the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). The return here prophesied is again announced, in almost the same words, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With songs</span> (see the comment on ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">Everlasting joy upon their heads</span>.

By the word and Spirit of Christ, the spiritually blind were enlightened; and those deaf to the calls of God were made to hear them readily. Those unable to do any thing good, by Divine grace were made active therein. Those that knew not how to speak of God or to God, had their lips opened to show forth his praise. When the Holy Ghost came upon the Gentiles that heard the word, then were the fountains of life opened. Most of the earth is still a desert; neither means of grace, spiritual worshippers, nor fruits of holiness, are to be found in it. But the way of religion and godliness shall be laid open. The way of holiness is the way of God's commandment; it is the good old way. And the way to heaven is a plain way. Those knowing but little, and unlearned, shall be kept from missing the road. It shall be a safe way; nothing can do them any real hurt. Christ, the way to God, shall be clearly made known; and the way of a believer's duty shall be plainly marked out. Let us then go forward cheerfully, assured that the end of this way shall be everlasting joy, and rest for the soul. Those who by faith are made citizens of the gospel Zion, rejoice in Christ Jesus; and their sorrows and sighs are made to flee away by Divine consolations. Thus these prophecies conclude. Our joyful hopes and prospects of eternal life should swallow up all the sorrows and all the joys of this present time. But of what avail is it to admire the excellence of God's word, unless we can call its precious promises our own? Do we love God, not only as our Creator, but because he gave his only Son to die for us? And are we walking in the ways of holiness? Let us try ourselves by such plain questions, rather than spend time on things that may be curious and amusing, but are unprofitable.</body></html>
