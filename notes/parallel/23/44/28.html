Such a phenomenon admits of three possible explanations:--(1) That it is a prophecy after the event--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that the whole of Isaiah, or this part of it, was written at the close of the exile. (2) That the name was revealed to the prophet in a way altogether supernatural. (3) That the name came within the horizon of the prophet's vision from his natural stand-point, the supernatural element being found in the facts which he is led to connect with it. Of these, (3) seems to commend itself as most analogous with the methods of prophetic teaching. The main facts in the case are these--(1) Events had made Isaiah acquainted with the name of the Medes, and with a people bearing the name (Elam), afterwards given by the Jews to the Persians of the Greeks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-7.htm" title="Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm" title="A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm" title="And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:">2Kings 18:11</a>). (2) <span class= "ital">Koresh </span>or <span class= "ital">Kyros </span>was the name of a river in that region, and the conqueror is said to have changed his previous name (Agradates) for it (Strab. Xv. 3, 6). (3) The name has been said to mean "the sun" (Plutarch, Ctesias), and this, though not accepted by many modern scholars as philologically accurate, at least indicates that the Greeks assigned that meaning to it. It would be a natural name for one who, as a worshipper of Ormuzd, saw in the sun the supreme symbol of the God of heaven. (4) The grandfather of the great Cyrus is said to have borne the same name (Herod. i. 111). (5) The facts point to the conclusion that the name <span class= "ital">Kursus; </span>if not a titular epithet, like the Pharaoh of Egypt, may yet have had the prestige of antiquity and dignity, historical or mythical. (6) Is it altogether impossible that the prophecy, circulating among the Babylonian exiles, helped to bring about its own fulfilment, and that Agradates may have been led to take the name of <span class= "ital">Kur'us </span>because he found his work described in connection with it (Josh. <span class= "ital">Ant., </span>xii. 1, 2)?<p><span class= "bld">My shepherd.</span>--As guiding the flock of Jehovah, each to their own pasture.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt be built.</span>--Both verbs are better taken as imperatives, <span class= "ital">Let her be built; Let thy foundations be laid.</span><p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That saith of Cyrus</span>. The mention of Cyrus by name, here and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, has no doubt been one of the main grounds on which has been set up the theory of two Isaiahs. It has been thought incredible, or at any rate contrary to the analogy of prophetical revelation, that so minute a matter as the name of a man should have been announced in prophecy more than a century before his birth. There is, however, the parallel case of Josiah, who, according to the author of the Books of Kings, was announced by name more than three centuries before his birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>). And there are the extremely minute facts noted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, which were prophetically de-dared from two centuries to three centuries and a half before they happened. It is, perhaps, assuming that we know more than we really do know about the object and laws of prophetic utterance, to lay it down that there can be no minute prophecy except when the prophet is living in the midst of the events. It is certainly a very marvellous thing that Isaiah, living at the close of the eighth and the beginning of the <span class="date">seventh century B.C.</span>, should -mention a king by name who did not ascend the throne till the middle of the sixth; but no one can suppose that God could not have made such a revelation to him if he pleased. An attempt to minimize the marvel, without postulating two Isaiahs, has been made by the supposition that "Cyrus" was not really a proper name, but an old title of the Persian (Achaemenian) kings, signifying" the sun," and that Isaiah, therefore, only meant to point out Persia as the power which would destroy Babylon, which he had already done in effect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>. But, in reality, there is no sufficient ground for either of the two statements <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Cyrus meant "the sun," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That "Cyrus" meant "the sun," rests upon the weak authorities of Plutarch and Ctesias, and has been disproved by Sir H. Rawlinson ('Cuneiform Inscriptions,' vol. 2, p. 112). That it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings is directly contrary to the evidence. Out of fourteen Achaemenian kings, two only bore the name; and they bore it as their one and only personal appellation. It was also borne by an Achaemenian prince who had no other name. It is as purely a proper name as Cambyses, or Xerxes, or Darius. The theory of Dean Plumptre ('Biblical Studies,' p. 195) must therefore be set aside as untenable, and we must face the fact that the great Cyrus, who reigned from <span class="date">B.C. 559</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 529</span>, is mentioned in prophecies attributed to a writer whose death cannot be placed much later than <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>. The name which the Greeks expressed by <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the Romans by "Cyrus," is in the original Persian <span class="accented">Kurush</span>, in the old Babylonian <span class="accented">Kuras</span>, and in the Hebrew <span class="accented">Koresh. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He is my shepherd</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not a mere ordinary king, who was often called "the shepherd of his people (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)," but "my shepherd" - the shepherd of my people, who will tend them and care for them. <span class="cmt_word">And shall perform</span> (literally, <span class="accented">accomplish</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all my pleasure</span>. Cyrus is said by Josephus to have had ibis prophecy pointed out to him on his conquest of Babylon, and to have thereupon determined to fulfil what was written ('Ant. Jud.,' 12:1, &sect; 2). His edict, reported by Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2-4</a>), contained a statement that "Jehovah had charged him to build him a house at Jerusalem." It is difficult to see any sufficient <span class="accented">political</span> object for his restoration of the Jews to their country. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be built</span>; rather, <span class="accented">it shall be built. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy foundation shall be laid</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it shall be founded.</span> The decree of Cyrus found by Darius at Ecbatana required that "the foundations of the house should be strongly laid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a>), and prescribed its dimensions and materials. (On the actual laying of the foundations, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8-13</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:21-28 Return unto me. It is the great concern of those who have backslidden from God, like the Jews of old, to hasten their return to him. The work of redemption wrought for us by Christ, encourages to hope for all blessings from him. Our transgressions and our sins are as a thick cloud between heaven and earth: sins separate between us and God; they threaten a storm of wrath. When God pardons sin, he blots out, he dispels this cloud, this thick cloud, so that the way to heaven is open again. The cloud is scattered by the Sun of righteousness; it is quite gone. The comforts that flow into the soul when sin is pardoned, are like clear shining after clouds and rain. Let not Israel be discouraged; nothing is too hard for God: having made all, he can make what use he pleases of any. Those that learn to know Christ, see all knowledge to be foolishness, in comparison with the knowledge of him. And his enemies will find their counsels turned into foolishness, and themselves taken in their craftiness. The exact fulfilling the prophecies of Scripture confirms the truth of the whole, and proves its Divine origin. The particular favours God designed for his people in captivity, were foretold here, long before they went into captivity. Very great difficulties would be in the way of their deliverance; but it is promised that by Divine power they should all be removed. God knew who should be the Deliverer of his people; and let his church know it, that when they heard such a name talked of, they might know their redemption drew nigh. It is the greatest honour of the greatest men, to be employed as instruments of the Divine favour to his people. In things wherein men serve themselves, and look no further, God makes them do all his pleasure. And a nobler Shepherd than Cyrus does his Father's will, till his work is fully completed.</body></html>
