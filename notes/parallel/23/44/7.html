and I shall set glory in the land of the living;">Ezekiel 26:20</a>. Here it has been referred either to the antediluvian fathers of mankind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm" title="Have you marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?">Job 22:15</a>) or to the patriarchs of Israel, or, more fitly, to Israel, as having before it a far-off future as well as a far-off past, and, therefore, <span class= "ital">an everlasting people. </span>The same phrase is used for the "perpetual covenant" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-16.htm" title="Why the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.">Exodus 31:16</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm" title="And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.">Exodus 40:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2Samuel 7:16</a>.)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, as I, shall call</span>, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Who will do (or who <span class="accented">can</span> do) as I do - call events into being, declare them, and set them in order beforehand - who can do this for me (or, in my stead)? No one. I have done it, ever since I appointed (or, placed upon earth) the ancient people" that is, the race of men before the Flood (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>). The claim is that, from the first creation of mankind, God has not only prearranged the events that should happen, but has declared them by the mouth of prophets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>, 23; 9:12-16, etc.). No other has done the same. <span class="cmt_word">The things that are coming, and shall come</span>. Not earlier and later events, but "future events," and "such as will actually come to pass" (Kay, Cheyne). Let the idol-gods declare these, if they are to be entitled to consideration. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-8 Israel is here called Jeshurun, which means the upright one. Such only are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile. Those that serve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and in their services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as water refreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influences the soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, the plentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where God gives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Who can compare with Israel's Redeemer and King?</body></html>
