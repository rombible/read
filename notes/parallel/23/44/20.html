The first, however, has the merit of greater vividness. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm" title="Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind: he daily increases lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.">Hosea 12:1</a>.) The "ashes" of the smith's furnace become the symbols of the vanity of his work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm" title="For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>), and yet he has not even the germ of truth which lies in the questions of the sceptic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He feedeth on ashes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. on</span> vanity - on what can give no support or sustenance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-14.htm">Proverbs 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A deceived heart</span>. Either self-deceived, or imposed upon by illusions from without; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the seeming power of the idols, as seen in the victories and conquests of their worshippers. <span class="cmt_word">He cannot deliver his soul</span>. The deceived soul is bound in trammels, which it feels to be irksome, and from which it would fain be free. But it cannot deliver itself. Deliverance must come from some external source; in other words, man needs a Deliverer. <span class="cmt_word">Is there not a lie in my right hand?</span> An idol is "a lie." It professes to have power, strength, ability to help and save, whereas it has no power at all. It cannot even save itself. Savages often beat their fetishes. Diagoras of Melos threw an image of Hercules into the fire on which he was cooking his dinner, and bade Hercules make himself of some use by boiling his turnips. The powerlessness of idols even to help themselves is represented with much force in the Book of Baruch (6:12-15, 17-22, 27, 49, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:9-20 Image-making is described, to expose the folly of idolaters. Though a man had used part of a log for fuel, he fell down before an image made of the remainder, praying it to deliver him. Man greatly dishonours God, when he represents him after the image of man. Satan blinds the eyes of unbelievers, causing absurd reasonings in matters of religion. Whether men seek happiness in worldly things, or run into unbelief, superstition, or any false system, they feed on ashes. A heart deceived by pride, love of sin, and departure from God, turns men aside from his holy truth and worship. While the affections are depraved, a man holds fast the lie as his best treasure. Are our hearts set upon the wealth of the world and its pleasures? They will certainly prove a lie. If we trust to outward professions and doings, as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves. Self-suspicion is the first step towards self-deliverance. He that would deliver his soul, must question his conscience, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</body></html>
