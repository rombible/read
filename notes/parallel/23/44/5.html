It was usual among the heathen nations to mark the name of a god upon the bodies of persons specially devoted to him (Herod., 2:113; 7:235); and, though the practice was forbidden to Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), it might naturally continue in use among semi-heathen proselytes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-8 Israel is here called Jeshurun, which means the upright one.

Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Who can compare with Israel's Redeemer and King?</body></html>
