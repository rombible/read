The captive Jews, dwelling scattered in a land the inhabitants of which were, one and all, idolaters, and having by hereditary taint an inclination to idolatry, would be easily tempted, during the long and weary period of the Captivity, to put away the worship and even the thought of Jehovah, who had allowed their subjugation, and conform to the religion of their conquerors. Hence the repeated contrasts in these later chapters - specially addressed to <span class="accented">caprice</span> Israel - between Jehovah and idols, and the sharp ridicule of the latter (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4-7, 21-29</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord the King of Israel</span>. Therefore entitled to Israel's allegiance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>). And his Redeemer; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Israel's Redeemer - he who had redeemed them from Egyptian bondage - who will redeem them from the power of Babylon - who, best of all, will redeem them from their sins. <span class="cmt_word">The First... the Last</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, with the comment). <span class="cmt_word">Beside me there is no God</span>. This had been distinctly asserted in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>); but Israel could not be induced practically to believe it. The "gods of the nations" were supposed generally to be realities, actual powers, not perhaps so potent as Jehovah, but still real beings, capable of doing good and harm (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>). It is one of Isaiah's special objects in these later chapters to disabuse Israel of this notion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5, 6, 14-22</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-8 Israel is here called Jeshurun, which means the upright one. Such only are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile. Those that serve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and in their services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as water refreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influences the soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, the plentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where God gives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Who can compare with Israel's Redeemer and King?</body></html>
