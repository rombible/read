It is not the union of material or spiritual blessings, but first the symbol, and then the reality. The "thirst" is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm" title="As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you, O God.">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-13.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:">John 4:13-14</a>. In the promise of the Spirit we have an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will pour water upon him that is thirsty</span>. "Water" is, in Isaiah, the common metaphor for Divine grace. Sometimes, as in this place (and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), the simple <span class="accented">maim</span>, "water" or "waters," is the word used. At other times we have instead, or in addition, "rain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>), or "dew" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>), or "rivers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, etc.), or "streams" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>), or "floods" (as in this place). At his coming on earth, our blessed Lord took up the comparison, and has made it familiar to all men throughout the whole Christian world (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10, 11, 13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>). We may note here that the "water" is only poured on him who is athirst for it. <span class="cmt_word">Thy seed... thine offspring</span>. Not "Israel after the flesh" only, but also Israel after the Spirit - the true "Israel of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:1-8 Israel is here called Jeshurun, which means the upright one. Such only are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile. Those that serve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and in their services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as water refreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influences the soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, the plentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where God gives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Who can compare with Israel's Redeemer and King?</body></html>
