This section is closely connected with ch. 43, of which it ought to form the conclusion.

Accordingly, he holds out, in the present passage, the double hope <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the blessing of an abundant outpouring of the Spirit, to take the place of the preceding "curse" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of a pressing of proselytes into the renovated Church, who will hold it in honour, instead of making it the object of their "reproaches." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet now hear</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be not dismayed at what has been said.

Such only are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile. Those that serve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and in their services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as water refreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influences the soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, the plentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where God gives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Who can compare with Israel's Redeemer and King?</body></html>
