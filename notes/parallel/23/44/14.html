The "cypress" is probably the <span class= "ital">Quercus ilex, </span>and the "ash" a <span class= "ital">fig tree; </span>but the identification of trees in the language of a remote time and language is always somewhat uncertain.<p><span class= "bld">Which he strengtheneth for himself.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">fixeth his choice among. </span>The eye travels, it will be noted, backward from the workshop.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cedars... cypress... oak</span>. The second of the trees mentioned is more probably the ilex than the cypress, which does not grow either in Palestine or in Babylonia. Idols would be made of cedar on account of its fragrance, of flex and oak on account of their hardness and durability. Cedar was used as a material for carved figures in Egypt (Birch, 'Contents of British Museum,' p. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest</span>. The meaning is obscure. Dr. Kay translates, "and he <span class="accented">encourages himself in</span> the trees of the forest," which conveys no very distinct idea; Delitzsch, "and he <span class="accented">chooses</span> for himself among the trees," etc., which is sufficiently clear, but scarcely obtainable from the Hebrew text; Knobel, "he makes himself secure among the trees" (by putting a mark on those which he intends to have), which imparts an idea certainly not contained in the original. <span class="cmt_word">He planteth an ash</span>. It is uncertain, and it does not greatly matter, what tree is intended. The point is that, before trees can grow up, they have to be planted, and that, for them to grow when planted, God's gift of rain is necessary (see the comment on ver. 13). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:9-20 Image-making is described, to expose the folly of idolaters. Though a man had used part of a log for fuel, he fell down before an image made of the remainder, praying it to deliver him. Man greatly dishonours God, when he represents him after the image of man. Satan blinds the eyes of unbelievers, causing absurd reasonings in matters of religion. Whether men seek happiness in worldly things, or run into unbelief, superstition, or any false system, they feed on ashes. A heart deceived by pride, love of sin, and departure from God, turns men aside from his holy truth and worship. While the affections are depraved, a man holds fast the lie as his best treasure. Are our hearts set upon the wealth of the world and its pleasures? They will certainly prove a lie. If we trust to outward professions and doings, as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves. Self-suspicion is the first step towards self-deliverance. He that would deliver his soul, must question his conscience, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</body></html>
