Only one fast, that of the Day of Atonement, was prescribed by the Law. In practice, however, they were often held in times of calamity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-12.htm" title="They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.">Isaiah 32:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm" title="Gird yourselves, and lament, you priests: howl, you ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your God.">Joel 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.">2Chronicles 20:3</a>),and we may legitimately think of them as having been more or less frequent under Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/37-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.">Isaiah 37:1-2</a>). Now, as though that had been a meritorious work, the people ask what good had come of it? After the exile fasts were instituted, commemorative of the siege of Jerusalem, its capture, its destruction, and the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-3.htm" title="And to speak to the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?">Zechariah 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.">Zechariah 8:19</a>), and those who maintain the later date of the book naturally suppose that these are the fasts referred to.<p><span class= "bld">In the day of your fast ye find pleasure . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">ye carry on your business. </span>Fasts were not governed, like the Sabbath, by a fixed law, and the people consequently lost sight of the true end of fasting--prayer, meditation, penitence.<p><span class= "bld">Exact all your labours.</span>--The words are rendered by some critics more vividly, though with the same meaning, <span class= "ital">ye oppress all your labourers. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-4.htm" title="Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.">James 5:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/58.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?</span> The fasting' spoken of is probably that of the great Day of Atonement. the only fasting commanded in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29, 31</a>). Other fasts were from time to time appointed by civil or ecclesiastical authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9, 12</a>:<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12, 15</a>); but they were rare, and do not seem to be here intended. Still, the lesson is general, and would apply to all occasions of fasting. The Jews of the time expected, it would seem, some special definite result, in the way of victory or relief, to follow from their observance of the Atonement fast. As it did not follow, they regarded themselves as ill used, and accordingly made complaint. Their feelings approached to those of the Vedic worshippers, who regarded their religious observances as "not merely pleasing. the god who was the object of them, but as laying him under a binding obligation, and almost compelling him to grant the requests of the worshipper" ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 143, 144). Afflicted our soul These are the exact words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29, 31</a>, by which the fast of the great Day of Atonement was instituted. <span class="cmt_word">And thou takest no knowledge</span>; rather, <span class="accented">no notice. <span class="cmt_word"></span>In the day of your fast ye find pleasure</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne render, "ye carry on business," which accords better with the clause which follows. The great Day of Atonement was, like the sabbath, a day on which no work was to be done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>). The Jews, while priding themselves on their observance of the day, did not really observe it in this particular. <span class="cmt_word">And exact all your labours</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "require of your servants and subordinates all the services that they have to render on other days." Days of religious observance, even under the Law, were always intended to be days of kindly forbearance towards the poor, of the remission of burdens, or even of the actual giving of relief. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/58.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>58:3-12 A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it does not express true sorrow for sin, and does not promote the putting away of sin, it is not a fast. These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
