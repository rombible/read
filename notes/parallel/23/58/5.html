In contrast with this we have the picture, reminding us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm" title="Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:16</a>, of the mechanical prostrations, which are as the waving of a bulrush in the breeze. The image suggests a new aspect of our Lord's statement, that the Baptist was not as "a reed shaken by the wind" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-7.htm" title="And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?">Matthew 11:7</a>), <span class= "ital">scil., </span>that his fasting was not outward and ceremonial, like that of the Pharisees.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/58.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is it such a fast that I have chosen</span>, etc.? Do you suppose that such can be the fast commanded by me in the Law - a fast which is expressly called "a day for a man to afflict his soul"? Is afflicting one's soul simply bowing down one's head as a bulrush, and making one's couch on sackcloth and ashes? Surely it is much more than this. (On the employment of "sackcloth and ashes" in fasting, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-3.htm">Esther 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/58.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>58:3-12 A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it does not express true sorrow for sin, and does not promote the putting away of sin, it is not a fast. These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
