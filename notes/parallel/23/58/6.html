So in the practice of the ancient Church fasting and almsgiving were closely connected, as indeed they are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm" title="Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:16</a>. The history of the emancipation of the slaves and of their subsequent return to bondage presents a curious illustration of the prophet's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/34-8.htm" title="This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;">Jeremiah 34:8-22</a>). The truth which he proclaimed was recognised in the hour of danger and forgotten in that of safety. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm" title="And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil.">Joel 2:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To undo the heavy burdens.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the thongs of the yoke, </span>the leather straps which fastened the yoke on the head of the oxen as they ploughed. Again we trace an echo of the thought and almost of the phraseology in our Lord's teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-29.htm" title="Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.">Matthew 11:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm" title="For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.">Matthew 23:4</a>). The Pharisees who fasted laid heavy burdens on men's shoulders. He, who was thought not to fast, relieved them of their two-fold yoke of evil selfishness and ceremonial formalism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/58.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not this the fast that I have chosen?</span> This passage, as Dr. Kay observes, "stands like a homily for the Day of Atonement." Such homilies are found in the uninspired Jewish writings ('Taanith,' 2:1; 'Nedarim babli,' p. 10, a, etc.), and are conceived very much in the same spirit. The Jews call the true fast "the fasting of the heart." To loose the bands of wickedness. To set free those whom wicked persons have wrongfully imprisoned or entangled. <span class="cmt_word">To undo the heavy burdens</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to untie the thongs of the yoke.</span> The liberation of a man's slaves, or of Jews captive among the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-8.htm">Nehemiah 5:8</a>), is probably intended. To let the oppressed (literally, <span class="accented">the bruised</span>) go free. Remission of debts and restoration of pledges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>) are, perhaps, the acts pointed at. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/58.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>58:3-12 A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it does not express true sorrow for sin, and does not promote the putting away of sin, it is not a fast. These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
