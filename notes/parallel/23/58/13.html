While the fasting of the day only required to be spiritualized, the sabbath observance needed both spiritualizing and increased strictness. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a> we learn that the sabbatical years had been little observed during the later Jewish kingdom; and it would Seem from the present passage (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) that even the observance of the sabbath itself had been neglected. Not that the neglect was total. The sacrifices proper to the sabbath were duly offered - the "solemn assembly" was duly called and attended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>); but during the rest of the day business flowed in its usual course - the complete sanctification of the entire day was set aside. We find a similar laxity prevalent after the return from the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> treat it with reverence, as if it were "holy ground" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>). From doing thy pleasure; rather, <span class="accented">from doing thy business -</span> the same expression as in ver. 3. It is by "business," not by pleasure, that the sabbath was polluted both in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) and of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>, etc.). And call the sabbath a delight. This is the spiritualization of the sabbath - "to call" and feel it "a delight," a real satisfaction to the soul, not a weariness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), as it was to many. And shalt honour him; rather, <span class="accented">and shalt honour it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sabbath, which is made masculine here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>. The sabbath was to be honoured by men not pursuing their own ordinary ways, or engaging in their regular business, or even carrying on their ordinary everyday talk. Literally, the command is, not to "speak words;" but no Jews were ever such strict sabbatarians as to understand this as prohibiting <span class="accented">all</span> speech on the sabbath. Some have held that sabbatical talk should be scanty, limited, restrained as much as possible; but even for this there is no warrant. It is the quality, rather than the quantity, of the words uttered that is of real importance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/58.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>58:13,14 The sabbath is a sign between God and his professing people; his appointing it is a sign of his favour to them; and their observing it is a sign of their obedience to him. We must turn from travelling on that day; from doing our pleasure on that holy day, without the control and restraint of conscience; or from indulging in the pleasures of sense. On sabbath days we must not follow our callings, or our pleasures. In all we say and do, we must put a difference between this day and other days. Even in Old Testament times the sabbath was called the Lord's day, and is fitly called so still; and for a further reason, it is the Lord Christ's day, Re 1:10. If we thus remember the sabbath day to keep it holy, we shall have the comfort and profit of it, and have reason to say, It is good to draw near to God.</body></html>
