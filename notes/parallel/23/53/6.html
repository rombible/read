He prays to the Father, "Let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but <span class="accented">as thou wilt"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). So St. John says that the Father "sent the Son to be the Propitiation for our sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). And St. Paul tells us that God (the Father) "made him to be sin for us who knew no sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). It does not lessen the Son's exceeding mercy and loving-kindness in accepting the burden, that it was laid upon him by the Father. <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of us all</span> (compare the initial "All we"). The redemption is as universal as the sin, at any rate potentially. Christ on the cross made "a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice<span class="cmt_word">...</span> for the sins of the whole world." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ; also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.</body></html>
