Perhaps the most touching application is St. Peter's use of them as a thought of comfort for the slaves who were scourged as He, their Lord, had been (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he was wounded for our transgressions</span>. This verse contains four asseverations of the great truth that all Christ's sufferings were for us, and constituted the atonement for our sins. The form is varied, but the truth is one. Christ was "wounded" or "pierced" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the thorns; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the nails; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the spear of the soldier. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The wounds inflicted by the nails caused his death, He was bruised; or, <span class="accented">crushed</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-10.htm">Isaiah 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>). "No stronger expression could be found in Hebrew to denote severity of suffering - suffering unto death" (Urwick). <span class="cmt_word">The chastisement of our peace was upon him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the chastisement which brought us peace," which put a stop to the enmity between fallen man and an offended God - which made them once more <span class="accented">at one</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15-17</a>, "Having <span class="accented">abolished in his flesh the enmity</span>, even the Law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, <span class="accented">so making peace</span>; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, <span class="accented">having slain the enmity thereby:</span> and came and preached <span class="accented">peace</span> to you which were afar off;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, "Having <span class="accented">made peace</span> through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself"). <span class="cmt_word">With his stripes we are healed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">we were healed</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, "By whose stripes ye were healed"). Besides the blows inflicted on him with the hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a>) and with the reed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>), our Lord was judicially scourged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>). Such scourging would leave the "stripe-marks" which are here spoken of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ; also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.</body></html>
