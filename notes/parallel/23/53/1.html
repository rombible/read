The former view commends itself most, and the unusual plural is explained by his mentally associating with himself the other prophets, probably his own disciples, who were delivering the same message. The implied answer to the question may be either "None," or, "Not all." St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias said, Lord, who has believed our report?">Romans 10:16</a>) adopts the latter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath believed?</span> Isaiah felt that he spoke, mainly, to unbelieving ears (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-23.htm">Isaiah 42:23</a>, etc.). The unbelief was likely to be intensified when so marvellous a prophecy was delivered as that which he was now commissioned to put forth. Still, of course, there is rhetorical exaggeration in the question, which seems to imply that no one would believe. Our report; literally, <span class="accented">that which has been heard by us.</span> But the word is used technically for a prophetic revelation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>). Here it would seem to refer especially to the Messianic prophecies delivered by Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</span> The "arm of the Lord," which has been "made bare in the eyes of all the nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>), yet requires the eye of faith to see it. Many Jews would not see the working of God's providence in the victories of Cyrus, or in the decision to which he came to restore the Jews to their own country. Unbelief can always assign the most plainly providential arrangements to happy accident. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:1-3 No where in all the Old Testament is it so plainly and fully prophesied, that Christ ought to suffer, and then to enter into his glory, as in this chapter. But to this day few discern, or will acknowledge, that Divine power which goes with the word. The authentic and most important report of salvation for sinners, through the Son of God, is disregarded. The low condition he submitted to, and his appearance in the world, were not agreeable to the ideas the Jews had formed of the Messiah. It was expected that he should come in pomp; instead of that, he grew up as a plant, silently, and insensibly. He had nothing of the glory which one might have thought to meet with him. His whole life was not only humble as to outward condition, but also sorrowful. Being made sin for us, he underwent the sentence sin had exposed us to. Carnal hearts see nothing in the Lord Jesus to desire an interest in him. Alas! by how many is he still despised in his people, and rejected as to his doctrine and authority!</body></html>
