It admits equally of the sense, <span class= "ital">through oppression and through judgment; </span>and, on the whole, this gives a preferable sense. The whole procedure was tainted with iniquity.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall declare his generation?</span>--The words are, perhaps, the most difficult of the whole section, and have been very differently explained: (1) "Who shall declare his life, the mystery of his birth, his eternal being?" (2) "Who shall count his spiritual offspring?" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm" title="A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.">Psalm 22:30</a>.

Have I been a wilderness to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more to you?">Jeremiah 2:31</a>), who will consider rightly?" (4) "Who shall set forth his generation in all the intensity of their guilt?"--to say nothing of other renderings, which render the noun as "his dwelling," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the grave, or his "course of life," or his "fate." Of these (3) seems most in harmony with the context, the words that follow pointing to the fact which ought to have been considered, and was not, that though the Servant of Jehovah was smitten, it was not for his own sins, but theirs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was taken from prison and from judgment</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by oppression and a judgment was he taken away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (us Dr. Kay says) "by a violence which cloaked itself under the formalities of a legal process." The Septuagint Version, which is quoted by Philip the deacon in the Acts (Isaiah 8:33), must have been derived from quite a different text.

The meaning is obscure. Dr. Kay understands by "his generation," his lifetime or his life, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>, "Mine <span class="accented">age</span> is departed," where the same word is used and accompanied by a pronominal suffix. Mr. Urwick suggests that it includes <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> his origin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his earthly life; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> his everlasting reign in heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Others (Delitzsch, Gesenius, Cheyne) take "his generation" to mean "the men of his generation," and join the clause with what follows: "As for those of his generation, which of them considered that he was cut off," etc.? <span class="cmt_word">He was</span> <span class="cmt_word">cut off;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> taken away before his time, cut down like a flower (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). The land of the living. The present world, the earth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-11.htm">Isaiah 38:11</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-13.htm">Job 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the transgression of my people was he stricken</span>. The sentiment is the same as in ver. 5, but with the difference that there it was suffering only, here it is death itself, which the Servant endures for man. "My people" may be either "God's people" or "the prophet's people," according as the speaker is regarded as Isaiah or Jehovah. Jehovah certainly becomes the Speaker in vers. 11, 12. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ; also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.</body></html>
