and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.">Jeremiah 11:19</a>) appropriates the description to himself. In our Lord's silence before the Sanhedrin and Pilate it is allowable to trace a conscious fulfilment of Isaiah's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-62.htm" title="And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?">Matthew 26:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-14.htm" title="And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor marveled greatly.">Matthew 27:14</a>).

As Israel under the Egyptian taskmasters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The cruel ill usage in the high priest's house, and before Herod is, perhaps, specially pointed at. <span class="cmt_word">He was afflicted</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he abased himself</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>). The position of the emphatic pronoun (<span class="accented">hu</span>) <span class="accented">be</span>tween the first participle and the second detaches the second clause from the first and conjoins it with the third. Otherwise the rendering of the Authorized Version might stand. Translate, <span class="accented">He was oppressed</span>, <span class="accented">but he abased himself and opened not his mouth.</span> The silence of Jesus before his judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-62.htm">Matthew 26:62, 63</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-14.htm">Matthew 27:14</a>), when he could so easily have vindicated himself from every charge, was a self-abasement. It <span class="accented">seemed</span> like an admission of guilt. <span class="cmt_word">He opened not his mouth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-13.htm">Psalm 38:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-2.htm">Psalm 39:2, 9</a>). The contrast of the Servant's silence and passivity with men's ordinary vehemence of self-assertion under ill usage is most striking. Who was ever silent but he under such extremity of provocation? (For a contrast, see the account of the Jewish martyrdoms in 2 Macc. 7.) <span class="cmt_word">He is brought as a lamb</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as the lamb.</span> The Paschal lamb is, perhaps, intended, or, at any rate, the lamb of sacrifice. The prophet has often seen the dumb, innocent lamb led in silence to the altar, to be slain there, and thinks of that touching sight. It was probably the use of this imagery here which caused the Baptist to term our Lord "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a sheep before her shearers</span>. A second image, a reflex of the first, somewhat weaker, as so often in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24, 27, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ; also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.</body></html>
