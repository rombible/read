Having set forth at length the fact of the Servant's humiliation (vers. 2, 3), the prophet hastens to declare the reason of it. Twelve times over within the space of nine verses he asserts. with the most emphatic reiteration, that all the Servant's sufferings were vicarious, borne for him, to save him from the consequences of his sins, to enable him to escape punishment. The doctrine thus taught in the Old Testament is set forth! with equal distinctness in the New (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-50.htm">John 11:50-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, etc.), and forms the hope, the trust, and the consolation of Christians. and carried our sorrows. The application which St. Matthew makes of this passage to our Lord's miracles of healing (Matthew 8:17) is certainly not the primary sense of the words, but may be regarded as a secondary application of them. Christ's sufferings were the remedy for all the ills that flesh is heir to. <span class="cmt_word">Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God</span>. They who saw Christ suffer, instead of understanding that he was bearing the sins of others in a mediatorial capacity, imagined that he was suffering at God's hands for his own sins. Hence they scoffed at him and reviled him, even in his greatest agonies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>). To one only, and him not one of God's people, was it given to see the contrary, and to declare aloud, at the moment of the death, "Certainly this was a righteous Man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ; also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.</body></html>
