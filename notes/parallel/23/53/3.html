The intensity of His sympathy made Him feel the pain of others as His own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>), the "blood and water" from the pierced heart, the physical results of the agony in Gethsemane (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm" title="And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.">Luke 22:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>), indicate a nature subject to the conditions of our humanity.<p><span class= "bld">We hid as it were . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">As the hiding of the face from us, </span>or, <span class= "ital">on our part. </span>The words start from the picture of the leper covering his face from men, or their covering their own faces, that they might not look upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a>).

Men's contempt was shown, partly in the little attention which they paid to his teaching, partly in their treatment of him on the night and day before the Crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67, 68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-65.htm">Mark 14:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-18.htm">Mark 15:18, 19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Rejected of men</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">forsaken of men -</span> "one from whom men held themselves aloof" (Cheyne); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>. Our Lord had at no time more than a "little flock" attached to him. Of these, after a time, "many went back, and walked no more with him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>). Some, who believed on him, would only come to him by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). All the "rulers" and great men held aloof from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>). At the end, even his apostles "forsook him, and fled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A Man of sorrows</span>. The word translated "sorrows" means also pains of any kind. But the beautiful rendering of our version may well stand, since there are many places where the word used certainly means "sorrow" and nothing else (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-29.htm">2 Chronicles 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12, 18</a>, etc.).

The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore be retained. <span class="cmt_word">We hid as it were our faces from him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and there was as it were the hiding of the face from him.</span> Some suppose the hiding of God's face to be intended; but the context, which describes the treatment of the Servant by his fellow-men, makes the meaning given in our version far preferable. Men turned their faces from him when they met him, would not see him, would not recognize him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>).

But to this day few discern, or will acknowledge, that Divine power which goes with the word. The authentic and most important report of salvation for sinners, through the Son of God, is disregarded. The low condition he submitted to, and his appearance in the world, were not agreeable to the ideas the Jews had formed of the Messiah. It was expected that he should come in pomp; instead of that, he grew up as a plant, silently, and insensibly. He had nothing of the glory which one might have thought to meet with him. His whole life was not only humble as to outward condition, but also sorrowful. Being made sin for us, he underwent the sentence sin had exposed us to. Carnal hearts see nothing in the Lord Jesus to desire an interest in him. Alas! by how many is he still despised in his people, and rejected as to his doctrine and authority!</body></html>
