(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm" title="My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue sticks to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.">Psalm 22:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">When thou shalt make . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">if his soul shall make a trespass offering, he will see his seed; he will prolong his days </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> The sacrificial character of the death of the Servant is distinctly defined. It is a "trespass offering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-6.htm" title="And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest:">Leviticus 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-17.htm" title="It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.">Leviticus 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-12.htm" title="And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:">Leviticus 14:12</a>), an expiation for the sins of the people. The words declare that such a sacrifice was the condition of spiritual parentage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm" title="A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.">Psalm 22:30</a>), of the immortality of influence, of eternal life with God, of accomplishing the work which the Father had given him to do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-4.htm" title="I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.">John 17:4</a>). The "trespass offering" was, it must be remembered, distinct from the "sin offering," though both belonged to the same sacrificial group (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm" title="If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with your estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.">Leviticus 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-1.htm" title="Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.">Leviticus 7:1-7</a>), the distinctive element in the former being that the man who confessed his guilt, voluntary or involuntary, paid his shekels, according to the judgment of the priest, and offered a ram, the blood of which was sprinkled upon the altar. It involved, that is, the idea not of an atonement only, but of a satisfaction, according to the nature of the sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him</span> (see the comment on ver. 6, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). The sufferings of Christ, proceeding from the "determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), and being permitted by him; were in some sort his doing. It "pleased him," moreover, that they should be undergone, for he saw with satisfaction the Son's self-sacrifice, and he witnessed with joy man's redemption and deliverance effected thereby. He hath put him to grief; rather, <span class="accented">he dealt grievously -</span> a sort of <span class="accented">hend-adys.</span> "He bruised him with a grievous bruising." <span class="cmt_word">When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin</span>. It is proposed (Ewald, Cheyne), by the alteration of a letter, to make the passage run thus: "When <span class="accented">he</span> shall make his soul an offering," etc., and argued that "he who offers the Servant's life as a sacrifice must be the Servant himself, <span class="accented">and not</span> Jehovah" (Cheyne). No doubt the Servant did offer his own life (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>," He gave his soul a ransom for many"); but that fact does not preclude the possibility of the Father having also offered it. "Believest thou not," said our Lord to Philip, "that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>). This <span class="accented">perienchoresis</span>, as the ancient theologians called it, makes it possible to predicate of the Father almost all the actions which can be predicated of the Son - all, in fact, excepting those which belong to the Son's humanity, or which involve obedience and subordination. As the Father had "laid on Christ the iniquity of us all" (ver. 6), as he had "bruised him and put him to grief," so he might be said to have "made his soul an offering for sin." All was settled in the Divine counsels from all eternity, and when the ideal became the actual, God the Father wrought with God the Son to effectuate it. "Offerings for sin," or "guilt offerings," were distinct from "sin offerings." The object of the former was "satisfaction," of the latter "expiation." The Servant of Jehovah was, however, to be both. "As in ver. 5 the Divine Servant is represented as a Sin Offering, his death being an expiation, so here he is described as a Guilt Offering, his death being a satisfaction" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 151). <span class="cmt_word">He shall see his</span> <span class="cmt_word">seed</span>. The "seed" of a teacher of religion are his disciples. St. Paul speaks of Onesimus as one whom he had "begotten in his bends" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>). He calls himself by implication the "father" of his Corinthian converts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Both he and St. John address their disciples as "little children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 18, 25</a> I:3:7, 18 I:4:4 I:5:21). It had long previously been promised that "a seed should serve" Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>). Our Lord himself occasionally called his disciples his "children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm">John 21:5</a>). He has always "seen his seed" in his true followers. <span class="cmt_word">He shall prolong his days.</span> A seeming contradiction to the statement (ver. 8) that he should be "cut off" out of the land of the living; and the more surprising because his death is made the condition of this long life: "When thou shalt make his soul an offering [or, 'sacrifice'] for sin," then "he shall prolong his days." But the resurrection of Christ, and his entrance upon an immortal life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), after offering himself as a Sacrifice upon the cross, exactly meets the difficulty and solves the riddle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pleasure of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord shall prosper in his hand.</span> "In his hand" means "by his instrumentality." The "pleasure of the Lord" is God's ultimate aim and end with respect to his universe. This would "prosper" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be advanced, wrought out, rendered effectual - by the instrumentality of Christ. "Taking the verse as a whole, it sets forth <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the origin, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the nature, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the result of the Saviour's sufferings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Taking the last clause by itself, we have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Divine complacency in the purpose of human salvation; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the successful issue of that purpose as administered by the Messiah" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 153). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:10-12 Come, and see how Christ loved us! We could not put him in our stead, but he put himself. Thus he took away the sin of the world, by taking it on himself. He made himself subject to death, which to us is the wages of sin. Observe the graces and glories of his state of exaltation. Christ will not commit the care of his family to any other. God's purposes shall take effect. And whatever is undertaken according to God's pleasure shall prosper. He shall see it accomplished in the conversion and salvation of sinners. There are many whom Christ justifies, even as many as he gave his life a ransom for. By faith we are justified; thus God is most glorified, free grace most advanced, self most abased, and our happiness secured. We must know him, and believe in him, as one that bore our sins, and saved us from sinking under the load, by taking it upon himself. Sin and Satan, death and hell, the world and the flesh, are the strong foes he has vanquished. What God designed for the Redeemer he shall certainly possess. When he led captivity captive, he received gifts for men, that he might give gifts to men. While we survey the sufferings of the Son of God, let us remember our long catalogue of transgressions, and consider him as suffering under the load of our guilt. Here is laid a firm foundation for the trembling sinner to rest his soul upon. We are the purchase of his blood, and the monuments of his grace; for this he continually pleads and prevails, destroying the works of the devil.</body></html>
