It has to be noted, however, (1) that this requires an inversion of the clauses; (2) that it introduces a feature scarcely in harmony with the general drift of the description; (3) that the laws of parallelism require us to take the "rich" of one clause as corresponding to the "wicked" of the other, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in the sense of the wrongfully rich, the oppressors, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm" title="They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-16.htm" title="Be not you afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;">Psalm 49:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-3.htm" title="For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.">Psalm 73:3-5</a>. Men assigned to the Servant not the burial of a saint, with reverence and honour (such, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as that of Stephen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm" title="And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.">Acts 8:2</a>), but that of an unjust oppressor, for whom no man lamented, saying, "Ah lord! Ah my brother! Ah his glory!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>), and this <span class= "ital">although </span>(not "because") he had done no violence to deserve it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm" title="Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.">Job 16:17</a>.) The rendering "because" has been adopted as giving a reason for the honourable burial which, it has been assumed, the words imply. It may be questioned, however, when we remember Isaiah's words as to Shebna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm" title="What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that engraves an habitation for himself in a rock?">Isaiah 22:16</a>), whether he would have looked on such a burial as that recorded in the Gospels, clandestine, and with no public lamentation, as an adequate recognition of the holiness of the victim. The point of the last two clauses is that they declare emphatically the absolute rectitude of the sufferer in act, his absolute veracity in speech.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made his grave with the wicked</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they assigned him his grave with the wicked.</span> The verb is used impersonally. Those who condemned Christ to be crucified with two malefactors on the common execution-ground - "the place of a skull" - meant his grave to be "with the wicked," with whom it would naturally have been but for the interference of Joseph of Arimathaea. Crucified persons were buried with their crosses near the scene of their crucifixion by the Romans<span class="cmt_word">. And with the rich in his death</span>; or, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">he was</span>) <span class="accented">with a rich one after his death.</span> In the preceding clause, the word translated "the wicked" is plural, but in the present, the word translated "the rich" is singular. The expression translated "in his death" means "when he was dead," "after death" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-31.htm">1 Kings 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>). The words have a singularly exact fulfilment in the interment of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. The preposition used may mean either "because" or "although." The ambiguity is, perhaps, intentional. <span class="cmt_word">He had done no violence</span>; or, no <span class="accented">wrong</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-5.htm">Genesis 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-17.htm">1 Chronicles 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a> (margin); <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>). The LXX. give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> while St. Peter renders the word used by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>). The sinlessness of Christ is asserted by himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46</a>), and forms the main argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews for the superiority of the new covenant over the old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). It is also witnessed to by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>), by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), and by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>). As no other man was ever without sin, it follows that the Servant of the present chapter <span class="accented">must</span> be Jesus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ; also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in our stead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have come short of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their own evil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs and sorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.</body></html>
