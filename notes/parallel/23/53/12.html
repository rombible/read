Christ not only died for man, but, as it were, "poured out his soul" with his own hand to the last drop. The expression emphasizes the duration and the voluntariness of Messiah's sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">And he was numbered with the transgressors</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and he was reckoned with transgressors</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> where our Lord applies the words to himself). Christ was condemned as a "<span class="accented">blasphemer"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>), crucified with malefactors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-32.htm">Luke 23:32</a>), called "that deceiver" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>), and regarded generally by the Jews as accursed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he bare the sin of many;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and himself bare the sin of many</span> (compare the last clauses of vers. 6 and 11; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a><span class="cmt_word">).

But it has continued ever since, and will continue until the last day (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:10-12 Come, and see how Christ loved us! We could not put him in our stead, but he put himself. Thus he took away the sin of the world, by taking it on himself. He made himself subject to death, which to us is the wages of sin. Observe the graces and glories of his state of exaltation. Christ will not commit the care of his family to any other. God's purposes shall take effect. And whatever is undertaken according to God's pleasure shall prosper. He shall see it accomplished in the conversion and salvation of sinners. There are many whom Christ justifies, even as many as he gave his life a ransom for. By faith we are justified; thus God is most glorified, free grace most advanced, self most abased, and our happiness secured. We must know him, and believe in him, as one that bore our sins, and saved us from sinking under the load, by taking it upon himself. Sin and Satan, death and hell, the world and the flesh, are the strong foes he has vanquished. What God designed for the Redeemer he shall certainly possess. When he led captivity captive, he received gifts for men, that he might give gifts to men. While we survey the sufferings of the Son of God, let us remember our long catalogue of transgressions, and consider him as suffering under the load of our guilt. Here is laid a firm foundation for the trembling sinner to rest his soul upon. We are the purchase of his blood, and the monuments of his grace; for this he continually pleads and prevails, destroying the works of the devil.</body></html>
