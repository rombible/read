As Mr. Cheyne remarks, "All has been finished before the foundations of the world in the Divine counsels." Before him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "before Jehovah" - under the fostering care of Jehovah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40, 52</a>). God the Father had his eye ever fixed upon the Son with watchfulness and tenderness and love. <span class="cmt_word">As a tender plant</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a sapling</span>, or <span class="accented">as a sucker</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-16.htm">Job 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm">Job 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>). The "branch" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 10</a> - a different word - has nearly the same meaning. The Messiah will be a fresh sprout from the stump of a tree that has been felled; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the destroyed Davidic monarchy. As a root (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). The "sapling" from the house of David shall become the "root" out of which his Church will grow (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of a dry ground</span>. Either out of the "dry ground" of a corrupt age and nation, or out of the arid soil of humanity. In the East it is not unusual to see a tall succulent plant growing from a soft which seems utterly devoid of moisture. Such plants have roots that strike deep, and draw their nourishment from a hidden source. <span class="cmt_word">He hath no form nor comeliness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he had no form nor majesty.</span> It is scarcely the prophet's intention to describe the personal appearance of our Lord. What he means is that "the Servant" would have no splendid surroundings, no regal pomp nor splendour - nothing about him to attract men's eyes, or make them think him anything extraordinary. It is impossible to suppose that there was not in his appearance something of winning grace and quiet majesty. but it was of a kind that was not adapted to draw the gaze of the multitude. <span class="cmt_word">And when we shall see him</span>. Some connect this clause with the preceding, and translate, "He hath no form nor comeliness, that we should regard him; no beauty, that we should desire him" (Lowth, Vitringa, Gesenius, Ewald, Knobel, Henderson, Urwick. But Stier, Delitzsch, Kay, and Mr. Cheyne prefer the construction found in the Authorized Version). No beauty; literally, no <span class="accented">sightliness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nothing to attract the eye or arrest it. The spiritual beauties of holy and sweet expression and majestic calm could only have ben spiritually discerned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:1-3 No where in all the Old Testament is it so plainly and fully prophesied, that Christ ought to suffer, and then to enter into his glory, as in this chapter. But to this day few discern, or will acknowledge, that Divine power which goes with the word. The authentic and most important report of salvation for sinners, through the Son of God, is disregarded. The low condition he submitted to, and his appearance in the world, were not agreeable to the ideas the Jews had formed of the Messiah. It was expected that he should come in pomp; instead of that, he grew up as a plant, silently, and insensibly. He had nothing of the glory which one might have thought to meet with him. His whole life was not only humble as to outward condition, but also sorrowful. Being made sin for us, he underwent the sentence sin had exposed us to. Carnal hearts see nothing in the Lord Jesus to desire an interest in him. Alas! by how many is he still despised in his people, and rejected as to his doctrine and authority!</body></html>
