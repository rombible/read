It may be noted, as against the view that the verse points to the practices of the Babylonian exiles, that no reference to swine has been found in any cuneiform inscriptions. In Egypt, as in Palestine, it was looked upon as unclean (Herod. ii. 47, 48). On the worship of Thammuz, see an article by the Rev. A. H. Sayce, in the <span class= "ital">Contemporary Review </span>for September, 1883.<p><span class= "bld">Broth of abominable things.</span>--The words indicate, as before, a sacrificial feast of unclean meats, and therefore connected with a violation of the Mosaic law, possibly with some form of heathen mysteries or divination from the viscera of slaughtered animals.

Not in mere defiance of the Law, but in sacrificial meals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>) of which swine's flesh formed a part. Swine were sacrificial animals in Egypt (Herod., 2:47, 48), in Phoenicia (Lucian, 'De Dea Syra,' &sect; 54), and with the Greeks and Romans. They do not appear to have been employed for the purpose either by the Assyrians or the Babylonians. It was probably in Palestine that the Jews had eaten "swine's flesh," at sacrifices to Baal or Astarte (Ashtoreth). In later times to do so was regarded as one of the worst abominations (1 Macc. 1:41-64; 2 Macc, 6. and 7.). <span class="cmt_word">Broth of abominable things</span>. Either broth made from swine's flesh, or from the flesh of other unclean animals, as the hare and rabbit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-5.htm">Leviticus 11:5, 6</a>), or perhaps simply broth made from the flesh of any animals that had been offered to idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:1-7 The Gentiles came to seek God, and find him, because they were first sought and found of him. Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.</body></html>
