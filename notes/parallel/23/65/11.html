Ph?nician inscriptions have been found with the names Gad-Ashtoreth and Gad-Moloch. The "table" points to the <span class= "ital">lectisternium </span>(or "feast"), which was a prominent feature in Assyrian and other forms of polytheism.<p><span class= "bld">Unto that number.- </span>Here, again, we have in the proper name of a Syrian deity, probably of the planet Venus as the "lesser fortune." Some scholars have found a name <span class= "ital">Manu </span>in Babylonian inscriptions; and Manat, one of the three deities invoked by the Arabs in the time of Mahomet, is probably connected with<span class= "ital"> Meni the</span> it (Cheyne). See Sayce, as in Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm" title="Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;">Isaiah 65:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16.</span> - A MIXTURE OF THREATS WITH PROMISES. The prophet returns, in the main, to his former attitude, and resumes his denunciations (vers. 11, 12); but, with ver. 13, he begins to intermingle promises of favour to God's servants with threats against the rebellious, and finally (in ver. 16) turns wholly towards the side of grace and favour, announcing the coming of a time when "the former troubles" will be altogether "forgotten," and the kingdom of truth and right will be established. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye are they that forsake the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but as for you who forsake the</span> <span class="accented">Lord. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And forget my holy mountain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, literally, <span class="accented">forget</span> Zion. being absent from it so long (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a>), or, possibly, <span class="accented">neglect</span> Zion, though you might worship there if you pleased. <span class="cmt_word">That prepare a table for that troop</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that prepare a table for Gad.</span> There is ground for believing that "Gad" was a Phoenician deity, perhaps "the god of good fortune" (Cheyne), though this is not clearly ascertained; sometimes worshipped as an aspect of Baal, whence the name, Baal-Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a>); sometimes connected with other deities, as Moloch and Ashtoreth. The practice of "preparing tables" for the heathen gods was a common one, and appears in Herod., 1:181; in Baruch 6:30; in Bel and the Dragon, ver. 11; and in the Roman <span class="accented">lectisternia.</span> The tables prepared for the dead in Egyptian tombs were not very different, and implied a qualified worship of ancestors (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 423, 424; vol. 2 p. 39). And that furnish the drink offering unto that number; rather, <span class="accented">and that fill up mixed drink for M'ni.</span> M'ni appears, like Gad, to have been a Syrian deity, the name Ebed-M'ni, "servant of M'ni," occurring on Aramaeo-Persian coins of the Achaemenian period (Rodiger, in 'Addenda to Gesenius' Thesaurus,' p. 97). The word may be suspected to be cognate to the Arabic "Manat," a god recognized in the Koran as a mediator with Allah; but can scarcely have any connection with the Aryan names for the moon deity, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">Mena</span>, and the like. Its root is probably the Semitic <span class="accented">manah</span>, "to number" or" apportion," the word designating a deity who" apportions" men's fortunes to them (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:11-16 Here the different states of the godly and wicked, of the Jews who believed, and of those who persisted in unbelief, are set against one another. They prepared a table for that troop of deities which the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to that countless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them, which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignity of sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In every age and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, and despise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread of life, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake the Lord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness, and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in the abundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves in him. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the God of truth. And it was promised that in him should all the families of the earth be blessed. They shall think themselves happy in having him for their God, who made them forget their troubles.</body></html>
