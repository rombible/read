Most commentators say "Yes;" but there is, at least, an apparent absence of continuous sequence.

Taking the text as it stands, the most natural interpretation (there being no reference afterwards to the Gentiles) seems to be that Jehovah speaks to the same people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1-2</a>, and that both alike speak of indifference and hardness. On this view the words may be translated, <span class= "ital">I was ready to answer those who did not enquire, was nigh at hand to be discovered by those who did not seek<span class= "bld">. . .</span> .</span> Such words were a true description of the state of Israel, as they have been of Christian Churches since, and are in close agreement with what follows. On this view St. Paul's free use of the LXX. rendering must be looked on as analogous to the like application of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-1.htm" title="Say you to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.">Hosea 2:1</a>, by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25-26</a>) and by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm" title="Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.">1Peter 2:10</a>), though in these instances it is beyond question that the words primarily referred to the Jews, and not to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">A nation that was not called by my name.</span>--Better, with the LXX., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-22.htm" title="But you have not called on me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel.">Isaiah 43:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm" title="And there is none that calls on your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of you: for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities.">Isaiah 64:7</a>, <span class= "ital">that has not called on my name. </span>The meaning, on either rendering, is that Israel has sunk to the level of the heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - ISRAEL'S SUFFERINGS THE JUST MEED OF THEIR SINS. God's mercy is such that it even overflows upon those who are outside the covenant (ver. 1). It has been offered to Israel, but Israel has rejected it<span class="cmt_word">.</span> Their rebellion, their idolatries, and their pride have caused, and must continue to cause, their punishment (vers. 2-7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am sought</span>; rather, <span class="accented">inquired of</span>, or <span class="accented">consulted</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-3.htm">Ezekiel 20:3, 31</a>). The application of the text by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>) to the calling of the Gentiles will be felt by all believers in inspiration to preclude the interpretation which supposes Israel to be the subject of ver. 1 no less than of vers. 2-7. <span class="cmt_word">I said, Behold me</span>. This was the first step in the conversion of the Gentiles. God called them by his messengers, the apostles and evangelists. <span class="cmt_word">A nation that</span> <span class="cmt_word">was not called by thy Name</span> (so Gesenius, Delitzsch, Kay, and others). Bishop Lowth, Ewald, Diestel, and Mr. Cheyne, following the Septuagint and other ancient versions, render, "a nation that has not called upon thy Name." But this requires an alteration of the vowel-points, which seems unnecessary. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:1-7 The Gentiles came to seek God, and find him, because they were first sought and found of him. Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.</body></html>
