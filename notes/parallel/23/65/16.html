rather, <span class="accented">so that he who blesses himself.</span> The sequence of the argument is not altogether clear. Perhaps it is recant that God will call them <span class="accented">by his own Name</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>) - "the people of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>); and thence it will become natural for them to use no other name, either when they call for a blessing on themselves, or have to confirm a covenant with others. <span class="cmt_word">In the God of truth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the God of the Amen</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God who keeps covenant and promise, to which the strongest formula of consent was the word "Amen" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>, etc.). Similarly, St. John calls our Lord "the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because the former troubles are forgotten</span>. When the blessed time has come wherein men call themselves by the Name of the Lord, and know of only one God as the Source of blessing and the confirmation of an oath, then the former state of human affairs, with all its "troubles," will have passed away, and the new era will be inaugurated, which the prophet proceeds to describe at length (vers. 17-25). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:11-16 Here the different states of the godly and wicked, of the Jews who believed, and of those who persisted in unbelief, are set against one another. They prepared a table for that troop of deities which the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to that countless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them, which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignity of sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In every age and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, and despise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread of life, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake the Lord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness, and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in the abundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves in him. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the God of truth. And it was promised that in him should all the families of the earth be blessed. They shall think themselves happy in having him for their God, who made them forget their troubles.</body></html>
