In St. Paul's language, the "whole creation groaneth and travaileth together" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a>). In the new heaven and the new earth of the prophet's vision there would be no such discords. The flesh-eating beasts should change their nature; even the serpent, named, probably, with special reference to Genesis 3, as the starting-point of the discords, shall find food in the dust in which he crawls, and shall be no longer a destroyer. The condition of the ideal Paradise should be restored. The picture finds a parallel, perhaps a <span class= "ital">replica, </span>in Virgil, <span class= "ital">Eel. </span>4. Do the poet and the prophet stand on the same footing? or may we look for a literal fulfilment of the words of the one, though not of the other? The answer must be given in words that are "wary and few." We dare not, on the one hand, fix times and seasons, or press the <span class= "ital">letter </span>of prophetic visions as demanding a fulfilment. On the other, the permanence of Israel as a people suggests the possibility of a restored Jerusalem, and modern theories of evolution point to the gradual elimination of the fiercer animals as part of the conquests of humanity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wolf and the lamb shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">feed together</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>). The portraiture here is far less elaborate than in the earlier chapter, to which the present passage may be regarded as a refer-once. (For the sense in which the entire picture is to be understood, see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Dust shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">the serpent's meat.</span> Here we have a new feature, not contained in the earlier description. Serpents shall become harmless, anal instead of preying upon beasts, or birds, or reptiles, shall be content with the food assigned them in the primeval decree, "Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and <span class="accented">dust shalt thou eat</span> all the days of thy life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>). Mr. Cheyne appositely notes that "<span class="accented">much dust</span> is the food of the shades in the Assyrio-Babylonian Hades" (see the "Legend of Ishtar" in the 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 143, line 8). <span class="cmt_word">They shall not hurt nor destroy.</span> Repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>, word for word. In neither case should we regard the subject of the sentence as limited to the animals only. The meaning is that there shall be no violence of any kind, done either by man or beast, in the happy period described. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:17-25 In the grace and comfort believers have in and from Christ, we are to look for this new heaven and new earth. The former confusions, sins and miseries of the human race, shall be no more remembered or renewed. The approaching happy state of the church is described under a variety of images. He shall be thought to die in his youth, and for his sins, who only lives to the age of a hundred years. The event alone can determine what is meant; but it is plain that Christianity, if universal, would so do away violence and evil, as greatly to lengthen life. In those happy days, all God's people shall enjoy the fruit of their labours. Nor will children then be the trouble of their parents, or suffer trouble themselves. The evil dispositions of sinners shall be completely moritified; all shall live in harmony. Thus the church on earth shall be full of happiness, like heaven. This prophecy assures the servants of Christ, that the time approaches, wherein they shall be blessed with the undisturbed enjoyment of all that is needful for their happiness. As workers together with God, let us attend his ordinances, and obey his commands.</body></html>
