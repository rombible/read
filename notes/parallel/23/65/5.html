Here, however, the ground of the exclusiveness is not the consciousness of the peculiar privileges of Israel, but rests on what was an actual apostasy. Those of whom Isaiah speaks boasted of their initiation into heathen mysteries (Baal, Thammuz, or the like) as giving them a kind of consecrated character, and separating them from the <span class= "ital">profanum vulgus </span>of the Israelites, who were faithful to the God of their fathers.<p><span class= "bld">I am holier than thou.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I am holy to thee: i.e., one </span>whom thou mayest not approach. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-8.htm" title="You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread of your God: he shall be holy to you: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.">Leviticus 21:8</a>.) By some commentators the verb is taken as transitive, I <span class= "ital">make thee holy: i.e., </span>have power to impart holiness; but this is less satisfactory, both grammatically and as to meaning.<p><span class= "bld">These are a smoke in my nose . . .</span>--The point of the clause is that the punishment is represented as not future. The self-exalting idolaters are already as those who are being consumed in the fire of the Divine wrath, and their smoke is "a savour of death" in the nostrils of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stand by thyself</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "keep aloof - come not into contact with me; for mine is a higher holiness than thine, and I should be polluted by thy near approach." Initiation into heathen mysteries was thought to confer on the initiated a holiness unattainable otherwise. Thus the heathenized Jew claimed to be holier than the true servants of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">These are a smoke... a fire</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>, "There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it"). The heathenized Jews are fuel for the wrath of God, which kindles a fire wherein they burn continually (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:1-7 The Gentiles came to seek God, and find him, because they were first sought and found of him. Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.</body></html>
