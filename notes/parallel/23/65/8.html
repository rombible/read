Possibly, however, a link may be found in the "first" of the amended translation, which prepares the way for something that is to follow. God chastens, but does not destroy.<p><span class= "bld">Destroy it not . . .</span>--The thought is that as even one fruitful cluster of grapes will lead the vine-dresser to spare an otherwise fruitless vine in the hope of a fuller blessing in the future, so Jehovah will spare a sinful nation for the twenty or the ten righteous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/18-23.htm" title="And Abraham drew near, and said, Will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked?">Genesis 18:23-33</a>). The words "destroy it not" are those which stand at the head of Psalms 57-59, as indicating the tune to which they were to be sung; and it is a natural inference that it may have been a popular vintage song, and therefore doubly apt for the prophet's purpose. May we compare our own song of "Wood-man, spare that tree?" applied, as it has been, to the trees of ancient institutions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - SALVATION PROMISED TO A REMNANT. In Isaiah, and especially in the "Book of Consolation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.), promises are almost always intermingled with threatenings. The threats extend to the bulk of the nation; the promises are limited to "a remnant," since a remnant only could be brought to "seek" and serve God (ver. 10). Here the announcement that a remnant would be spared is introduced by a simile from men's treatment of their own vineyards (ver. 8). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the new wine is found in the cluster</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">when new wine is found in a grape-bunch</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as when even a single cluster of grapes is spied on a vine-stem, the vine-pruners say one to another, "Destroy not that stem, but spare it," so will God refrain from destroying those stocks in his vineyard, which give even a small promise of bearing good fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Destroy it not</span>. The words are thought to be those of a well-known vintage-song, which is perhaps alluded to in the heading (<span class="accented">Al-taschith</span>) prefixed to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57.htm">Psalm 57, 58</a>, and 59. "Each of these psalms was probably sung to the air of this favourite song" (Cheyne).

The Jews have been kept a distinct people, that all may witness the fulfilment of ancient prophecies and promises. God's chosen, the spiritual seed of praying Jacob, shall inherit his mountains of bliss and joy, and be carried safe to them through the vale of tears. All things are for the display of God's glory in the redemption of sinners.</body></html>
