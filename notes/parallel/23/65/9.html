Rather, a mere pleonasm, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>, etc. (see the comment on Isaiah 40:27). <span class="cmt_word">An inheritor</span> <span class="cmt_word">of my mountains</span>. The whole of Palestine is little more than a cluster of mountains. The cluster may be divided into three groups: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The mountains of Galilee, extending from Hermon to Tabor, separated from the next group by the plain of Esdraelon; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the mountains of Samaria and Judaea, extending from Carmel and Gilbea to the plateau of Mature above Hebron, which is 3600 feet above the sea; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the mountains of the trans-Jordanic region, including those of Bashan, Gilead, Moab, and Edom, separated from the two other groups by the Jordan valley. The highest elevation attained is that of Hermon (9400 feet); other minor heights are Jebel Jurmuk, in Galilee, 4000 feet; Safed, also in Galilee, 2775 feet; Ebal and Gerizim, in Samaria, 2700 feet; Sinjil, 2685; Neby Samwill, 2650; and the Mount of Olives, 2724 feet. The plateau of Mature reaches a height of 3600 feet. The only Palestinian plains are those of Esdraelon, Sharon, and the Ghor, or Jordan valley. Thus the land may well be spoken of as "my mountains." <span class="cmt_word">Mine elect</span> (comp. ch. 43:20; 45:4). The same expression is used of Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-13.htm">1 Chronicles 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-6.htm">Psalm 105:6, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-5.htm">Psalm 106:5</a>. God "chose" Israel out of all the nations of the earth to be his "peculiar people." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:8-10 In the bunch of unripe grapes, at present of no value, the new wine is contained. The Jews have been kept a distinct people, that all may witness the fulfilment of ancient prophecies and promises. God's chosen, the spiritual seed of praying Jacob, shall inherit his mountains of bliss and joy, and be carried safe to them through the vale of tears. All things are for the display of God's glory in the redemption of sinners.</body></html>
