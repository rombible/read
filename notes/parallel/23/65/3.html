The groves and "gardens" of Daphne, near Antioch. became famous in later times as the scene of idolatrous practices intimately bound up with the grossest and most shameless sensualism. We have few details of the ancient Syrian rites; but there is reason to believe that, wherever Astarte, the Dea Syra, was worshipped, whether at Daphne, or at Hierapolis, or at Balbek, or at Aphek, or at Damascus, or in Palestine, one and the same character of cult prevailed. The nature-goddess was viewed as best worshipped by rites into which sensualism entered as an essential element. Profligacy that cannot be described polluted the consecrated precincts, which were rendered attractive by all that was beautiful and delightful, whether in art or nature-by groves, gardens, statues, fountains, shrines, temples, music, processions, shows - and which were in consequence frequented both day and night by a multitude of votaries. <span class="cmt_word">And burneth incense upon altars of brick</span>; literally, upon the bricks. It is not clear that "altars" are intended. More probably the incense was burnt upon the tiled or bricked roofs of houses, where the Jews of Jeremiah's time "burned incense unto all the host of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-29.htm">Jeremiah 32:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). Brick altars are nowhere mentioned. The Assyrians and Babylonians made their altars of either stone or metal ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 36, 37; Herod., 1. 183). The Hebrews in early times had altars of earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The "altar of incense" in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-3</a>) was of wood plated with gold; that of burnt offering, of wood plated with bronze (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1, 2</a>). Solomon's altars were similar. Elijah on one occasion made an altar of twelve rough stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>). The Assyrians used polished stone, as did the Greeks and Romans. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:1-7 The Gentiles came to seek God, and find him, because they were first sought and found of him. Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.</body></html>
