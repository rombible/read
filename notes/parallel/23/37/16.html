Here, probably, the reference is to the glory-cloud which was the symbol of the Divine presence, and which rested, when it manifested itself, between the cherubim of the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-89.htm" title="And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking to him from off the mercy seat that was on the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.">Numbers 7:89</a>), those figures also symbolising the elemental forces of the heavens. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-33.htm" title="To him that rides on the heavens of heavens, which were of old; see, he does send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.">Psalm 68:33</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thou art the God, even thou alone.</span>--The absolute monotheism of the faith of Israel is placed in strong antithesis to the polytheism of Rabshakeh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?">Isaiah 37:12</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-11.htm" title="Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.">Jeremiah 10:11</a>, and Isaiah 40-42)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord... that dwellest between the cherubims</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that sittest upon the cherubim.</span> The allusion is scarcely to the poetic imagery of God riding on the cherubim in the heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>), as Mr. Cheyne suggests; but rather to his dwelling between the two cherubic forms in the holy of holies, and there manifesting himself (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-6.htm">1 Chronicles 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth</span>. It has been <span class="accented">questioned</span> whether Hezekiah was really as pronounced a monotheist as these expressions would imply, and suggested that his actual words received "a colouring" from a later writer. Hezekiah's contemporaries, it is said, Isaiah and Micah, make no such strong statements of their belief in one only God as this (Kuenen, Cheyne). But it is difficult to see what can be a clearer revelation of monotheism than <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>, or what truth more absolutely underlies the whole of Isaiah's teaching than the unity of the Supreme Being. The same under-current is observable in Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17, 18</a>). Sennacherib's belief, that each country has its own god (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>), is not shared by the religious Jews of his time. They are well aware that the heathen gods are "vanity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a>), "wind" and "confusion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>, etc.). Thou hast made heaven and earth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
