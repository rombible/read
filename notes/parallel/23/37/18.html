The gods of the nations had been cast into the fire (an alternative to their being taken as trophies for the temples of Asshur and Ishtar), but this could never happen to Jehovah, of whom there was no graven image, and He would show that He alone was ruler of the earth and of the heavens.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations</span>. This was a stubborn fact, which it was impossible to deny. From the time of Asshur-izir-pal at any rate, about <span class="date">B.C. 880</span>, Assyria had pursued for nearly two centuries a steady career of conquest, reducing the nations which were her neighbors, almost without exception, and gradually spreading her power from the tract immediately about Nineveh to the Persian Gulf on the south, the great plateau of Iran on the east, the Armenian Mountains (Niphates and Taurus) on the north, and on the west to Cilicia and the Mediterranean. Her progress towards the west alone is marked in Scripture, since there alone she came in contact with God's people. Under Pul (about <span class="date">B.C. 760</span>) she attacked Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>); under Tiglath-Pileser II. she carried off a portion of the ten tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>); under the same monarch she subjugated Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>); under Shalmaneser she besieged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>), and under Sargon took, Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>); under Sargon also she invaded Philistia and captured Ashdod (ch. 20:1). Now she was bent on subduing Judaea, and so preparing the way for the reduction of Egypt. Humanly speaking, it was most unlikely that the small and weak state of Judaea would be able to resist her. But God was all-powerful, and might be pleased to cast down, as he had been pleased to exalt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-19</a>). Hence Hezekiah's appeal. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
