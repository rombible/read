The expression, "virgin daughter," is used also by Isaiah of Zidon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>) and of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). The personification here is very effective. since it represents Jerusalem as a tender maiden, weak and delicate, yet still bold enough to stand up against Sennacherib and all his host, and bid him defiance. Confident in Jehovah, her Protector, she despises him, and laughs him to scorn; nay, "shakes her head at him," or rather. "after him," pursuing him with scornful gestures as In. retreats before her. (On shaking the head as a gesture of scorn, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-25.htm">Psalm 109:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
