He is described in Assurbanipal's inscriptions (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 60) as king of Mizr and Cush--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Egypt and Ethiopia. The policy of Hezekiah's counsellors had led them to court his alliance, as in Isaiah 30, 31. Now, however, the Egyptian army was at least mobilised. "Rahab" was no longer "sitting still" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm" title="For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.">Isaiah 30:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">When he heard it.</span>--The message is in substance a repetition of its predecessors, more defiant, perhaps, as if in answer to the threatened attack of Tirhakah's armies, which Sennacherib could scarcely fail to connect with Hezekiah's confident hope of deliverance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tirhakah, King of Ethopia</span>. Tirhakah is among the most famous of the monarchs belonging to this period. The Greeks called him "Tearchon," the Assyrians "Tarku" or "Tarqu." His name, as represented on his own monuments, is "Tahark" or "Tahrak." According to the Egyptian remains, he had a reign of at least twenty-six years in Egypt - from <span class="date">B.C. 693</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 667</span>. He would seem, however, to have been King of Ethiopia, and lord paramount of the lower valley of the Nile, from about <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, Shabatok for some years ruling Egypt, or a portion of it, as his deputy (Rawlinson, 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 450). Hezekiah's negotiations had, it is probable, been with Tirhakah (ch. 19:13; 20:5; 30:1-6). This monarch, having engaged to help him, now put his forces in motion, and began to descend the Nile valley to his relief. His movement rather provoked than alarmed Sennacherib, who, having defeated one Egyptian army in <span class="date">B.C. 701</span> ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, 134), was confident of success against another. <span class="cmt_word">He sent messengers</span>. It is not very clear what advantage Sennacherib expected from this second embassy. He had no fresh argument to bring forward, unless it were a suggestion that Hezekiah's God was endeavouring to deceive him. In the main, vers. 10-13 are a mere expansion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
