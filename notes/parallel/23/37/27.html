The comparison is one constantly used by the Hebrew psalmists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>), and was not unknown to the Assyrians ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 14). The delicate grass of spring in the East withers within a few weeks, and the fresh and tender herbage becomes yellow, parched, and sapless. The grass that springs upon the earthen roofs of houses fails even more rapidly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As corn blasted before it be grown up</span>; literally, <span class="accented">like a field before the stalk.</span> Our translators seem to have rightly preferred the reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-26.htm">2 Kings 19:26</a> (<span class="accented">sh'dephah</span>, equivalent to "blasting") to that of Isaiah (<span class="accented">sh'demah</span>, equivalent to "field") in this place. Their rendering brings out the true sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
