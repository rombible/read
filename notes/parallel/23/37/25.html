It was Sennacherib's special glory, as recorded in his inscriptions, that he had provided cities with water which were before scantily supplied, that he had made wells even in the deserts (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, i.</span> 29, 31, 9:23).<p><span class= "bld">All the rivers of the besieged places.</span>--As the words stand, they suggest the thought that the Assyrian army could cut off the supply of water as well as provide it, and so connect themselves with the Rabshakeh's taunt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm" title="But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?">Isaiah 36:12</a>. Their true meaning, however, is probably, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm" title="And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defense shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.">Isaiah 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-12.htm" title="In that day also he shall come even to you from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.">Micah 7:12</a>, "the rivers or <span class= "ital">canals </span>of Egypt," a form being used for Egypt which also conveys the idea of "besieged fortresses." So taken, the words are a defiant threat against Tirhakah. Not all the branches of the Nile in the Delta should protect his cities. His armies would, as it were, dry them up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have digged, and drunk water</span>. Sennacherib notes three natural obstacles to his advance - the forces of his opponents he does not appear to account an obstacle - viz. mountains, deserts, rivers. Mountains do not stop him - he crosses them even with his chariot-force (ver. 24). Deserts do not stop him - he digs wells there, and drinks their waters. Rivers will not stop him - he will dry them up, trample them into puddles. Note the contrast between the past tenses, "I have come up," "I have digged," "I have drunk," and the future, "I will dry up." He had crossed the mountain ranges Sinjar, Amanus, Lebanon; he had passed waterless tracts, where he had had to dig wells, in Mesopotamia and Northern Syria. He was about to find his chief obstacle, rivers, when he invaded Lower Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">The rivers of the besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the rivers of Egypt. Mazor</span>, the singular form (compare Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and modern Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span>), is used here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>, and perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>), instead of the ordinary dual term, <span class="accented">Miz-raim</span>, probably because Lower Egypt is especially intended. Sennacherib was looking especially to the invasion of Lower Egypt,where the Nile had "seven branches" (Herod., 2:17), and the country was also cut up by numerous canals, which would naturally constitute a great difficulty to a force depending mainly on its chariots. He believed, however, in his heart, that he would find a way of "drying up" these "rivers." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
