It was then autumn, probably near the equinox, which was the beginning of a new year. The Assyrian invasion had stopped all tillage in the previous spring, and the people had to rely upon the spontaneous products of the fields. In the year that was about to open they would be still compelled to draw from the same source, but in twelve months' time the land would be clear of the invaders, and agriculture would resume its normal course, and the fulfilment of this prediction within the appointed limit of time would guarantee that of the wider promise that follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This shall be a sign unto thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the sign.</span> The prophet now turns to Hezekiah, and makes an address to him. "This," he says, "shall be the sign unto thee of Sennachcrib's being effectually 'bridled,' and the danger from Assyria over. In the third year from the present the land shall have returned to its normal condition, and you shall enjoy its fruits as formerly. Meanwhile you shall obtain sufficient nourishment from the grain which has sown itself." The "third year," according to Hebrew reckoning, might be little more than one year from the date of the delivery of the prophecy. The entire withdrawal of all the Assyrian garrisons from the country, which no doubt followed on Sennacherib's retreat, might well have occupied the greater part of a year. Till they were withdrawn, the Jews could not venture to till their territory. <span class="cmt_word">Plant vineyards</span>. The Assyrians had, no doubt, cut down the vines (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 62, 79; vol. 7. p. 43, etc.; Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pl. 40). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
