The step would seem to indicate a strategic movement, intended to check the march of Tirhakah's army; but in our ignorance of the topography, we can settle nothing further. By some writers Libnah has been identified with Pelusium, or some other town in the Delta of the Nile. The narrative seems, perhaps, to suggest something more than a transfer of the attack from one small fortress in Judah to another; but that is all that can be said.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rabshakeh... found the King of Assyria warring against Libnah.</span> Libnah was a town at no great distance from Lachish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-31.htm">Joshua 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39-42</a>). It was also near Mareshah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42-44</a>), and must therefore have belonged to the more southern portion of the Shefeleh, and probably to the eastern region, where the hills sink down into the plain. The exact site is very uncertain, and still remains to be discovered. Sennacherib's object in moving upon Libnah is doubtful; but it would seem, from his monuments, that he had captured Lachish (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152), and had gone on to Libnah, as the next stronghold on the way to Egypt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
