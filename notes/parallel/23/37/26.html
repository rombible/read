The adverb "long ago" should be connected with the words that follow. The events of history had all been foreseen and ordered, as in the remote past, by the counsels of Jehovah. Kings and armies were but as His puppets in the drama of the world's history. The words "hast thou not heard" suggest the thought that Isaiah assumes that Sennacherib had heard of his prophecies, or those of his fore-runners, as to the purposes of Jehovah--an assumption which, looking to the fact that he had ministers who were well acquainted with Hebrew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm" title="But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?">Isaiah 36:12</a>), was in itself probable enough.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou not heard, etc.?</span> An abrupt transition, such as is common in Isaiah. From speaking in the person of Sennacherib, the prophet without warning breaks off, and returns to speaking in the person of Jehovah, as his mouthpiece. "Hast thou not heard," he says, long ago; or rather, "<span class="accented">that from</span> long ago! have done this?" Art thou so ignorant, so devoid of that light of nature, which should "lighten every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>), as not to know God's method of governing the world? How that "from long ago," in his eternal counsels, he designs the rise and fall of nations, and the mode in which their destruction is to be brought about? Art thou not aware that conquerors are mere instruments in God's hands - "the rods of his anger" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>) - to work his will, and then to have his will worked upon them in turn (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6-19</a>)? Sennacherib seems to be really reproached for not knowing what he ought to have known, and might have known, if he had listened to the voice of conscience and reason. <span class="cmt_word">Now have brought it to pass</span>, etc. All that Sennacherib had done, he had done as God's instrument, by his permission - nay, by his aid. He had been the axe in the hand of the hewer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>), the saw, the rod, the staff, of God's indignation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>), the executor of his vengeance. The very purpose of his being was that he should "lay waste (certain) defenced cities into ruinous heaps." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
