The position of Gozan is defined by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a> as being on the Habor, or <span class= "ital">Khab-r, </span>which flows into the Tigris from the east, above Mosul. Haran is probably identical with Abraham's resting-place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>), and the Charran of Josephus and St. Stephen's speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm" title="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.">Acts 7:4</a>). "Rezeph" is identified with the Rhesepher of Ptolemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm" title="Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.">Isaiah 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm" title="And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dig; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.">Isaiah 5:6</a>) below Thapeacus, between the 'Euphrates and Tadmor (= Palmyra). Telassar is probably an altered form of Tel-Assur (the hill of Assur), and was probably a new name given to a conquered city, after the manner in which Shalmaneser records that he gave names to cities that he had taken belonging to Akhuni, the son of Adini (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iii.</span> 87, v. 30). In the patronymic we may trace <span class= "ital">the sons of Eden </span>of this verse. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm" title="I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.">Amos 1:5</a> we have a Beth-Eden named as connected with Damascus; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-23.htm" title="Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:23</a> an "Eden" connected with Haran and Asshur, as carrying on traffic with Tyre. The latter is probably identical with that named by Sennacherib.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My fathers</span>. The Assyrian monarchs call all those who have preceded them upon the throne their "fathers," without intending to claim any blood-relation-ship. Sargon, Sennacherib's father, though a usurper and the first king of a new dynasty, frequently speaks of "the kings his fathers" ('Records of the Past,' ch. 7. pp. 39, 51, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Gozan... Haran ... Rezeph... Telassar</span>. "Gozan" is, beyond all doubt, the region known to the Greeks as Gauzanitis, which was the eastern portion of Upper Mesopotamia, or the country about the sources of the Khabour river. The <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> conquest of this tract is indicated by the settlement of the Israelites in the region (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). "Harsh" is the well-known "city of Nahor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>), called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a> "<span class="accented">Charran</span>," and by the Greeks and Romans, Carrhae. It has now recovered its old designation, and is known as <span class="accented">Hurrah.</span> "Rezeph" was in the neighborhood of Haran, and is mentioned as belonging to Assyria as early as <span class="date">B.C. 775</span> ('Eponym Canon,' p. 82). It had probably revolted and been reduced at a later date. "Telassar," "the Hill of <span class="accented">Asshur</span>," is not mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, but was probably the Assyrian name of a town on or near the Euphrates, in the country of the Bent-Eden, which was not far from Carche-mish (see 'Records of the Past,' ch. 3. pp. 90-92). <span class="cmt_word">The children of Eden</span>. The Assyrian inscriptions mention a "Bit-Adini" (comp. <span class="accented">Amos</span> 1:5), and a chief who is called "the son of Adini;" both belonging to the Middle Euphrates region. The "children of Eden" (Beni-Eden) were probably the people of the tract about Bit-Adini. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:1-38 This chapter is the same as 2Ki 19</body></html>
