Its chief characteristic is that it presents the condition of the conquered nation as distinct from that of the conqueror. The opening words declare that the long-delayed judgment is at last coming, swift as a cloud driven by the storm-wind, upon the idols of Egypt. Men shall feel that the presence of the Mighty One is among them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - THE BURDEN OF EGYPT. It has been doubted whether this prophecy refers to the conquest of Egypt by Piankhi, as related in the monument which he set up at Napata, or to that by Esarhaddon, of which we gain our knowledge from the inscriptions of his son, Asshur-bani-pal. In the former case, we must suppose it written as early as <span class="date">B.C. 735</span>; in the latter, its date might be as late as <span class="date">B.C. 690</span>. The division of Egypt, "kingdom against kingdom," is a circumstance rather in favor of the earlier date; but the "cruel lord," and the mention of the "princes of Zoan and Noph," are decisive for the later. Piankhi is anything rather than a "cruel lord," being particularly mild and clement; Napata (Noph) is under him, and cannot be said to have been "deceived" or to have "seduced Egypt;" and Zoan plays no part in the history of the period. Esarhaddon, on the contrary, was decidedly a "cruel" prince, and treated Egypt with great severity, splitting it up into a number of governments. Zoan was one of the leading cities of the time, and Noph was the leading power on the Egyptian side, the head of the patriotic party which resisted the Assyrian monarch, but to no purpose. We may, therefore, regard this prophecy as one of Isaiah's latest, placed where it is merely on account of its head-tug - the compiler having placed all the "burdens" against foreign countries together. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord rideth upon a swift cloud</span>. Natural imagery to express the rapidity of Divine visitations (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>). God, being about to visit Egypt with a judgment of extreme severity, is represented as entering the land in person (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The idols of Egypt shall be moved.</span> Neither Piankhi nor any other Ethiopian conqueror made war on the Egyptian idols; but the Assyrians were always bent on humbling the gods of the hostile countries (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>). We have no detailed account of Esarhaddon's campaign; but we find Asshur-bani-pal's first victory over Tirhakah immediately followed by the presentation to him in his camp of Egyptian deities (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 20, 1. 1), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of their images. These were probably taken to Nineveh, or else destroyed. At a later date, the same monarch deprived an Egyptian temple of two of its sacred obelisks (ibid., p. 54, 11. 4, 5). The heart of Egypt shall molt (coup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-17 God shall come into Egypt with his judgments. He will raise up the causes of their destruction from among themselves. When ungodly men escape danger, they are apt to think themselves secure; but evil pursues sinners, and will speedily overtake them, except they repent. The Egyptians will be given over into the hand of one who shall rule them with rigour, as was shortly after fulfilled. The Egyptians were renowned for wisdom and science; yet the Lord would give them up to their own perverse schemes, and to quarrel, till their land would be brought by their contests to become an object of contempt and pity. He renders sinners afraid of those whom they have despised and oppressed; and the Lord of hosts will make the workers of iniquity a terror to themselves, and to each other; and every object around a terror to them.</body></html>
