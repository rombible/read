Here it would seem to be used for Lower Egypt, the region of Zoan and Memphis, as distinct from Upper Egypt or the Thebaid. The same form occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-25.htm" title="I have dig, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.">Isaiah 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm" title="I have dig and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.">2Kings 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-12.htm" title="In that day also he shall come even to you from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.">Micah 7:12</a>. Its primary meaning is that of a fortified land. The "flags" are strictly the papyrus of the Nile; the "brooks" are the <span class= "ital">canals </span>or Nile-branches of the Delta.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall turn the rivers far away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the rivers shall stagnate</span> (Cheyne). Probably the canals are intended, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a> (see 'Pulpit Commentary,' <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The brooks of defense shall be emptied</span>. Some render this "brooks of Egypt," regarding <span class="accented">matsor</span> as here used for "Mitsraim;" but our translation is more forcible, and may well stand. The "brooks of defense" are those which had hitherto formed the moats round walled cities (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-25.htm">Isaiah 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The reeds and flags shall wither</span>. Reeds, flags, rushes, and water-plants of all kinds abound in the backwaters of the Nile, and the numerous ponds and marshes connected with its overflow (see the 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus 2:3, p. 24). These forms of vegetation would be the first to wither on the occurrence of a deficient inundation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-17 God shall come into Egypt with his judgments. He will raise up the causes of their destruction from among themselves. When ungodly men escape danger, they are apt to think themselves secure; but evil pursues sinners, and will speedily overtake them, except they repent. The Egyptians will be given over into the hand of one who shall rule them with rigour, as was shortly after fulfilled. The Egyptians were renowned for wisdom and science; yet the Lord would give them up to their own perverse schemes, and to quarrel, till their land would be brought by their contests to become an object of contempt and pity. He renders sinners afraid of those whom they have despised and oppressed; and the Lord of hosts will make the workers of iniquity a terror to themselves, and to each other; and every object around a terror to them.</body></html>
