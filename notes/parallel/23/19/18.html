The "five cities" stand either as a certain number for an uncertain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-17.htm" title="One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall you flee: till you be left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.">Isaiah 30:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm" title="Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, said the LORD God of Israel.">Isaiah 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-8.htm" title="And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.">Leviticus 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-19.htm" title="Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.">1Corinthians 14:19</a>), or possibly as the actual number of the chief or royal cities of Egypt. The "language of Canaan" is Hebrew, and the prediction is that this will become the speech of the worshippers of Jehovah in the Egyptian cities. There is to be one universal speech for the universal Church of the true Israel.<p><span class= "bld">And swear to the Lord of hosts.</span>--The oath, as in the parallel phrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a>, is one of allegiance, and implies, therefore, something like a covenant of obedience.<p><span class= "bld">The city of destruction.</span>--There is probably something like a play on the name of the Egyptian city On, the Greek Heliopolis, the City of the Sun (Heb., <span class= "ital">Ir-ha-kheres</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the word which the prophet actually uses (<span class= "ital">Ir-ha-cheres</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the "city of destruction." The paronomasia, like in character to Ezekiel's transformation of On into Aven, "nothingness," or "vanity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-17.htm" title="The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.">Ezekiel 30:17</a>), or Hosea's of Beth-el ("house of God") into Bethaven (" house of nothingness") (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a>), was intended to indicate the future demolition of the sun-idols, and is so interpreted in the Targum on this passage, "Bethshemesh (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Heliopolis), whose future fate shall be destruction." The word for destruction is cognate with the verb used of Gideon's breaking down the image of Baal, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:">Judges 6:25</a>; and in Jeremiah's prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-13.htm" title="He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.">Jeremiah 43:13</a>), "He shall break the pillars in the house of the sun," we may probably trace an allusive reference to Isaiah's language. Other meanings, such as "city of rescue," "city of protection," "city of restoration," have been suggested, but on inadequate grounds. The Vulg. gives <span class= "ital">civitas solis. </span>The LXX. rendering, "city <span class= "ital">asedek," </span>apparently following a different reading of the Hebrew, and giving the meaning, "city of righteousness," was probably connected historically with the erection of a Jewish temple at Leon-topolis by Onias IV., in the time of Ptolemy Philometor, which for some two centuries shared with the Temple at Jerusalem the homage of Egyptian Jews. Onias and his followers pointed to Isaiah's words as giving a sanction to what their brethren in Palestine looked on as a rival and sacrilegious worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-22.</span> - THE TURNING OF EGYPT TO JEHOVAH. The chastisement of the Egyptians shall be followed, after a while, by a great change. Influences from Canaan shall penetrate Egypt (ver. 18), an altar shall be raised in her midst to Jehovah (ver. 19), and she herself shall cry to him for succor (ver. 20) and be delivered (ver. 20). Egypt shall even become a part of Jehovah's kingdom, shall "know him," and serve him with sacrifice and oblation (ver. 21), and perform her vows to Jehovah, and have her supplications heard by him, and be converted and healed (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. Not really the day of vengeance, but that which, in the prophet's mind, is most closely connected with it - the day of restitution - whereof he has spoken perpetually (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>, etc.). The two are parts of one scheme of things, and belong in the prophet's mind to one time. <span class="cmt_word">Shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan</span>. It is quite true, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, that the Eastern Delta was from a very early date continually more and more Semitized by an influx of settlers from Palestine, and that Egyptian literature bears strong marks of this linguistic influence. But this is scarcely what the prophet intends to speak about. He is not interested in philology. What he means is that there will be an appreciable influx into Egypt of Palestinian ideas, thoughts, and sentiments. "Five" is probably used as a "round" number. The first manifest fulfillment of the prophecy was at the foundation of Alexandria, when the Jews were encouraged to become settlers by the concession of important privileges (Josephus, 'Contr. Ap.,' 2:4), and where they ultimately became the predominant element in the population, amounting, according to Philo ('In Flaec.,' &sect; 6), to nearly a million souls. The next great Palestinian influx was under Ptolemy YI. (Philometor), when Onias fled from Palestine with a number of his partisans, and obtained permission to erect a Jewish temple near Heliopelis. The site of this temple is probably marked by the ruins at Tel-el-Yahoudeh ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for July, 1880, pp. 137-139). It seems to have been a center to a number of Jewish communities in the neighborhood. In this double way Jehovah became known to Egypt before Christianity. A Christian Church was early established in Alexandria, possibly by St. Mark. <span class="cmt_word">Swear to the Lord of hosts</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "swear fidelity to him." <span class="cmt_word">One shall be called, The city of destruction</span>. Some manuscripts read '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-Kheres</span>, "City of the Sun," for '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-heres</span>, "City of Destruction," in which case the reference would be plainly to Heliopelis, which was in the immediate neighborhood of Tel-el-Yahoudeh, and which in the Ptolemaic period may well have fallen under Jewish influence. Even <span class="accented">if </span> '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-heres</span> stand as the true reading, the name may still have been given with allusion to Heliopolis, the prophet intending to say, "That city which was known as the City of the Sun-God shall become known as the City of Destruction of the Sun-God and of idolatrous worship generally." That Heliopolis did actually fall under Jewish influence in the Ptolemaic period appears from a remarkable passage of Polyhistor, who says of the Exodus and the passage of the Red Sea, "The Memphites say that Moses, being well acquainted with the district, watched the ebb of the tide, and so led the people across the dry bed of the sea; but <span class="accented">they of Heliopolis</span> affirm that the king, at the head of a vast force, and having the sacred animals also with him, pursued after the Jews, because they were carrying away with them the riches which they had borrowed from the Egyptians. Then, "<span class="accented">they say</span>," the voice of God commanded Moses to smite the sea with his rod, and divide it; and Moses, when he heard, touched the water with it, and so the sea parted asunder, and the host marched through on dry ground." Such an account of the Exodus would scarcely have been given by Egyptians unless they were three parts Hebraized. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/isaiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:18-25 The words, In that day, do not always refer to the passage just before. At a time which was to come, the Egyptians shall speak the holy language, the Scripture language; not only understand it, but use it. Converting grace, by changing the heart, changes the language; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. So many Jews shall come to Egypt, that they shall soon fill five cities. Where the sun was worshipped, a place infamous for idolatry, even there shall be a wonderful reformation. Christ, the great Altar, who sanctifies every gift, shall be owned, and the gospel sacrifices of prayer and praise shall be offered up. Let the broken-hearted and afflicted, whom the Lord has wounded, and thus taught to return to, and call upon him, take courage; for He will heal their souls, and turn their sorrowing supplications into joyful praises. The Gentile nations shall not only unite with each other in the gospel fold under Christ, the great Shepherd, but they shall all be united with the Jews. They shall be owned together by him; they shall all share in one and the same blessing. Meeting at the same throne of grace, and serving with each other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes, and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.</body></html>
