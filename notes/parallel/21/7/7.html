This verse therefore cannot introduce a new subject, but must be connected with what has gone before. But it is so hard to do this satisfactorily, that Delitzsch conjectures that a line may have dropped out, and that this verse may have begun with "Better: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>"Better is a little with righteousness, &c," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm" title="Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.">Proverbs 16:8</a>. If this be thought too strong a remedy, we may explain the connection, that by listening to faithful rebuke rather than to the flattery of fools, a ruler may be checked in a course of oppression or corruption which threatens to undermine his understanding. As we understand the passage, he becomes mad who commits, not who suffers, the oppression.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The verse begins with <span class="accented">ki</span>, which usually introduces a reason for what has preceded; but the difficulty in finding the connection has led to various explanations and evasions. The Authorized Version boldly separates the verse from what has gone before, and makes a new paragraph beginning with "surely:" <span class="cmt_word">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad.</span> Delitzsch supposes that something has been lost between vers. 6 and 7, and he supplies the gap by a clause borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>, "Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right;" and then the sentence proceeds naturally, "For oppression," etc. But this is scarcely satisfactory, as it is mere conjecture wholly unsupported by external evidence. The Vulgate leaves <span class="accented">ki</span> untranslated; the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. Looking at the various paragraphs, all beginning with <span class="accented">rob</span>, rendered "better," viz. vers. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, we must regard the present verse as connected with what precedes, a new subject being introduced at ver. 8. Putting ver. 6 in a parenthesis as merely presenting an illustration of the talk of fools, we may see in ver. 7 a confirmation of the first part of ver. 5. The rebuke of the wise is useful even in the case of rulers who are tempted -to excess and injustice. The "oppression" in the text is the exercise of irresponsible power, that which a man inflicts, not what he suffers; this makes him "mad," even though he be in other respects and under other circumstances wise; he ceases to be directed by reason and principle, and needs the correction of faithful rebuke. The Septuagint and Vulgate, rendering respectively <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="accented">calumnia</span>, imply that the evil which distracts the wise man is false accusation. <span class="cmt_word">And a gift destroyeth the heart.</span> The admission of bribery is likewise an evil that calls for wise rebuke. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>, "He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live." The phrase, "destroys the heart," means corrupts the understanding, <span class="accented">deprives</span> a man of wisdom, makes him no better than a fool (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>, where the same effect is attributed to whoredom and drunkenness). The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "destroys the heart of his nobility;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">perdet robur cordis illius</span>, "will destroy the strength of his heart." The interpretation given above seems to be the most reasonable way of dealing with the existing text; but Nowack and Volck adopt Delitzsch's emendation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:7-10 The event of our trials and difficulties is often better than at first we thought. Surely it is better to be patient in spirit, than to be proud and hasty. Be not soon angry, nor quick in resenting an affront. Be not long angry; though anger may come into the bosom of a wise man, it passes through it as a way-faring man; it dwells only in the bosom of fools. It is folly to cry out upon the badness of our times, when we have more reason to cry out for the badness of our own hearts; and even in these times we enjoy many mercies. It is folly to cry up the goodness of former times; as if former ages had not the like things to complain of that we have: this arises from discontent, and aptness to quarrel with God himself.</body></html>
