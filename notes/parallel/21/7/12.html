Symmachus has, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Wisdom shelters as money shelters." The Vulgate explains the obscure text by paraphrasing, <span class="accented">Sieur enirn protegit sapientia</span>, sic <span class="accented">protegit petunia</span>. Shadow, in Oriental phrase, is equivalent to protection (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-5.htm">Psalm 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a>). Wisdom as well as money is a shield and defense to men. As it is said in one passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-8.htm">Proverbs 13:8</a>) that riches are the ransom of a man's life, so in another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:15</a>) we are told how wisdom delivered a city from destruction. The literal translation given above implies that he who has wisdom and he who has money rest under a safe protection, are secure from material evil. In this respect they are alike, and have analogous claims to man's regard. <span class="cmt_word">But the excellency</span> - profit, or advantage - <span class="cmt_word">of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it</span>. "Knowledge" (<span class="accented">daath</span>) and "wisdom" (<span class="accented">chokmah</span>) are practically here identical, the terms being varied for the sake of poetic parallelism. The Revised Version, following Delitzsch and others, renders, <span class="accented">Wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. secures him from passions and excesses which tend to shorten life. This seems to be scarcely an adequate ground for the noteworthy advantage which wisdom is said to possess. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> "And the excellence of the knowledge of wisdom will quicken him that hath it." Something more than the mere animal life is signified, a climax to the "defense" mentioned in the preceding clause - the higher, spiritual life which man has from God. Wisdom in the highest sense, that is, practical piety and religion, is "a tree of life to them that lay hold of her, and happy is every one that retaineth her" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), where it is implied that wisdom restores to man the gift which he lost at the Fall (camp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>). The Septuagint expression <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> recalls the words of Christ, "As the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom he will;" "It is the Spirit that quickeneth (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). Koheleth attributes that power to wisdom which the more definite teaching of Christianity assigns to the influence of the Holy Spirit. Some would explain, "fortifies or vivifies the heart," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. imparts new life and strength to meet every fortune. The Vulgate rendering is far astray from the text, and does not accurately convey the sense of the passage, running thus: <span class="accented">Hoe autem plus habet eruditio et sapientia</span>: <span class="accented">quod vitam tribuunt possessori sue</span>, "But this more have learning and wisdom, that they give life to the possessor of them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.</body></html>
