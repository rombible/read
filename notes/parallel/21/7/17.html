But the present verse cannot be meant, as at first sight it seems to do, to sanction a certain amount of wickedness provided it does not exceed due measure. To surmount this difficulty some have undeavored to modify the term "wicked" (<span class="accented">rasha</span>), taking it to mean "engaged in worldly matters," or "not subject to rule," "lax," or again "restless," as some translate the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>. But the word seems not to be used in any such senses, and bears uniformly the uncompromising signification assigned to it, "to be wicked, unrighteous, guilty." The difficulty is not overcome by Plumptre's suggestion of the introduction of a little "playful irony learned from Greek teachers," as if Koheleth meant, "I have warned you, my friends, against over-righteousness, but do not jump at the conclusion that license is allowable. That was very far from my meaning." The connection of thought is this: in the previous verse Koheleth had denounced the Pharisaical spirit which virtually condemned the Divine ordering of circumstances, because vice was not at once and visibly punished, and virtue at once rewarded; and now he proceeds to warn against the deliberate and abominable wickedness which infers from God's long-suffering his absolute neglect and non- interference in mortal matters, and on this view plunges audaciously into vice and immorality, saying to itself, "God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>). Such conduct may well be called "foolish;" it is that of "the fool who says in his heart, There is no God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). The actual wording of the injunction sounds to us somewhat strange; but its form is determined by the requirements of parallelism, and the aphorism must not be pressed beyond its general intention, "Be not righteous nor wise to excess; be not wicked nor foolish to excess." Septuagint, "Be not very wicked, and be not stubborn (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>)." Why shouldest thou die before thy time? literally, <span class="accented">not in thy time</span>; prematurely, tempting God to punish thee by retributive judgment, or shortening thy days by vicious excesses. (For the former, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31, 33</a>; and for the latter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-21.htm">Proverbs 10:21</a>.) The Syriac contains a clause not given in any other version, "that thou mayest not be hated." As is often the case, both in this book and in Proverbs, a general statement in one place <span class="accented">is reduced</span> by a contrariant or modified opinion in another. Thus the prolongation of the life of the wicked, noticed in ver. 15, is here shown to be abnormal, impiety in the usual course of events having a tendency to shorten life. In this way hasty generalization is corrected, and the Divine arrangement is vindicated. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.</body></html>
