Here is another reason against murmuring and hasty judgment. True wisdom is shown by submission to the inevitable. In all that happens one ought to recognize God's work and God's ordering, and man's impotence. <span class="cmt_word">For who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</span> The things which God hath made crooked are the anomalies, the crosses, the difficulties, which meet us in life. Some would include bodily deformities, which seems to be a piece of unnecessary literalism. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; "Who will be able to straighten him whom God has distorted?" and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nemo possit corrigere quem ille despexerit</span>, "No one can amend him whom he hath despised." The thought goes back to what was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>, "That which is crooked cannot be made straight;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>, man "cannot contend with him that is mightier than he." "As for the wondrous works of the Lord," says Ben-Sirs," there may be nothing taken from them, neither may anything be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out" (Ecclus. 18:6). We cannot arrange events according to our wishes or expectations; therefore not only is placid acquiescence a necessary duty, but the wise man will endeavor to accommodate himself to existing circumstances <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.</body></html>
