The moderation enjoined is the only true wisdom, which, indeed, is the most powerful incentive and support. "Wisdom proves itself stronger" (as the verb is put intransitively) "<span class="accented">to</span> the wise <span class="accented">man</span>." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>," will help;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">confortuvit</span>, "hath strengthened." The spiritual and moral force of <span class="accented">the</span> wisdom grounded upon the fear of God is here signified, and is all the more insisted upon to counteract any erroneous impression conveyed by the caution against over-wisdom in ver. 16 (see note on ver. 17, at the end). <span class="cmt_word">More than ten mighty men which are in the city.</span> The number <span class="accented">ten indicates completeness</span>, <span class="accented">containing in it</span>self the whole arithmetical system, and used representatively for an indefinite multitude. Thus Job (Job 19:3) complains that his friends have reproached him ten times, and Elkanah asks his murmuring wife, "Am I not better to thee than ten sons?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>). Delitzsch thinks that some definite political arrangement is referred to, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the dynasties placed by Persian kings over conquered countries; and Tyler notes that in the Mishna a city is defined to be a place containing ten men of leisure; and we know that ten men were required for the establishment of a synagogue in any locality. The same idea was present in the Angle-Saxon arrangement of <span class="accented">tything</span> and <span class="accented">hundred</span>. The number, however, is probably used indefi<span class="accented">nitely</span> here as <span class="accented">seven in the</span> parallel passage of Ecclesiasticus (37:14), "<span class="accented">A</span> man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above in a high tower." The sentence may be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-15.htm">Proverbs 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-22.htm">Proverbs 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-5.htm">Proverbs 24:5</a>. The word rendered "mighty men" (<span class="accented">shallitim</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not necessarily a military <span class="accented">designation</span>; it is translated "ruler" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a>, and "governor" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>. The Septuagint here has <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">principes civitatis</span>. The persons intended are not primarily men of valor in war, like David's heroes, but rulers of sagacity, prudent statesmen, whose moral force is far greater and more efficacious than any merely physical excellence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.</body></html>
