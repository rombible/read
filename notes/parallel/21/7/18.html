(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm" title="In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand.</span> The pronouns refer to the two warnings in vers. 16 and 17 against over-righteousness and over-wicked-ness. Koheleth does not advise a man to make trial of opposite lines of conduct, to taste the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that from a wide experience lie may, like a man of the world, pursue a <span class="accented">safe</span> course; <span class="accented">this</span> would be poor <span class="accented">morality</span>, and unmeet for the stage at which his argument has arrived. Rather he advises him to lay to heart fire cautions above given, and learn from them to avoid all extremes. As Horace <span class="accented">says</span> ('Epist.,' 1:18. 9) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Folly, as usual, in extremes is seen,<br />While virtue nicely hits the happy mean."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) The Vulgate has interpolated a word, and taken the pronoun as masculine, to the sacrifice of the sense and connection: <span class="accented">Bonum est te sustentare justum</span>, <span class="accented">sed el ab illo ne subtrahas manum tuam</span>, "<span class="accented">It</span> is good that thou shouldst support the just man, nay, from him withdraw not thy hand." <span class="cmt_word">For he that feareth God shall come forth of them all</span>; shall escape both extremes together with their evil re-suits. The fear of God will keep a man from all excesses. The intransitive verb <span class="accented">yatsa</span>, "to go forth," is here used with an accusative (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-4.htm">Genesis 44:4</a>, which, however, is not quite analogous), as in Latin <span class="accented">ingrediurbem</span> (Livy, 1:29). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui timet Deum nihil negligit</span>. So Hitzig and Ginsburg, "<span class="accented">Goes</span>, makes his way with both," knows how to avail himself of piety and wickedness, which, as we have seen, is not the meaning. St. <span class="accented">Gregory</span>, <span class="accented">indeed</span>, who uses the Latin Version, notes that to fear God is never to pass over any good thing that ought to be aerie ('Moral.,' 1:3); but he is not professing to comment on the whole passage. Wright, after Delitzsch, takes the term "come out of" as equivalent to "fulfill," so that the meaning <span class="accented">would be</span>, "He who fears God performs all the duties mentioned above, and avoids extremes," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>, "These ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone." But this is confessedly a Talmudic use of the verb; and the Authorized Version may be safely adopted. The Septuagint gives, "For to them that fear God all things shall come forth well." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.</body></html>
