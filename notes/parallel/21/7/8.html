Here follow some <span class="accented">recommendations to patience and resignation under the ordering of God's providence</span>. Such conduct is shown to be true wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof.</span> This is not a repetition of the assertion in ver. I concealing the day of death and the day of birth, but states a truth in a certain sense generally true. The end is better because we then can form a right judgment about a matter; we see what was its purpose; we know whether it has been advantageous and prosperous or not. Christ's maxim, often repeated (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>, etc.), is, "He that shall endure unto the end shall be saved." No one living can be said to be so absolutely safe as that he can look to the great day without trembling. Death puts the seal to the good life, and, obviates the danger of falling away. Of course, if a thing is in itself evil, the gnome is not true (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>, etc.); but applied to things indifferent at the outset, it is as correct as generalizations can be. The lesson of patience is here taught. A man should not be precipitate in his judgments, but wait for the issue. From the ambiguity in the expression <span class="accented">dabar</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 6:11), many render it "word "in this passage. Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Melior est finis orationis</span>, <span class="accented">quam principium</span>; and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, or some such word, must be supplied. If this interpretation be preferred, we must either take the maxim as stating generally that few words are better than many, and that the sooner one concludes a speech, so much the better for speaker and hearer; or we must consider that the word intended is a well-merited rebuke, which, however severe and at first disliked, proves in the end wholesome and profitable. <span class="cmt_word">And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</span> "Patient" is literally "long of spirit," as the phrase, "short of spirit," is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a> to denote one who loses his temper and is impatient. To wait calmly for the result of an action, not to be hasty in arraigning Providence, is the part of a patient man; while the proud, inflated, conceited man, who thinks all must be arranged according to his notions, is never resigned or content, but rebels against the ordained course of events. "In your patience ye shall win your souls," said Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm">Luke 21:19</a>); and a Scotch proverb declares wisely, "He that weel bides, weel betides." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:7-10 The event of our trials and difficulties is often better than at first we thought. Surely it is better to be patient in spirit, than to be proud and hasty. Be not soon angry, nor quick in resenting an affront. Be not long angry; though anger may come into the bosom of a wise man, it passes through it as a way-faring man; it dwells only in the bosom of fools. It is folly to cry out upon the badness of our times, when we have more reason to cry out for the badness of our own hearts; and even in these times we enjoy many mercies. It is folly to cry up the goodness of former times; as if former ages had not the like things to complain of that we have: this arises from discontent, and aptness to quarrel with God himself.</body></html>
