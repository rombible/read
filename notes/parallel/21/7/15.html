Koheleth gives his own experience of an anomalous condition which often obtains in human affairs. "All," being here defined by the article, must refer to the cases which he has mentioned or proceeds to mention. "The days of vanity" mean merely "fleeting, vain days" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>). The expression denotes the writer's view of the emptiness and transitoriness of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>), and it may also have special reference to his own vain efforts to solve the problems of existence. <span class="cmt_word">There is a just</span> (<span class="accented">righteous</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>man that perisheth in his righteousness</span>. Here is a difficulty about the dispensation of good and evil, which has always perplexed the thoughtful. It finds expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, though the singer propounds a solution (ver. 17) which Koheleth misses. The meaning of the preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) before "righteousness" is disputed. Delitzsch, Wright, and others take it as equivalent to "in spite of," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>, where "in this thing" means "notwithstanding," "for all this thing." Righteousness has the promise of long life and prosperity; it is an anomaly that it should meet with disaster and early death. We cannot argue from this that the author did not believe in temporal rewards and punishments; he states merely certain of his own experiences, which may be abnormal and capable of explanation. For his special purpose this was sufficient. Others take the preposition to mean "through," "in consequence of." Good men have always been persecuted for righteousness' sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>), and so far the interpretation is quite admissible, and is perhaps supported by ver. 16, which makes a certain sort of righteousness the cause of disaster. But looking to the second clause of the present verse, where we can hardly suppose that the wicked man is said to attain to long life in consequence of his wickedness, we are safe in adopting the rendering, "in spite of." <span class="cmt_word">There is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in</span> (<span class="accented">in spite of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his wickedness</span>. The verb <span class="accented">arak</span>, "to make long," "to prolong," is used both with and without the accusative "days" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, There is an ungodly man remaining in his wickedness," which does not convey the sense of the original. According to the moral government of God experienced by the Hebrews in their history, the sinner was to suffer calamity and to be cut off prematurely. This is the contention of Job's friends, against which he argues so warmly. The writer of the Book of Wisdom has learned to look for the correction of such anomalies in another life. He sees that length of days is not always a blessing, and that retribution awaits the evil beyond the grave (Wisd. 1:9 Wisd. 3:4, 10 Wisd. 4:8, 19, etc.). Abel perished in early youth; Cain had his days prolonged. This apparent inversion of moral order leads to another reflection concerning the danger of exaggerations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.</body></html>
