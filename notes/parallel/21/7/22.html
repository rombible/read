The fact that we often speak ill of others should make us less open to take offence at what is said of ourselves, and prepared to expect unfavorable comments. The Lord has said, "Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1, 2</a>). This is a universal law. "Who is he," asks Ben-Sirs, "that hath not offended with his tongue?" (Ecclus. 19:16). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "For many times he [thy servant] shall act ill to thee, and in many ways shall afflict thine heart, for even thou also hast cursed others." This seems to be a combination of two renderings of the passage. "<span class="accented">It</span> is the praise of perfect greatness to meet hostile treatment, without bravely and within mercifully some things are more quickly dismissed from our hearts if we know our own misdemeanors against our neighbors. For whilst we reflect what we have been towards others, we are the less concerned that others should have proved such persons towards ourselves, be cause the injustice of another avenges in us what our conscience justly accuses in itself" (St. Gregory, 'Moral.,' 22:26). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.</body></html>
