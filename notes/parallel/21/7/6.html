In the East, and where wood is scarce, thorns, hay, and stubble are used for fuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>). Such materials are quickly kindled, blaze up for a time with much noise, and soon die away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>). So is the laughter of the fool. The point of comparison is the loud crackling and the short duration of the fire with small results. <span class="cmt_word">So the fool's mirth is boisterous and noisy, but comes to a speedy end, and is spent to no good purpose.</span> So in Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>) we have, "The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment." All this profitless mirth is again nothing but vanity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 Reputation for piety and honesty is more desirable than all the wealth and pleasure in this world. It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools. The laughter of a fool is soon gone, the end of his mirth is heaviness.</body></html>
