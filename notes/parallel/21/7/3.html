It is accordingly adopted here by the older translators, but the rendering of our version is required by the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sorrow is better than laughter</span>. This is a further expansion of the previous maxim, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> (kaas), as contrasted with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;</span>, is rightly rendered "sorrow," "melancholy," or, as Ginsburg contends, "thoughtful sadness." The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">ira</span>; but auger is not the feeling produced by a visit to the house of mourning. Such a scene produces saddening reflection, which is in itself a moral training, and is more wholesome and elevating than thoughtless mirth. <span class="cmt_word">For by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</span> The feeling which shows itself by the look of sadness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-7.htm">Genesis 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a>) has a purifying effect on the heart, gives a moral tone to the character. Professor Tayler Lewis renders the clause, "For in the sad. ness of the face the heart becometh fair;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sorrow beautifies the soul, producing, as it were, comeliness, spiritual beauty, and, in the end, serener happiness. The Vulgate translates the passage thus: <span class="accented">Melter eat ira risu</span>; <span class="accented">quia per tristitiam vultus corrigitur animus deliquentis</span>, "Better is anger than laughter, because through sadness of countenance the mind of the offender is corrected." The anger is that either of God or of good men which reproves sin; the laughter is that of sinners who thus show their connivance at or approval of evil. There can be no doubt that this is not the sense of the passage. For the general sentiment concerning the moral influence of grief and suffering, we may compare the Greek sayings, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>; which are almost equivalent in meaning (comp. AEschyl., 'Again.,' 170; Herod., 1:207). The Latins would say, "Quaenocent, docent," and we, "Pain is gain." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 Reputation for piety and honesty is more desirable than all the wealth and pleasure in this world. It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools. The laughter of a fool is soon gone, the end of his mirth is heaviness.</body></html>
