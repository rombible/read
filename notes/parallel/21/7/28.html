He found only one man among a thousand that reached his standard of excellence - the ideal that he had formed for himself, who could be rightly called by the noble name of man. The phrase, "one of a thousand," occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23</a>; Ecclus. 6:6 (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, as in the Septuagint here). <span class="accented">Adam</span>, the generic term, is used here instead of <span class="accented">ish</span>, the individual, to emphasize the antithetical <span class="accented">ishah</span>, "<span class="accented">woman</span>," in the following clause, or to lead the thought to the original perfection of man's nature. So in Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is sometimes used for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, though generally the distinction between the two is sufficiently marked, as we find in Herodotus, 7:210, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">But a woman among all those have I not found</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not one woman in a thousand who was what a woman ought to be. Says the Son of Sirach, "All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman; let the portion of a sinner fall upon her" (Ecclus. 25:19). So the Greek gnome - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Three evils are there - sea, fire, and woman."</span> Solomon had a thousand wives and concubines, and his experience might well have been that mentioned in this passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:23-29 Solomon, in his search into the nature and reason of things, had been miserably deluded.
