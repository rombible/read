This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, it is plain that the Preacher does not in the latter place recommend reckless enjoyment, but enjoyment tempered by the fear of God, and looking to the end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting.</span> The thought in the last verse leads to the recollection of the circumstances which accompany the two events therein mentioned - birth and death, feasting and joy, in the first case; sorrow and mourning in the second. In recommending the sober, earnest life, Koheleth teaches that wiser, more enduring lessons are to be learned where grief reigns than in the empty and momentary excitement of mirth and joyousness. The house in question is mourning for a death; and what a long and harrowing business this was is well known (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a>; Ecclus. 22:10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>, etc.). Visits of condolence and periodical pilgrimages to groves of departed relatives were considered duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm">John 11:19, 31</a>), and conduced to the growth in the mind of sympathy, seriousness, and the need of preparation for death. The opposite side, the house of carousal, where all that is serious is put away, leading to such scenes as Isaiah denounces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>), offers no wise teaching, and produces only selfishness, heartlessness, thoughtlessness. What is said here is no contradiction to what was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, that there was nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and enjoy himself. For Koheleth was not speaking of unrestrained sensualism - the surrender of the mind to the pleasures of the body - but of the moderate enjoyment of the good things of life conditioned by the fear of God and love of one's neighbor. This statement is quite compatible with the view that sees a higher purpose and training in the sympathy with sorrow than in participation in reckless frivolity. <span class="cmt_word">For that is the end of all men</span> viz. that they will some day be mourned, that their house will be turned into a house of mourning. Vulgate, In <span class="accented">illa</span> (<span class="accented">dome</span>) <span class="accented">enim finis cunctorum admonetur hominum</span>, which is not the sense of the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">The living will lay it to his heart.</span> He who has witnessed this scene will consider it seriously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>), and draw from it profitable conclusions concerning the brevity of life and the proper use to make thereof. We recall the words of Christ, "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted;" and "Woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-25.htm">Luke 6:25</a>). Schultens gives an Arab proverb which says, "Hearest thou lamentation for the dead, hasten to the spot; art thou called to a banquet, cross not the threshold." The Septuagint thus translates the last clause, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> "The living will put good into his heart;" the Vulgate paraphrases fairly, <span class="accented">Et vivens cogitat quid futurum sit</span>," The living thinks what is to come." "So teach us to number our days," prays the psalmist, "that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 Reputation for piety and honesty is more desirable than all the wealth and pleasure in this world. It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools. The laughter of a fool is soon gone, the end of his mirth is heaviness.</body></html>
