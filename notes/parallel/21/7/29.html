Thus in the Book of Wisdom (2:23) we read, "God created man to be immortal, and made him an imago of his own nature (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>).

Man has thus abased his free-will, and employed the inventive faculty with which he was endowed in excoriating evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>). How this state of things came about, how the originally good man became thus wicked, the writer does not tell. He knows from revelation that God made him upright; he knows from experience that he is now evil; and he leaves the matter there.
