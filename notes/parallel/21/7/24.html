(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm" title="Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yes farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</span> The broken, interjectional style of the original in this passage, as Professor Taylor Lewis terms it, is better brought out by translating, "Far off is that which is, and deep, deep: who can find it out?" Professor Lewis renders, "Far off! the past, what is it? Deep - a deep - oh, who can find?" and explains "the past" to mean, not merely the earthly past historically unknown, but the great past before the creation of the universe, the kingdom of all eternities with its ages of ages, its worlds of worlds, its mighty evolutions, its infinite variety. We prefer to retain the rendering, "that which is," and to refer the expression to the phenomenal world. It is not the essence of wisdom that is spoken of, but the facts of man's life and the circumstances in which he finds himself, the course of the world, the phenomena of nature, etc. These things - their causes, connection, interdependence - we cannot explain satisfactorily (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>). In the Book of Wisdom (7:17-21) Solomon is supposed to have arrived at this abstruse knowledge, "for," he says, "God hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;</span>)," and he proceeds to enumerate the various departments which this "universitas literarum" has opened to him. The Septuagint (and virtually the Vulgate) connects this verse with the preceding, thus: . 'I said, I will be wise, and it (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) was far from me, far beyond what was (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>), and deep depth: who shall find it out?" (For the epithet "deep" applied to what is recondite or what is beyond human comprehension, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-5.htm">Proverbs 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:23-29 Solomon, in his search into the nature and reason of things, had been miserably deluded. But he here speaks with godly sorrow. He alone who constantly aims to please God, can expect to escape; the careless sinner probably will fall to rise no more.
