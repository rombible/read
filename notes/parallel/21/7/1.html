It was probably an older proverb, which the Preacher completes by the startling addition, "and so is the day of death better than that of birth." For the use of perfumes, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-3.htm" title="Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your raiment on you, and get you down to the floor: but make not yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.">Ruth 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-20.htm" title="Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.">2Samuel 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-17.htm" title="I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.">Proverbs 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm" title="I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.">Daniel 10:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>. - Division II.

Though no man knows for certain what is best, yet there are <span class="accented">some practical rules for the conduct of life which wisdom gives</span>. Some of these Koheleth sets forward in the proverbial form, recommending a serious, earnest life in preference to one of gaiety and frivolity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A good name is better than precious ointment.</span> The paronomasia here is to be remarked, <span class="accented">rob ahem mishemen tob</span>. There is a similar assonance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-3.htm">Song of Solomon 1:3</a>, which the German translator reproduces by the sentence, "Besser gut Gerucht als Wohlgeruch," or," gute Geruche," and which may perhaps be rendered in English, "Better is good favor than good flavor." It is a proverbial saying, running literally, <span class="accented">Better is a name than good oil</span>. <span class="accented">Shem</span>, "name," is sometimes used unqualified to signify a celebrated name, good name, reputation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Melius eat nomen bonum quam unguenta pre-tiosa</span>. Odorous unguents were very precious in the mind of an Oriental, and formed one of the luxuries lavished at feasts and costly entertainments, or social visits (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-3.htm">Ruth 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>; Wisd. 2:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37, 46</a>). It was a man's most cherished ambition to leave a good reputation, and to hand down an honorable remembrance to distant posterity, and this all the more as the hope of the life beyond the grave was dim and vague (see on Ecclesiastes 2:16, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>). The complaint of the sensualists in Wisd. 2:4 is embittered by the thought," Our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance." We employ a metaphor like that in the clause when we speak of a man's reputation having a good or ill odor; and the Hebrews said of ill fame that it stank in the nostrils (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>; see, on the opposite side, Ecclus. 24:15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the day of death than the day of one's birth.</span> The thought in this clause is closely connected with the preceding. If a man's life is such that he leaves a good name behind him, then the day of his departure is better than that of his birth, because in the latter he had nothing before him but labor, and trouble, and fear, and uncertainty; and in the former all these anxieties are past, the storms are successfully battled with, the haven is won (see on Ecclesiastes 4:3). According to Solon's well-known maxim, no one can be called happy till he has crowned a prosperous life by a peaceful death (Herod., 1:32; Soph., 'Trachin.,' 1-3; ('Ed. Tyr.,' 1528, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.); as the Greek gnome runs - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Call no man great till thou hast seen him dead."</span> So Ben-Sira, "Judge none blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) before his death; for a man shall be known in his children" (Ecclus. 11:28). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 Reputation for piety and honesty is more desirable than all the wealth and pleasure in this world. It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools. The laughter of a fool is soon gone, the end of his mirth is heaviness.</body></html>
