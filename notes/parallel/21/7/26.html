Tracing men's folly and madness to their source, he finds that they arise generally from the seductions of the female sex. Beginning with Adam, woman has continued to work mischief in the world. "Of the woman came the beginning of sin," says Siracides, "and through her we all die" (Ecclus. 25:24); it was owing to her that the punishment of death was inflicted on the human race. If Solomon himself were speaking, he had indeed a bitter experience of the sin and misery into which women lead their victims (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1, 4, 11</a>). It may be thought that Koheleth refers here especially to "the strange woman" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, etc.; Proverbs 5:3, etc.; but in ver. 28 he speaks of the whole sex without qualification; so that we must conclude that he had a very low opinion of them. It is no ideal personage whom he is introducing; it is not a personification of vice or folly; but woman in her totality, such as he knew her to be in Oriental courts and homes, denied her proper position, degraded, uneducated, all natural affections crushed or undeveloped, the plaything of her lord, to be flung aside at any moment. It is not surprising that Koheleth's impression of the female sex should be unfavorable. He is not singular in such an opinion. One might fill a large page with proverbs and gnomes uttered in disparagement of woman by men of all ages and countries. Men, having the making of such apothegms, have used their license unmercifully; if the maligned sex had equal liberty, the tables might have been reversed. But, really, in this as in other cases the mean is the safest; and practically those who have given the darkest picture of women have not been slow to recognize the brighter side. If. for instance, the Book of Proverbs paints the adulteress and the harlot in the soberest, most appalling colors, the same book affords us such a sketch of the virtuous matron as is unequalled for vigor, truth, and high appreciation. And if, as in our present chapter, Koheleth shows a bitter feeling against the evil side of woman's nature, he knows how to value the comfort of married life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>), and to look upon a good wife as one who makes a man's home happy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>). Since the incarnation of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, "the Seed of the woman," we have learned to regard woman in her true light, and to assign her that position to which she is entitled, giving honor unto her as the weaker vessel, and, at the same time, heir with us of the glorious hope and destiny of our renewed nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whose heart is snares and nets</span>; more accurately, <span class="accented">who is snares</span>, <span class="accented">and nets in her heart</span>; Septuagint, "The woman who is a snare, and her heart nets;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quae laqueus venatorum est</span>, <span class="accented">et sagena cot ejus</span>.
