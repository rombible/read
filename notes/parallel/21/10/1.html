It is like the apostle's warning to his converts, "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). The Hebrew expression is literally, "flies of death," which may mean either "dead flies," as in our version and the Vulgate (<span class="accented">muses morientes</span>), or "deadly, poisonous flies," as in the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The latter rendering seems preferable, if we regard the use of similar compound phrases, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "instruments of death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a>: [13]); "snares of death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>); and in New Testament Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "the death-stroke" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3, 12</a>). The flies meant are such as are poisonous in their bite, or carry infection with them. Such insects corrupt anything which they touch - food, ointment, whether they perish where they alight or not. They, as the Hebrew says, <span class="accented">make to stink, make to ferment, the oil of the perfumer</span>. The singular verb is here used with the plural subject to express the unity of the individuals, "flies" forming one complete idea. The Septuagint rendering omits one of the verbs: <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Corrupt a preparation of sweet ointment." The point, of course, is the comparative insignificance of the cause which spoils a costly substance compounded with care and skill. Thus little faults mar great characters and reputations. "A good name is better than precious ointment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>), but a good name is ruined by follies, and then it stinks in men's nostrils. The term, "ointment of the apothecary," is used by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>, etc.) in describing the holy chrism which was reserved for special occasions. So doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor. The meaning of the Authorized Version is tolerably correct, but the actual rendering will hardly stand, and one wants some verb to govern "him that," etc. The other versions vary. Septuagint, "A little wisdom is more precious (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) than great glory of folly;" Vulgate, "More precious are wisdom and glory than small and short-lived folly;" Jerome, "Precious above wisdom and glory is a little folly." This last interpretation proceeds upon the idea that such "folly" is at any rate free from pride, and has few glaring faults. "Dulce est desipere in loco," says Horace ('Carm.,' 4:12. 28). But the original is best translated thus: "More weighty than wisdom, than honor, is a little folly." It is a painful fact that a little folly, one foolish act, one silly peculiarity of manner or disposition, will suffice to impair the real value of a matt's wisdom and the estimation in which he was held. The little clement of foolishness, like the little insect in the ointment, obscures the real excellence of the man, and deprives him of the honor that is really his due. And in religion we know that one fault unchecked, one Secret sin cherished, poisons the whole character, makes a man lose the grace of God. (For the same effect from another cause, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-20.htm">Ezekiel 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-13.htm">Ezekiel 33:13</a>.) Jerome sees in the "dead flies" wicked thoughts put into the Christian's mind by Beelzebub, "the lord of flies." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-3 Those especially who make a profession of religion, should keep from all appearances of evil. A wise man has great advantage over a fool, who is always at a loss when he has anything to do. Sin is the reproach of sinners, wherever they go, and shows their folly.</body></html>
