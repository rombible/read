Literally translated it is, <span class= "ital">If the serpent bite for lack of enchantment, there is no advantage to the master of the tongue. </span>It seems best to follow the LXX. and other interpreters, and take the "master of the tongue" to mean the snake charmer, who possesses the "voice of the charmer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-5.htm" title="Which will not listen to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.">Psalm 58:5</a>). The whisperings of the snake charmer, so often described by Eastern travellers, are referred to also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-17.htm" title="For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:17</a>, and in a passage, probably founded on the present text (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/12-13.htm" title="Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts?">Ecclesiasticus 12:13</a>), "Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent?" The mention of the serpent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm" title="He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoever breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a> seems to have suggested another illustration of the advantage of wisdom in the different effects of snake-charming, as used by the expert or the unskilful. The phrase, "master of the tongue," seems to have been chosen in order to lead on to the following verses, which speak of the different use of the tongue by the wise man and the fool.<p><span class= "bld">Enchantment.</span>--According to the primary meaning "whispering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-19.htm" title="But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.">2Samuel 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-16.htm" title="LORD, in trouble have they visited you, they poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.">Isaiah 26:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">No better.--</span>No advantage to. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm" title="What profit has a man of all his labor which he takes under the sun?">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The last proverb of this little series shows the necessity of seizing the right opportunity. <span class="cmt_word">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment.</span> The Authorized Version is not quite correct. The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dd;</span>, with which the verse begins, is here conditional, and the rendering should be, <span class="accented">If the serpent bite</span>, etc.; the apodosis comes in the next clause. The idea is taken up from ver. 8. If one handles a serpent without due precaution or without knowing the secret of charming it, one will suffer for it. The taming and charming of poisonous snakes is still, as heretofore, practiced in Egypt and the East. What the secret of this power is has not been accurately determined; whether it belongs especially to persons of a certain idiosyncrasy, whether it is connected with certain words or intonations of the voice or musical sounds, we do not know. Of the existence of the power from remote antiquity there can be no question. Allusions to it in Scripture are common enough (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>; Ecclus. 12:13). If a serpent before it is charmed is dangerous, what then? The Authorized Version affords no sensible apodosis: <span class="cmt_word">And a babbler is no better</span>. The words rendered "babbler" (<span class="accented">baul hallashon</span>) are literally "master of the tongue," and by them is meant the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "the serpent-charmer." The clause should <span class="accented">run, Then there is no use in the charmer</span>. If the man is bitten before he has time to use his charm, it is no profit to him that he has the secret, it is too late to employ it when the mischief is done. This is to shut the stable door after the steed is stolen. The maxim enforces the warning against being too late; the greatest skill is useless unless applied at the right moment. The Septuagint translates virtually as above, "If a serpent bites when not charmed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>), then there is no advantage to the charmer (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1fb4;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>)." The Vulgate departs from the context, rendering, <span class="accented">Si mordeat serpens in silentio</span> (i.e. probably "uncharmed"), <span class="accented">nihil eo minus habet qui occulte detrahit</span>, "He is nothing better who slanders secretly," which St. Jerome thus explains: the serpent and the slanderer are alike, for as the serpent stealthily infuses its poison, so the secret slanderer pours his venom into another's breast. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:11-15 There is a practice in the East, of charming serpents by music. The babbler's tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison; and contradiction only makes it the more violent. We must find the way to keep him gentle. But by rash, unprincipled, or slanderous talk, he brings open or secret vengeance upon himself. Would we duly consider our own ignorance as to future events, it would cut off many idle words which we foolishly multiply. Fools toil a great deal to no purpose. They do not understand the plainest things, such as the entrance into a great city. But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city, that it is a high-way, in which the simplest wayfaring men shall not err, Isa 25:8. But sinful folly makes men miss that only way to happiness.</body></html>
