Perhaps nothing better can be said than that the common theme of these proverbs is the advantage of wisdom, and here in particular of caution in great enterprises. It is forcing the connection to imagine that the enterprise from which the writer seeks to dissuade, is that of rebellion against the ruler whose error is condemned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm" title="There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceeds from the ruler:">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Diggeth a pit.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm" title="Whoever digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return on him.">Proverbs 26:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/27-26.htm" title="Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.">Ecclesiasticus 27:26</a>. The word here used for "pit" is found in later Hebrew, and nowhere else in the Old Testament.<p><span class= "bld">An hedge.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a stone wall, </span>in the crevices of which serpents often have their habitation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-31.htm" title="And, see, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.">Proverbs 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-9.htm" title="He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he has made my paths crooked.">Lamentations 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm" title="As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.">Amos 5:19</a>.) This verse admits of a curious verbal comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm" title="And they that shall be of you shall build the old waste places: you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.">Isaiah 58:12</a>, "builder of the breach," in one, answering to "breacher of the building" in the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - Section 13. <span class="accented">Various proverbs expressing the benefit of prudence and caution, and the danger of folly</span>. The connection with what has preceded is not closely marked, but is probably to be found in the bearing of the maxims on the conduct of the wise man who has incurred the resentment of a ruler, and might be inclined to disaffection and revolt. They are intentionally obscure and capable of a double sense - a necessary precaution if the writer lived under Persian despots. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it.</span> This proverb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>, and, as expressive of the retribution that awaits evil-doers, finds parallels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; Ecclus. 27:25, 26. The" pit" (<span class="accented">gummats</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is such a one as was made to capture wild animals, and the maker of it is supposed to approach it incautiously, and to fall into it. But the scope of our passage is rather to speak of what may possibly occur than to insist on the Nemesis that inevitably overtakes transgressors. Its object is to inspire caution in the prosecution of dangerous undertakings, whether the enterprise be the overthrow of a tyrant, or any other action of importance, or whether, as some suppose, the arraignment of the providential ordering of events is intended, in which ease there would be the danger of blasphemy and impatience. <span class="cmt_word">And whoso breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him</span>. The futures throughout vers. 8 and 9 are not intended to express certainty, as if the results mentioned were inevitable, but rather possibility, and might be rendered, with Delitzsch, "may fall," "may bite," etc. The "hedge" is rather a wall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>), in the crevices of which poisonous snakes have made their abode, which are disturbed by its demolition (comp. Ames 5:19). <span class="accented">Nachash</span>, here used, is the generic name of any serpent. The majority of the snakes found in Palestine are harmless; but there are some which are very deadly, especially the cobra and those which belong to the viper family. There is no allusion here to the illegal removal of landmarks, a proceeding which might be supposed to provoke retribution; the hedge or wail is one which the demolisher is justified in removing, only in doing so he must look out for certain contingencies, and guard against them. Metaphorically, the pulling down a wall may refer to the removal of evil institutions in a state, which involves the reformer in many difficulties and perils. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:4-10 Solomon appears to caution men not to seek redress in a hasty manner, nor to yield to pride and revenge. Do not, in a passion, quit thy post of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yielding pacifies great offences. Men are not preferred according to their merit. And those are often most forward to offer help, who are least aware of the difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark is applied to the church, or the body of Christ, that all the members should have the same care one for another.</body></html>
