This is an instance of the error intimated in the preceding verse. A tyrannical ruler exalts incompetent persons, unworthy favorites, to "great heights" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint), as it is literally - puts them into eminent positions. "Folly" is abstract for concrete, "fools." <span class="accented">And the rich sit in low place</span>. "The rich" (<span class="accented">ushirim</span>) are not simply those who have wealth, however obtained, but men of noble birth; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, as Plumptre appositely notes, persons of ancestral wealth, who from natural position might be looked upon as rulers of men. Such men would seek eminent stations, not from base motives of gain, but from an honorable ambition, and yet they are often slighted by unworthy princes and kept in low estate (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>; Ecclus. 11:5, 6). The experience mentioned in this and the following verses could scarcely have been Solomon's, though it has been always common enough in the East, where the most startling changes have been made, the lowest persons have been suddenly raised to eminence, mistresses and favorites loaded with dignities, and oppression of the rich has been systematically pursued. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:4-10 Solomon appears to caution men not to seek redress in a hasty manner, nor to yield to pride and revenge. Do not, in a passion, quit thy post of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yielding pacifies great offences. Men are not preferred according to their merit. And those are often most forward to offer help, who are least aware of the difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark is applied to the church, or the body of Christ, that all the members should have the same care one for another.</body></html>
