The subject is still the state. Under the image of a house which falls into ruin for lack of needful repairs, is signified the decay that surely overtakes a kingdom whose rulers are given up to indolence and debauchery, and neglect to attend to the affairs which require prompt care (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>). Such were they whom Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) denounced, "That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph." "Much slothfulness" is expressed in the original by a dual form, which gives an intensive signification. Ewald and Ginsburg take it as referring to the "two idle hands;" but the intensifications of the dual is not unprecedented (see Delitzsch, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The rest of this clause is more accurately rendered, <span class="accented">the rafters sink, i.e.</span> the timber framework, whether of roof or wall, gives way. This may possibly not be noticed at once, but it makes itself known unmistakably ere long. <span class="cmt_word">And through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the house leaketh</span>, the roof lets in the rain. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "Through laziness of hands the house will drip." The very imperfect construction of the fiat roofs of Eastern houses demanded continual attention. Such common and annoying occurrences as a leaky roof are mentioned in the Book of Proverbs (see 19:13; 27:15). Plautus, ' Mostell.,' 1:2.28 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ventat imber, lavit parietes; perpluunt<br />Tigna; putrefacit aer operam fabri."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The rain comes down, and washes all the walls,<br />The roof is leaky, and the weather rough<br />Loosens the architect's most skilful work."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:16-20 The happiness of a land depends on the character of its rulers. The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish, and lovers of pleasure. Slothfulness is of ill consequence both to private and public affairs. Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe, though it answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to be had, may generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. His ear is ever open. Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought. Your curses cannot affect Him; but his curse, coming down upon you, will sink you to the lowest hell.</body></html>
