Koheleth warns against this error; it is dangerous to give way to it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a> the motive for submission to the king is placed on religious grounds; in the present passage the ground is prudence, regard for personal safety, which might be compromised by plain speaking, especially when one has to do with such depraved and unscrupulous persons. We may compare David's generous conduct to his cruel persecutor Saul, whom he spared because he was the Lord's anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>, l0; 26:9, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>). <span class="accented">Madda</span>, "thought," "consciousness," is rare, and is supposed to belong to late Hebrew (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10, 11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4, 17</a>). The Septuagint translates it <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">cogitatio</span>. To encourage such thoughts in the mind is to run the risk of openly expressing them at some unguarded moment; for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." <span class="cmt_word">Curse not the rich in thy bedchamber</span>. In ability to injure, the rich stand in the same category as the king. You are not safe <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "in your very bedchamber," where, if anywhere, you would fancy yourself free from espionage. But "walls have ears," says the proverb (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>); and the King of Syria is warned, "Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the King of Israel the words thou speakest in thy bedchamber" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm">2 Kings 6:12</a>). "That which ye have spoken in the ear in closets (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) shall be proclaimed upon the housetops" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For a bird of the air shall carry the voice</span>. A proverbial saying, common to all languages, and not to be referred especially to the story of the cranes of Ibycus (see Erasmus,' Adag.,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. "Ultio malefacti") or to the employment of carrier pigeons. We say of secret information, "a little bird told me." Plumptre quotes Aristophanes, 'Aves,' 575 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No one knows of my treasure, save, it may be, a bird."</span> On which the Scholiast notes, "There is a proverb extant, ' No one observes me but the passing bird'" (comp. Erasmus, ' Adag.,' s.v. "Occulta"). In Koheleth's day informers evidently plied their trade industriously, and here meet, not only with notice, but ironically with reprobation. On the general sentiment of the verse, we may quote Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 9:102, "O Corydon, Corydon," thus versified in Ginsburg's commentary - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And dost thou seriously believe, fond swain,<br />The actions of the great unknown remain?<br />Poor Corydon! even beasts would silence break,<br />And stocks and stones, if servants did not, speak.<br />Bolt every door, stop every cranny tight,<br />Close every window, put out every light;<br />Let not a whisper reach the listening ear,<br />No noise, no motion; let no soul be near;<br />Yet all that passed at the cock's second crow,<br />The neighboring vintner shall, ere day-break, know."</span> <span class="cmt_word">That which hath wings</span> (compare Latin <span class="accented">ales</span>); the possessor (<span class="accented">haul</span>) of a pair of wings, a periphrasis for "a bird," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-17.htm">Proverbs 1:17</a>. We had "master of the tongue," ver. 11; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-6.htm">Daniel 8:6, 20</a>, "having horns," is "master (<span class="accented">haul</span>) of horns." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:16-20 The happiness of a land depends on the character of its rulers. The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish, and lovers of pleasure. Slothfulness is of ill consequence both to private and public affairs. Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe, though it answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to be had, may generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. His ear is ever open. Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought. Your curses cannot affect Him; but his curse, coming down upon you, will sink you to the lowest hell.</body></html>
