and we can only say of the rendering in the text that it seems to be preferred to any which it has been proposed to substitute for it. The mention of cutting wood in the preceding verse suggests the illustration from the axe, exemplifying how wisdom will serve instead of strength.<p><span class= "bld">Iron.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-5.htm" title="But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.">2Kings 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm" title="And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.">Isaiah 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-17.htm" title="Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.">Proverbs 27:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Whet.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a>, where it is translated "make bright."<p><span class= "bld">Edge.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">face. </span>We have often in Hebrew "mouth of the sword," for edge of the sword, but the only parallel for the expression "face" in that sense is in the highly poetical passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-16.htm" title="Go you one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, wherever your face is set.">Ezekiel 21:16</a>, just referred to.<p><span class= "bld">Must he put to more strength.--"</span>Make his strength mighty," the words being nearly the same as in the phrase "mighty men of strength" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm" title="And their brothers among all the families of Issachar were valiant men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies fourscore and seven thousand.">1Chronicles 7:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge</span>. The illustration at the end of the last verse is continued. The "iron" is the axe used in cutting wood; if this be blunted by the work to which it is put, and he, the laborer, has not sharpened the edge (Hebrew, <span class="accented">the face</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1</a>), what is the consequence? How is he to carry on his work? <span class="cmt_word">Then must he put to more strength</span>. He must put more force in his blows, he must make up for the want of edge by added power and weight. This is the simplest explanation of the passage, which contains many linguistic difficulties. These may be seen discussed at length in the commentaries of Delitzsch, Wright, Nowack, etc. The translation of Ginsburg is not commendable, "If the axe be blunt, and he (the tyrant's opponent)do not sharpen it beforehand (<span class="accented">phanim</span>, taken as an adverb of time), he (the tyrant) shall only increase the army." The Septuagint is obscure, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "If the axe should fall, then he troubles his face, and he shall strengthen his forces (? double his strength);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si retusum fuerit ferrurn, et hoc non ut prius, sed hebetatum fuerit, multo labore exacuetur</span>, "If the iron shall be blunted, and it be not as before, but have become dull, it shall be sharpened with much labor." <span class="cmt_word">But wisdom is profitable to direct</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the advantage of setting right is</span> (<span class="accented">on the side of</span>) <span class="accented">wisdom</span>. Wisdom teaches how to conduct matters to a successful termination; for instance, it prompts the worker to sharpen his tool instead of trying to accomplish his task by an exertion of mere brute strength. The gnome applies to all the instances which have been mentioned above. Wisdom alone enables a man to meet and overcome the dangers and difficulties which beset his social, common, and political life. If we apply the whole sentence to the case of disaffection with the government or open rebellion, the caution given would signify - See that your means are adequate to the end, that your resources are sufficient to conduct your enterprise to success.

Do not, in a passion, quit thy post of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yielding pacifies great offences. Men are not preferred according to their merit. And those are often most forward to offer help, who are least aware of the difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark is applied to the church, or the body of Christ, that all the members should have the same care one for another.</body></html>
