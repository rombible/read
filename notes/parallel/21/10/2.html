The right hand is the place of honor, the left of inferiority, as a matter of fact, not of superstition and luck. The symbolism is intimated in Christ's account of the judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, etc.). But in the present passage we should best paraphrase - The wise man's heart, his understanding and sentiments, lead him to what is right and proper and straightforward; the fool's heart leads him astray, in the wrong direction. The former is active and skilful, the latter is slow and awkward. One, we may say, has no left hand, the other has no right. To be at the right hand is to be ready to help and guard. "The Lord is at thy right band," to protect thee, <span class="accented">says</span> the psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>). The wise <span class="accented">man's</span> mind shows him how to escape dangers and direct his course safely; the fool's mind helps him not to any good pur<span class="accented">pose</span>, causes him to err and miss his best object. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-3 Those especially who make a profession of religion, should keep from all appearances of evil. A wise man has great advantage over a fool, who is always at a loss when he has anything to do. Sin is the reproach of sinners, wherever they go, and shows their folly.</body></html>
