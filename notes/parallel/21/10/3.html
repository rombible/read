But it is better, as well as more obvious, to take the verse of the self-betrayal of the fool (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-16.htm" title="Every prudent man deals with knowledge: but a fool lays open his folly.">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-28.htm" title="Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise: and he that shuts his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.">Proverbs 17:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-2.htm" title="A fool has no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.">Proverbs 18:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way.</span> As soon as ever he sets his foot outside the house, and mixes with other men, he exhibits his folly. If he remained at home he might keep his real ineptitude concealed; but such persons as he are unconscious of their inanity, and take no pains to hide it; they go where, they act as, their foolish heart prompts them. There is no metaphor here, nor any reference to the fool being put in the right path and perversely turning away. It is simply, as the Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="cmt_word">His wisdom</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">heart</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>faileth him</span>. Ginsburg and others render, <span class="accented">"He</span> lacketh his <span class="accented">mind,"</span> want of heart being continually taken in the Book of Proverbs as equivalent to deficiency of understanding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>, etc.). But Delitzsch and Wright consider the order of the words and the suffix to be against this view, and they translate as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his understanding is at fault. <span class="cmt_word">And he saith to every one that he is a fool.</span> The sentence is ambiguous, and capable of two interpretations. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Cumipse insipiens sit, omnes stultos aestimat</span>. Jerome quotes Symmachus as rendering, "He suspects all men that they are fools." According to this view, the fool in his conceit thinks that every one he meets is a fool, says this in his mind, like the sluggard in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-16.htm">Proverbs 26:16</a>, "Who is wiser in his own conceit than ten men that can render a reason." Another explanation, more closely in accordance with the foregoing clauses, takes the pronoun in "he is a fool" to refer to the man himself, <span class="accented">se</span> <span class="accented">esse stultum</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9</a>:21 [20], "Let the nations know themselves to be but men"). As soon as he goes abroad, his words and actions display his real character; he betrays himself; he says virtually to all with whom he has to do, "I am a fool" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a>). It is hard to say to which interpretation the Septuagint inclines, giving, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, "And all that he will think is folly." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-3 Those especially who make a profession of religion, should keep from all appearances of evil. A wise man has great advantage over a fool, who is always at a loss when he has anything to do. Sin is the reproach of sinners, wherever they go, and shows their folly.</body></html>
