Alive the word was <span class="accented">kesil</span>, which denotes rather the self-confidence of the dull and stupid <span class="accented">man</span>. <span class="accented">Moreover the fool multiplieth words</span>. He not only speaks foolishly, but he says too much (cutup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>). It is not mere loquacity that is here predicated of the fool, though that is one of his characteristics, but, as-the rest of the verse shows, the prating of things about which he knows nothing. He talks as though he knew everything and there were no limitation to human cognition. <span class="cmt_word">A man cannot tell what shall be</span>. And yet, or although, no man can really predict the future. The fool speaks confidently of such things, and thereby proves his imbecility. Instead of "what shall be," the Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "What has been and what shall be;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid ante se fuerit</span>, "What has been before him." This reading was introduced probably to obviate a seeming tautology in the following clause, <span class="cmt_word">And what shall be after him, who can tell?</span> But this clause has a different signification from the former, and presents a closer definition. The future intended may be the result of the fool's inconsiderate language, which may have fatal and lasting consequences; or it may refer to the visitation of his sins upon his children, in accordance with the denunciation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20-22</a>; or it may include the life beyond the grave.

The babbler's tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison; and contradiction only makes it the more violent. We must find the way to keep him gentle. But by rash, unprincipled, or slanderous talk, he brings open or secret vengeance upon himself. Would we duly consider our own ignorance as to future events, it would cut off many idle words which we foolishly multiply. Fools toil a great deal to no purpose. They do not understand the plainest things, such as the entrance into a great city. But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city, that it is a high-way, in which the simplest wayfaring men shall not err, Isa 25:8. But sinful folly makes men miss that only way to happiness.</body></html>
