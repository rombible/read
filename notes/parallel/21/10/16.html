Koheleth returns to the theme mentioned in vers. 4-7. and speaks <span class="accented">of folly in one who holds the position of king, and the need of wisdom and prudence in the subjects of an unworthy ruler</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child</span>! "Child" is <span class="accented">naar</span>, which term included any age up to manhood. Some interpret the word here, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in Greek, in the sense of "slave," contrasting it with "the son of nobles" in the following verse. But it can hardly signify more than servitor, attendant; and in ver. 7 the antithesis to "prince" is <span class="accented">ebed</span>, not <span class="accented">naar</span>. The child in the present case is a youthful, inexperienced ruler, who does not realize his responsibilities, and is the tool of evil advisers. What particular instance, if any, Koheleth had in view it is impossible to say. Of course, many expositors see a reference to Rehoboam. whom, at forty years of age, his own son Abijah calls <span class="accented">naar</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>), and who was certainly childish in his conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-14</a>). Hitzig connects the passage with the reign of Ptolemy Epiphanes, who was but five years old at the death of his father, <span class="date">B.C. 205</span>, the reins of government being assumed by Agathocles and his sister Agathoclea, who occasioned serious disasters to the laud. To support this opinion, the date of our book has to be considerably reduced (see Introduction). It is best to take the gnome as a general expression, like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>, "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them." <span class="cmt_word">Thy princes eat in the morning.</span> Eating here implies feasting and banqueting, beginning the day with sensual enjoyment instead of such honest work as attending to state matters, administering justice, etc., as becomes good rulers. None but profligates would thus spend the early morning. "These are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day," says St. Peter, repudiating the charge of intoxication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>). "Woe unto them," cries Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>), "that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink!" Even the heathen censured such debauchery. Cicero thus abuses Antonius: "At quam multos dies in ea villa turpissime es per-bacchatus. Ab hora tertia bibebatur, ludebatur, vomebatur" ('Philipp.,' 2:41). Curtius (5. 7. 2) reprehends" de die convivia inire." The Greeks had a proverb to denote abnormal sensuality, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:16-20 The happiness of a land depends on the character of its rulers. The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish, and lovers of pleasure. Slothfulness is of ill consequence both to private and public affairs. Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe, though it answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to be had, may generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. His ear is ever open. Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought. Your curses cannot affect Him; but his curse, coming down upon you, will sink you to the lowest hell.</body></html>
