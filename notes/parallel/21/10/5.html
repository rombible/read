The evil which he noticed appeared to be (he does not affirm that it is) a mistake caused by the ruler; it so presented itself to his mind. The caution observed in the statement may be owing partly to the tacit feeling that such blots occasioned difficulties in the view taken of the moral government of the world. He does not intend to refer to God under the appellation "Ruler." The Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "As if it came involuntarily;" Vulgate, to much the same effect, <span class="accented">Quasi per errorem egrediens</span>. The idea here is either gnat the evil is one not produced by any intentional action of the ruler, but resulting from human imperfection, or that what appears to be a mistake is not so really. But these interpretations are unsuitable. Those who adhere to the Solomonic authorship of our book see here a prophetic intimation of the evil of Jeroboam's rule, which evil proceeded from the sins of Solomon himself and his son Rehoboam. (So Wordsworth, Motais, etc.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:4-10 Solomon appears to caution men not to seek redress in a hasty manner, nor to yield to pride and revenge. Do not, in a passion, quit thy post of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yielding pacifies great offences. Men are not preferred according to their merit. And those are often most forward to offer help, who are least aware of the difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark is applied to the church, or the body of Christ, that all the members should have the same care one for another.</body></html>
