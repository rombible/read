For the latter sense, however, there is countenance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-4.htm" title="And when you are come in, you shall shut the door on you and on your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.">2Kings 4:4</a>, where the word is translated "set aside."<p><span class= "bld">Cleaveth wood.--</span>Or, <span class= "ital">cutteth down trees, </span>an operation not free from danger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm" title="As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the helve, and lights on his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee to one of those cities, and live:">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith</span>. It is natural to consider this clause as suggested by the breaking of a wall in the preceding verse; but as this would occasion a jejune repetition, it is better to take it of the work of the quarryman, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>, where the same verb is used. The dangers to which such laborers are exposed are well known. Here, again, but unsuccessfully, some have seen a reference to the removal of landmarks, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4</a>, where the word is translated "set aside." As before said, the paragraph does not speak of retribution, but advises caution, enforcing the lesson by certain homely, allusions to the accidents that may occur m customary occupations. <span class="cmt_word">He that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</span> Cutting up logs of wood, a man may hurt himself with axe or saw, or be injured by splinters, etc. If we take the idea to be the felling of trees, there is the danger of being crushed in their fall, or, according to the tenor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>, of being killed inadvertently by a neighbor's axe. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui scindit ligna vulnerabitur ab eis</span>, which is more definite than the general term "endangered;" but the Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the Authorized Version. Plumptre sees here, again, an intimation of the danger of attacking time-honored institutions, even when decaying and corrupt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:4-10 Solomon appears to caution men not to seek redress in a hasty manner, nor to yield to pride and revenge. Do not, in a passion, quit thy post of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yielding pacifies great offences. Men are not preferred according to their merit. And those are often most forward to offer help, who are least aware of the difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark is applied to the church, or the body of Christ, that all the members should have the same care one for another.</body></html>
