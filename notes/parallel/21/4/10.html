If one or the other fall, the companion will aid him. The idea is that two travelers are making their way over a rough road - an experience that every one must have had in Palestine. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si unus ceciderit</span>. Of course, if both fell at the same time, one could not help the other. Commentators quote Homer, 'Iliad,' 10:220-226, thus rendered by Lord Derby - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Nestor, that heart is mine;<br />I dare alone Enter the hostile camp, so close at hand;<br />Yet were one comrade giv'n me, I should go<br />With more of comfort, more of confidence.<br />Where two combine, one before other sees<br />The better course; and ev'n though one alone<br />The readiest way discover, yet would be<br />His judgment slower, his decision less."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Woe to him that is alone</span>.

The verse may be applied to moral falls as well as to stumbling at natural obstacles. Brother helps brother to resist temptation, while many have failed when tried by isolation who would have manfully withstood if they had had the countenance and support of others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Clear before us through the darkness<br />Gleams and burns the guiding light;<br />Brother clasps the hand of brother,<br />Stepping fearless through the night."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-12 Surely he has more satisfaction in life, who labours hard to maintain those he loves, than the miser has in his toil. In all things union tends to success and safety, but above all, the union of Christians. They assist each other by encouragement, or friendly reproof. They warm each other's hearts while they converse together of the love of Christ, or join in singing his praises. Then let us improve our opportunities of Christian fellowship. In these things all is not vanity, though there will be some alloy as long as we are under the sun. Where two are closely joined in holy love and fellowship, Christ will by his Spirit come to them; then there is a threefold cord.</body></html>
