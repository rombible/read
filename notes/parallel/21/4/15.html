yet his great popularity was but temporary, and the next generation took no pleasure in him." It seems to me that by no stretch of rhetoric can "all the living which walk under the sun" be taken for the subjects of the sovereign in question. I am inclined to think that the Preacher reverts to the general topic, and considered all the living with the "second youth," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the second generation which shall succeed them. He saw the old generation hardened in its ways, and incapable of being admonished, and then displaced by a new generation, with which the next will feel equal dissatisfaction.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I considered all the living which walk under the sun</span>; or, <span class="accented">I have seen</span> all the population. The expression is hyperbolical, as Eastern monarchs speak of their dominions as if they comprised the whole world (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span> "With" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) means "in company with," "on the side of;" and the clause should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">That they were with the youth</span>, <span class="accented">the second</span>, <span class="accented">that stood up in his stead</span>. The youth who is called the second is the one spoken of in the previous verses, who by general acclamation is raised to the highest place in the realm, while the old monarch is dethroned or depreciated. He is named <span class="accented">second</span>, as being the successor of the other, either in popular favor or on the throne. It is the old story of worshipping the rising sun. The verse may still be applied to Joseph, who was made second to Pharaoh, and was virtually supreme in Egypt, standing in the king's place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-44</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:13-16 People are never long easy and satisfied; they are fond of changes.
