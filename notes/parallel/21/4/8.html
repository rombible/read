or, <span class="accented">without a second</span> - a solitary being, without partner, relation, or friend. Here, he says, is another instance of man's inability to secure his own happiness. Wealth indeed, is supposed to make friends, such as they are; but miserliness and greed separate a man from his fellows, make him suspicious of every one, and drive him to live alone, churlish and unhappy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he hath neither child nor brother</span>; no one to share his wealth, or for whom to save and amass riches. To apply these words to Solomon himself, who had brothers, and one son, if not more, is manifestly inappropriate. They may possibly refer to some circumstance in the writer's own life; but of that we know nothing. <span class="cmt_word">Yet is there no sad of all his labor</span>. In spite of this isolation he plies his weary task, and ceases not to hoard. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is his eye satisfied with riches</span>; so that he is content with what he has (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). The insatiable thirst for gold, the dropsy of the mind, is a commonplace theme in classical writers. Thus Horace, 'Caxm.,' 3:16. 17 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam, Majorumque fames."</span> And Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:138 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum turget sacculus ore,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crevit."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Neither, saith he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good?</span> The original is more dramatic than the Authorized Version or the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec recogitat</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>, <span class="accented">Cui laboro</span>, etc.? The writer suddenly puts himself in the place of the friendless miser, and exclaims, "And for whom do I labor," etc.? We see something similar in ver. 15 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>. Here we cannot find any definite allusion to the writer's own circumstances. The clause is merely a lively personification expressive of strong sympathy with the situation described (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>). <span class="accented">Good</span> may mean either riches, in which case the denial to the soul refers to the enjoyment which wealth might afford, or happiness and comfort. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "goodness," "kindness " - which gives quite a different and not so suitable an idea. <span class="cmt_word">Sore travail</span>; a sad business, a woeful employment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7,8 Frequently, the more men have, the more they would have; and on this they are so intent, that they get no enjoyment from what they have. Selfishness is the cause of this evil. A selfish man cares for nobody; there is none to take care of but himself, yet he will scarcely allow necessary rest to himself, and the people he employs. He never thinks he has enough. He has enough for his calling, for his family, but he has not enough for his eyes. Many are so set upon the world, that in pursuit of it they bereave themselves, not only of the favour of God and eternal life, but of the pleasures of this life. The distant relations or strangers who inherit such a man's wealth, never thank him. Covetousness gathers strength by time and habit; men tottering on the brink of the grave, grow more grasping and griping. Alas, and how often do we see men professing to be followers of Him, who, though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, anxiously scraping money together and holding it fast, excusing themselves by common-place talking about the necessity of care, and the danger of extravagance!</body></html>
