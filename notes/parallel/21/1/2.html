In using this expression we mean to indicate the opinion that the unity of the book is rather that of a musical composition than of a philosophical treatise. A leading theme is given out and followed for a time. Episodes are introduced, not perhaps logically connected with the original subject, but treated in harmony with it, and leading back to the original theme which is never lost sight of, and with which the composition comes to a close (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm" title="Vanity of vanities, said the preacher; all is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>).<p>The word translated "vanity" (which occurs thirty-seven times in this book, and only thirty-three times in all the rest of the Old Testament) in its primary meaning denotes breath or vapour, and is so translated here in some of the Greek versions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>); so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm" title="When you cry, let your companies deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that puts his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;">Isaiah 57:13</a>. It is the same word as the proper name Abel, on which see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-2.htm" title="And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.">Genesis 4:2</a>. It is frequently applied in Scripture to the follies of heathenism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm" title="Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? are not you he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait on you: for you have made all these things.">Jeremiah 14:22</a>, &c), and also to the whole estate of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/39-5.htm" title="Behold, you have made my days as an handbreadth; and my age is as nothing before you: truly every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.">Psalm 39:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm" title="Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.">Psalm 62:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm" title="Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passes away.">Psalm 144:4</a>). The translation "vanity<span class= "ital">" </span>is that of the LXX. We may reasonably believe that St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,">Romans 8:20</a>) had this key-note of Ecclesiastes in his mind.<p>"Vanity of vanities" is a common Hebrew superlative, as in the phrases "Heaven of heavens," "Song of songs," "Holy of holies," "Lamentation of lamentations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm" title="In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he has changed the portion of my people: how has he removed it from me! turning away he has divided our fields.">Micah 2:4</a>, margin).<p><span class= "bld">Saith the Preacher.--</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">said. </span>The Hebrew constantly employs the preterite when English usage requires the present or perfect. In the case of a message the point of time contemplated in Hebrew is that of the giving, not the delivery, of the message. So "Thus said Benhadad," "Thus said the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-2.htm" title="And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus said Benhadad,">1Kings 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-5.htm" title="And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;">1Kings 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-13.htm" title="And, behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am the LORD.">1Kings 20:13</a> and <span class= "ital">passim</span>) are rightly translated by the present in our version. In the present case this formula is one which might conceivably be employed if the words of Koheleth were written down by himself; yet it certainly rather suggests that we have here these words as written down by another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-11.</span> - PROLOGUE. The vanity of all human and mundane things, and the oppressive monotony of their continued recurrence. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vanity of vanities, saith the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>). "Vanity" is <span class="accented">hebel</span>, which means "breath," and is used metaphorically of anything transitory, frail, unsatisfying. We have it in the proper name Abel, an appropriate designation of the youth whose life was cut short by a brother's murderous hand. "Vanity of vanities," like "heaven of heavens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), "song of songs" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-1.htm">Song of Solomon 1:1</a>), etc., is equivalent to a superlative, "most utterly vain." It is here an exclamation, and is to be regarded as the key-note of the whole subsequent treatise, which is merely the development of this text. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; other Greek translators, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "vapor of vapors." For "saith" the Vulgate gives <span class="accented">dixit</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; but as there is no reference to any previous utterance of the Preacher, the present is more suitable here. In affirming that "all is vanity," the writer is referring to human and mundane things, and directs not his view beyond such phenomena. Such reflection is common in sacred and profane writings alike; such experience is universal (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-3.htm">Psalm 90:3-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14</a>). "Pulvis et umbra sumus," says Horace ('Carm.,' 4:7. 16. "O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!" (Persius, 'Sat.,' 1:1). If Dean Plumptre is correct in contending that the Book of Wisdom was written to rectify the deductions which might be drawn from Koheleth, we may contrast the caution of the apocryphal writer, who predicates vanity, not of all things, but only of the hope of the ungodly, which he likens to dust, froth, and smoke (see Wisd. 2:1, etc.; 5:14). St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>) seems to have had Ecclesiastes in mind when he spoke of the creation being subjected to vanity (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), as a consequence of the fall of man, not to be remedied till the final restitution of all things. "But a man will say, If all things are vain and vanity, wherefore were they made? If they are God's works, how are they vain? But it is not the works of God which he calls vain. God forbid! The heaven is not vain; the earth is not vain: God forbid! Nor the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor our own body. No; all these are very good. But what is vain? Man's works, pomp, and vain-glory. These came not from the hand of God, but are of our own creating. And they are vain because they have no useful end That is called vain which is expected indeed to possess value, yet possesses it not; that which men call empty, as when they speak of 'empty hopes,' and that which is fruitless. And generally that is called vain which is of no use. Let us see, then, whether all human things are not of this sort" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hem. 12. in Ephes.'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 Much is to be learned by comparing one part of Scripture with another. We here behold Solomon returning from the broken and empty cisterns of the world, to the Fountain of living water; recording his own folly and shame, the bitterness of his disappointment, and the lessons he had learned. Those that have taken warning to turn and live, should warn others not to go on and die. He does not merely say all things are vain, but that they are vanity. VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY. This is the text of the preacher's sermon, of which in this book he never loses sight. If this world, in its present state, were all, it would not be worth living for; and the wealth and pleasure of this world, if we had ever so much, are not enough to make us happy. What profit has a man of all his labour? All he gets by it will not supply the wants of the soul, nor satisfy its desires; will not atone for the sins of the soul, nor hinder the loss of it: what profit will the wealth of the world be to the soul in death, in judgment, or in the everlasting state?</body></html>
