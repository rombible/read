The word itself is common in Rabbinical Hebrew, in the sense of business.<p>"To afflict them" (margin). This is too strong a translation; better, <span class= "ital">to travail therein.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave my heart</span> (ver. 17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>). The heart, in the Hebrew conception, was the seat, not of the affections only, but of the understanding and intellectual faculties generally. So the expression here is equivalent to "I applied my mind." <span class="cmt_word">To seek and search out.</span> The two words are not synonymous. The former verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">darash</span>) implies penetrating into the depth of an object before one; the other word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">tur</span>) taking a comprehensive survey of matters further away; so that two methods and scopes of investigation are signified. <span class="cmt_word">By wisdom</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (Septuagint). Wisdom was the means or instrument by which he carried on his researches, which were directed, not merely to the collecting of facts, but to investigating the causes and conditions of things. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning all things that are done under heaven</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. men's actions and conduct, political, social, and private life. We have "under the sun" in ver. 9, and again in ver. 14. Here there is no question of physical matters, the phenomena of the material world, but only of human circumstances and interests. <span class="cmt_word">This sore travail</span> (rather, <span class="accented">this is a sore travail that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>God hath given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith</span>. The word rendered "travail" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">inyan</span>) occurs often in this book (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:23, 26</a>, etc.), and nowhere else in the Old Testament. The same root is found in the word translated "exercised;" hence Wright has, "It is a woeful exercise which God has given to the sons of men wherewith to exercise themselves." If we <span class="accented">keep</span> to the word "travail," we may render, "to travail <span class="accented">therein</span>." It implies distracting business, engrossing occupation. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">occupationem</span>. Man feels himself constrained to make this laborious investigation, yet the result is most unsatisfactory, as the next verse shows. "God" is here <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and so throughout the book, the name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (the God of the covenant, the God of Israel) never once occurring. Those who regard Solomon as the author of the book account for this on the plea that the king, in his latest years, reflecting sadly on his backsliding and fall, shrank from uttering with his polluted lips the adorable Name once so often used with filial reverence and beloved. But the true reason is found in the design of Koheleth, which was to set forth, not so much Israel's position under the covenant, as the condition of man in the face of the God of nature. The idiosyncrasies and peculiar features of the chosen people are not the subject of his essay; he deals with a wider sphere; his theme is man in his relation to Divine providence; and for this power he uses that name, common alike to the true and false religions, <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, applied to the Supreme Being by believers and idolaters. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity. He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn. Let us learn to hate and fear sin, the cause of all this vanity and misery; to value Christ; to seek rest in the knowledge, love, and service of the Saviour.</body></html>
