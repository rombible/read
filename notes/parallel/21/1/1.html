The word rendered "Preacher" is <span class="accented">Koheleth</span>, a feminine noun formed from a verb <span class="accented">kalal</span>, "to call" (see Introduction, &sect; 1), and perhaps better rendered" Convener" or "Debater." It is found nowhere else but in this book, where it occurs three times in this chapter (vers. 1, 2, 12), three times in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8, 9, 10</a>, and once in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>. In all but one instance (viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>) it is used without the article, as a proper name. Jerome, in his commentary, translates it, 'Continuator,' in his version 'Ecclesiastes.' It would seem to denote one who gathered around him a congregation in order to instruct them in Divine lore. The feminine form is explained in various ways. Either it is used abstractedly, as the designation of an office, which it seems not to be; or it is formed as some other words which are found with a feminine termination, though denoting the names of men, indicating, as Gesenius notes (&sect; 107, 3. 100.), a high degree of activity in the possessor of the particular quality signified by the stem; e.g. Alemeth, Azmaveth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-42.htm">1 Chronicles 9:42</a>), Pochereth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-57.htm">Ezra 2:57</a>), Sophereth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-57.htm">Nehemiah 7:57</a>); or, as is most probable, the writer desired to identify Koheleth with Wisdom, though it must be observed that the personality of the author often appears, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a>, etc.; the <span class="accented">role</span> of Wisdom being for the nonce forgotten. The word "king" in the title is shown by the accentuation to be in apposition to "Koheleth" not to "David;" and there can be no doubt that the description is intended to denote Solomon, though his name is nowhere actually given, as it is in the two other works ascribed to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-1.htm">Song of Solomon 1:1</a>). Other intimations of the assumption of Solomon's personality are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:12</a>, "I Koheleth was king," etc.; so in describing his consummate wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a>), and in his being the author of many proverbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:9</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32</a>) - accomplishments which are not noted in the case of any other of David's descendants. Also the picture of luxury and magnificence presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2</a>. suits no Jewish monarch but Solomon. The origin of the name applied to him may probably be traced to the historical fact mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55</a>, etc., where Solomon gathers all Israel together to the dedication of the temple, and utters the remarkable prayer which contained blessing and teaching and exhortation. As we have shown in the Introduction (&sect; 2), the assumption of the name is a mere literary device to give weight and importance to the treatise to which it appertains. The term, "King in Jerusalem," or, as in ver. 12, "King over Israel in Jerusalem," is unique, and occurs nowhere else in Scripture. David is said to have reigned in Jerusalem, when this seat of government is spoken of in contrast with that at Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>), and the same expression is used of Solomon, Rehoboam, and others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-42.htm">1 Kings 11:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2, 10</a>); and the phrase probably denotes a time when the government had become divided, and Israel had a different capital from Judah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 Much is to be learned by comparing one part of Scripture with another. We here behold Solomon returning from the broken and empty cisterns of the world, to the Fountain of living water; recording his own folly and shame, the bitterness of his disappointment, and the lessons he had learned. Those that have taken warning to turn and live, should warn others not to go on and die. He does not merely say all things are vain, but that they are vanity. VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY. This is the text of the preacher's sermon, of which in this book he never loses sight. If this world, in its present state, were all, it would not be worth living for; and the wealth and pleasure of this world, if we had ever so much, are not enough to make us happy. What profit has a man of all his labour? All he gets by it will not supply the wants of the soul, nor satisfy its desires; will not atone for the sins of the soul, nor hinder the loss of it: what profit will the wealth of the world be to the soul in death, in judgment, or in the everlasting state?</body></html>
