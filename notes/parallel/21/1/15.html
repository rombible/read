So likewise "that which is wanting" is peculiar to this passage, and to later Hebrew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which is crooked cannot be made straight</span>. This is intended as a confirmation of ver. 14. By the utmost exercise of his powers and faculties man cannot change the course of events; he is constantly met by anomalies which he can neither explain nor rectify (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>). The above is probably a proverbial saying. Knobel quotes Suidas: <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate takes the whole maxim as applying only to morals: "Perverse men are hardly corrected, and the number of tools is infinite." So too the Syriac and Targum. The Septuagint rightly as the Authorized Version. The writer is not referring merely to man's sins and delinquencies, but to the perplexities in which he finds himself involved, and extrication from which is impracticable. <span class="cmt_word">That which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "loss, defect," is <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the Old Testament. We cannot reckon where there is nothing to count; no skill in arithmetic will avail to make up for a substantial deficit. So nothing man can do is able to remedy the anomalies by which he is surrounded, or to supply the defects which are pressed upon his notice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity. He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn. Let us learn to hate and fear sin, the cause of all this vanity and misery; to value Christ; to seek rest in the knowledge, love, and service of the Saviour.</body></html>
