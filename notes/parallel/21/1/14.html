This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm" title="Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm" title="Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-9.htm" title="Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 6:9</a>). The A. V. translation, "vexation of spirit," is difficult to justify. Very nearly the same phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm" title="Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind: he daily increases lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.">Hosea 12:1</a>, and is there translated "feeding on wind," for in Hebrew, as in some other languages, the name for "spirit" primarily denotes breath or wind. Accordingly many interpreters understand the phrase of the text "feeding on wind" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-20.htm" title="He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?">Isaiah 44:20</a>). The same root, however, which means to "feast on a thing," has the secondary meaning to "delight in a thing," and so the corresponding noun in Chaldee comes to mean "pleasure" or "will." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm" title="Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.">Ezra 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-18.htm" title="And whatever shall seem good to you, and to your brothers, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.">Ezra 7:18</a>.) Accordingly the LXX. and many modern interpreters understand the phrase of the text "effort after wind."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Here is the result of this examination of human actions. <span class="cmt_word">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun.</span> In his varied experience nothing had escaped his notice. <span class="cmt_word">And behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit</span>; <span class="accented">reuth ruach</span>; <span class="accented">afflictio spiritus</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "choice of spirit," or, "wind" (Septuagint); <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Aquila and Theodotion); <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "feeding on wind" (Symmachus). This last translation, or "striving after wind," seems to be most agreeable to the etymology of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, which, except in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11, 17, 26</a>, etc.), occurs elsewhere only in the Chaldee portion of Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm">Ezra 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-18.htm">Ezra 7:18</a>). Whichever sense is taken, the import is much the same. What is implied is the unsubstantial and unsatisfying nature of human labors and endeavors. Many compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>, "Ephraim feedeth on wind," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-20.htm">Isaiah 44:20</a>, "He feedeth on ashes." In contrast, perhaps, to this constantly recurring complaint, the author of the Book of Wisdom teaches that murmuring is unprofitable and blasphemous (Wisd. 1:11). Bailey, in 'Festus,' sings - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Of all life's aims, what's worth the thought we waste on't?<br />How mean, how miserable, seems every care!<br />How doubtful, too, the system of the mind!<br />And then the ceaseless, changeless, hopeless round<br />Of weariness, and heartlessness, and woe,<br />And vice, and vanity! Yet these make life -<br />The life, at least, I witness, if not feel<br />No matter, we are immortal."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity. He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn. Let us learn to hate and fear sin, the cause of all this vanity and misery; to value Christ; to seek rest in the knowledge, love, and service of the Saviour.</body></html>
