The verse gains in liveliness if more literally rendered, "going towards the south and circling towards the north, circling, circling goes the wind, and to its circles the wind returns."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;</span> literally, <span class="accented">going towards the south</span>, <span class="accented">and circling towards the north</span>. These words, as we have seen above, are referred to the sun by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac; but it is best to make this verse refer only to the wind - a fresh example of motion continually repeated with no real progress to an end. Thus each verse comprises one subject and idea, ver. 4 being concerned with the earth, ver. 5 with the sun, ver. 6 with the wind, and ver. 7 with the waters. There seems to be no particular force in the naming of north and south, unless it be in contrast to the sun's motion from east to west, mentioned in the preceding verse. The words following show that these two directions are not alone intended. Thus the four quarters are virtually included. <span class="cmt_word">It whirleth about continually.</span> The original is more forcible, giving by its very form the idea of weary monotony. The subject is delayed till the last, thus: <span class="accented">Going towards the south</span>... <span class="accented">circling</span>, <span class="accented">circling</span>, <span class="accented">goeth the wind</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. it blows from all quarters at its own caprice. <span class="cmt_word">And the wind returneth again according to his circuits</span>. <span class="accented">And on its circlings returneth the wind</span>; it comes back to the point whence it started. The wind, seemingly the freest of all created things, is bound by the same law of immutable changeableness, insensate repetition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-8 All things change, and never rest. Man, after all his labour, is no nearer finding rest than the sun, the wind, or the current of the river. His soul will find no rest, if he has it not from God. The senses are soon tired, yet still craving what is untried.</body></html>
