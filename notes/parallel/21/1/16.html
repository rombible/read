The expression suggests, as it were, an internal dialogue, as the Greek Venetian puts it, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lo, I am come to great estate.</span> If this be taken by itself, it makes Koheleth speak of his power and majesty first, and of his progress in wisdom afterwards; but it is best to connect it with what follows, and to confine the clause to one idea; thus: "I have obtained great and ever greater wisdom" - I have continually added to my stores of knowledge and experience. <span class="cmt_word">Than all they</span> (<span class="accented">above all</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that have been before me in</span> (<span class="accented">over</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Jerusalem</span>. Who are the rulers alluded to? Solomon himself was only the second of the Israelite kings who reigned there; of the Canaanite princes who may have made that their capital, we have no knowledge, nor is R likely that Solomon would compare himself with them. The Targum has altered the approved reading, and gives, "Above all the wise men that were in Jerusalem before me." The reading, "in [instead of 'over'] Jerusalem," has indeed some manuscript authority, and is confirmed by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac, but it is evidently a correction of the text by critics who saw the difficulty of the authorized wording. Motais and others assert that the preposition in the Masoretic text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">all</span>, often means "in," as well as "over," when the reference is to an elevated spot; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>. But even granting this, we are still uncertain who are the persons meant. Commentators point to Melchizedek, Adonizedek, and Araunah among rulers, and to Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>) among sages. But we know nothing of the wisdom of the former, and there is no tangible reason why the latter should be designated "before me in Jerusalem." Doubtless the words point to a succession of kings who had reigned in Jerusalem, and the writer, involuntarily, perhaps, betrays his assumed character, in relying an excusable anachronism, while giving to the personated monarch a position which could not belong to the historical Solomon. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, my heart had great experience of</span> (<span class="accented">hath seen abundantly</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;</span> Venetian) <span class="cmt_word">wisdom and knowledge</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> used adverbially qualifies the word before it, "hath seen." The heart, as we have observed (ver. 13), is considered the seat of the intellectual life. In saying that the heart hath seen wisdom, the writer means that his mind has taken it in, apprehended and appropriated it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>). <span class="accented">Wisdom and knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">chokmah</span> and <span class="accented">daath</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint), the former regarding the ethical and practical side, the latter the speculative, which leads to the other (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-6.htm">Isaiah 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity. He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn. Let us learn to hate and fear sin, the cause of all this vanity and misery; to value Christ; to seek rest in the knowledge, love, and service of the Saviour.</body></html>
