Taking the text as it stands, it means to know wisdom and knowledge fully by a study of their contraries. The word for "madness" is peculiar to this book, but the corresponding verb occurs frequently in other books.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I gave my heart</span>. He reiterates the expression in order to emphasize his earnestness and energy in the pursuit of wisdom. And knowing, as St. Jerome says, that "contrariis contraria inteiliguntur," he studies the opposite of wisdom, and learns the truth by contrasting it with error. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">to know madness and folly</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>). The former word, <span class="accented">holeloth</span> (intensive plural), by its etymology points to a confusion of thought, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. an unwisdom which deranges all ideas of order and propriety; and folly (hero <span class="accented">sikluth</span>), throughout the sapiential books, is identified with vice and wickedness, the contradictory of practical godliness. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "parables and knowledge," and some editors have altered the Hebrew text in accordance with this version, which they consider more suitable to the context. But Koheleth's standpoint is quite consistent. To use the words of St. Jerome in his 'Commentary,' "AEqualis studii fuit Salomoni, scire sapientiam et scientiam, et e regione errores et stultitiam, ut in aliis appetendis et aliis declinandis vera ejus sapientia probaretur." On the other hand, Den-Sirs gives a much-needed warning against touching pitch (Ecclus. 13:1), and argues expressly that "the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom" (Ecclus. 19:22). Plumptre unnecessarily sees in the use of the term" madness 'an echo of the teaching of the Stoics, who regarded men's weaknesses as forms of insanity. The moralist had no need to travel beyond his own experience in order to learn that sin was the acme of unwisdom, a declension from reason which might well be called madness. The subject is handled by Cicero, 'Tusc. Disput.,' 3:4, 5. We are reminded of Horace's expression ('Carm.,' 2:7. 27) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Recepto Dulce mihi furere est amico."</span> And Anacreon's (31.), <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Thus far we have had Koheleth's secret thoughts - what he communed with his own heart (ver. 16). The result of his studies was most unsatisfying <span class="cmt_word">I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit</span>; or, <span class="accented">a striving after wind</span>, as ver. 14 Though the word is somewhat different. As such labor is wasted, for man cannot control issues. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity. He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit.
