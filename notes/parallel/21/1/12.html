Solomon, in this book called Koheleth, pre-eminent among Jewish sovereigns as well for wisdom as for temporal prosperity, speaking in the first person, tells how, with all his advantages, he could secure in this life no lasting or satisfying happiness. He relates first how he found no satisfaction from an enlightened survey of human life. He found (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm" title="I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>) that it presented a scene of laborious exertion empty of profitable results. His researches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm" title="That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>) only brought to light errors and defects which it was impossible to remedy; so that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm" title="For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>) the more thought a man bestowed on the subject, the greater his grief. On the name Koheleth, and the phrase "was king," see Introduction.<p><span class= "bld">Over Israel.</span>--King <span class= "ital">of </span>Israel is the usual phrase in the earlier books, but there are examples of that here employed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm" title="And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.">1Samuel 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-23.htm" title="Therefore the king said to Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore to him.">2Samuel 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-37.htm" title="And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.">1Kings 11:37</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>. - Division. I. PROOF OF THE VANITY OF EARTHLY THINGS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND GENERAL OBSERVATION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - Section 1. <span class="accented">Vanity of striving for wisdom and knowledge</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem</span>. Koheleth relates his own experience as king, in accordance with his assumption of the person of Solomon. The use of the past tense in this verse is regarded by many as strong evidence against the Solomonic authorship of the book. "I have been king" (not "I have become king," as Gratz would translate) is a statement introducing the supposed speaker, not as a reigning monarch, but as one who, in time past, exercised sovereignty. Solomon is represented as speaking from the grave, and recalling the past for the instruction of his auditors. In a similar manner, the author of the Book of Wisdom (8:1-13) speaks in his impersonation of Solomon. That king himself, who reigned without interruption to his death, could not have spoken of himself in the terms used here. He lost neither his throne nor his power; and, therefore, the expression cannot be paralleled (as Mr. Bullock suggests) by the complaint of Louis XIV., unsuccessful in war and weary of rule, "When I was king." Solomon <span class="accented">redivivus</span> is introduced to give weight to the succeeding experiences. Here is one who had every and the most favorable opportunity of seeing the best side of things; and yet his testimony is that all is vanity. In the acquisition of wisdom, the contrast between the advantage of learned leisure and the interruptions of a laborious life is set forth in Ecclus. 38:24, etc. <span class="accented">King over Israel</span>. The expression indicates a time before the division of the kingdom. We have it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>, and occasionally elsewhere. The usual phrase is "King of Israel." (For <span class="accented">in Jerusalem</span>, see on ver. 1.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity. He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn. Let us learn to hate and fear sin, the cause of all this vanity and misery; to value Christ; to seek rest in the knowledge, love, and service of the Saviour.</body></html>
