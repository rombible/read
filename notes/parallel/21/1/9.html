Justin Martyr (<span class= "ital">Apol. i.</span> 57) has what looks like a reminiscence of this verse; but we cannot rely on it to prove his acquaintance with the book, the same idea being found in Grecian philosophy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be.</span> The LXX. and the Vulgate render the first clauses of the two parts of the verse in both cases interrogatively, thus: "What is that which hath been? The very thing which shall be. And what is that which hath been done? The very thing which shall be done." What has been affirmed of phenomena in the material world is now affirmed of the events of man's life. They move in an analogous circle, whether they are concerned with actions or morals. Plumptre sees here an anticipation or a reproduction of the Stoic doctrine of a recurring cycle of events, such as Viral mentions in his fourth 'Eclogue' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo," etc.</span> But Koheleth is speaking merely from experience, and is indulging in no philosophical speculations. There is <span class="cmt_word">no new thing under the sun</span>. The Vulgate transfers this clause to the next verso, which, indeed, supports the assertion. From classical authors commentators have culled examples of the same thought. Thus Tacitus, 'Annal.,' 3:55, "Nisi forte rebus cunctis inest quidam velut orbis, ut quem ad modum temporum vices, ita morum vertantur." Seneca, 'Epist.,' 24, "Nullius rei finis est, sod in orbem nexa sunt omnia; fugiunt ac sequuntur Omnia transeunt ut revertantur, nihil novi video, nihil novi facio. Fit ali-quando et hujus rei nausea." M. Aurelius, 'Medit.,' 6:37, "He that sees the present has seen all things, both that which has Been from everlasting and that which shall Be in the future. All things are of one birth and one form." Again, 7:1, "There is nothing new; all things are common and quickly over;" 12:26, "Everything that comes to pass was always so coming to pass, and will take place again." Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' 1:57, has, perhaps, a reminiscence of this passage when he writes, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-11 Men's hearts and their corruptions are the same now as in former times; their desires, and pursuits, and complaints, still the same. This should take us from expecting happiness in the creature, and quicken us to seek eternal blessings.
