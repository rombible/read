The italics with which our translators fill <span class= "ital">the </span>gap no doubt give the right sense. It may be mentioned that Ecclesiastes is characterised by a superfluous use of the pronoun "I" after the verb, just as if in Latin we constantly had, instead of "dixi," "dixi ego."

It is idle to quote the fact recorded by Josephus that Ptolemy Lagus secured the allegiance of his Jewish subjects by exacting an oath from them. This book has no connection with Egypt, and we need not look beyond the Bible for proof that an oath of vassalage was imposed on the Jews by their foreign masters, and that the breach of such an oath was regarded by the prophets as sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm" title="And has taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:">Ezekiel 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm" title="As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he shall die.">Ezekiel 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm" title="Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, see, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.">Ezekiel 17:18</a>). And there is reason to think that similar pledges had been given to native kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm" title="Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:">1Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-24.htm" title="And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.">1Chronicles 29:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God.

The pronoun <span class="accented">I</span> stands in the Hebrew without a verb (the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ego os regis observo</span>, is not warranted by the grammar of the clause), and some take it as the answer to the question in ver. 1, "Who is like the wise man?" I, who am now teaching you. But it is better to regard the pronoun as emphasizing the following rule, supplying some verb (which may possibly have dropped out of the text), as, "Say, advise - I, for my part, whatever others may do or advise, I counsel thee;" the injunction being given in the imperative mood. The Septuagint and Syriac omit the pronoun altogether. The warning implies that the writer was living under kingly, and indeed despotic, government, and it was the part of a wise man to exhibit cheerful obedience. Ben-Sira observes that wise men teach us how to serve great men (Ecclus. 8:8). Such conduct is not only prudent, but really a religious- duty, even as the prophets counsel submission to Assyrian and Chaldean rulers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>). The liege lord, being God's vicegerent, must be reverenced and obeyed. St. Paul, though he does not quote Ecclesiastes, may have had this passage in mind when he wrote (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God," etc.; and (ver. 5), "Ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake." The "king" in the text is understood by some to mean God, but the following clause renders this improbable, and it is wisdom in its political aspect that is here regarded. <span class="cmt_word">And that in regard of the oath of God.</span> The <span class="accented">ray</span> is explicative; "in regard of," or "because of," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a>. "The oath of God" is the oath of allegiance to the king, taken in the name of God, under his invocation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-43.htm">1 Kings 2:43</a>). So we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>) of a covenant between king and people, and people and king, in the time of Jehoiada; Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah swear by God to be his vassal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>); and Josephus ('Ant.,' 12:1; 11:8. 3) relates that Ptolemy Soter, son of Lagus (following herein the example of Darius), exacted an oath from the Jews in Egypt to be true to him and his successors. We know that both Babylonian and Persian monarchs exacted an oath of fealty from conquered nations, making them swear by the gods whom they worshipped, the selection of deities being left to them, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-5 None of the rich, the powerful, the honourable, or the accomplished of the sons of men, are so excellent, useful, or happy, as the wise man. Who else can interpret the words of God, or teach aright from his truths and dispensations? What madness must it be for weak and dependent creatures to rebel against the Almighty! What numbers form wrong judgments, and bring misery on themselves, in this life and that to come!</body></html>
