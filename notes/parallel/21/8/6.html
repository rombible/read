The first half of the verse repeats <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm" title="To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>; the second almost verbally <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm" title="There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>; on this account our translation "misery" is to be preferred to "wickedness" as some render it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. This and the three following clauses all begin with <span class="accented">ki</span>, "since," "for," and the conjunction ought to have been similarly rendered in all the places. Thus here, for <span class="cmt_word">to every purpose there is time and judgment</span>. Here commences a chain of argument to prove the wisdom of keeping quiet under oppression or evil rulers. Everything has its appointed time of duration, and in due course will be brought to judgment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1, 17</a>; 41:14). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (for) <span class="cmt_word">the misery of man is great upon him</span>. This is a further reason, but its exact signification is disputed. Literally, <span class="accented">the evil of the man is heavy upon him</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>). This may mean, as in the Authorized Version, that the affliction which subjects suffer at the hand of a tyrant becomes insupportable, and calls for and receives God's interposition. Or "the evil" may be the wickedness of the despot, which presses heavily upon him, and under retributive justice will ere long bring him to the ground, and so the oppression will come to an end. This seems to be the most natural interpretation of the passage. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "For the knowledge of a man is great upon him." Though what tiffs means it is difficult to say. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:6-8 God has, in wisdom, kept away from us the knowledge of future events, that we may be always ready for changes. We must all die, no flight or hiding-place can save us, nor are there any weapons of effectual resistance. Ninety thousand die every day, upwards of sixty every minute, and one every moment. How solemn the thought! Oh that men were wise, that they understood these things, that they would consider their latter end! The believer alone is prepared to meet the solemn summons. Wickedness, by which men often escape human justice, cannot secure from death.</body></html>
