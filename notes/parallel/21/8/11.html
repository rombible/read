<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, which connects the sentence with the allegation of vanity just preceding, as well as with what follows. <span class="accented">Pithgam</span>, "sentence," "edict," is a foreign word of Persian origin, found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-20.htm">Esther 1:20</a> and in Chaldee portions of Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>) and Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>, etc.). God seems to us to delay in punishing the guilty because we behold only one little portion of the course of his providence; could we take a more comprehensive view, anomalies would disappear, and we should see the end of these men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>). But a contracted, skeptical view leads to two evils - first, a weakening of faith in God's moral government; and second, a miserable fatalism which denies man's responsibility and saps his energy. Of the former of these results Koheleth here treats. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the heart of the sons of men.</span> The heart is named as the seat of thought and the prime mover of action (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is fully set in them to do evil</span>; literally, <span class="accented">is full in them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their heart becomes filled with thoughts which are directed to evil, or full of courage, hence "emboldened" (Revised Version margin) to do evil. Vulgate, <span class="accented">absque timore ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala</span>; Septuagint, "Because there is no contradiction (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) made on the part of (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) those who do evil speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully persuaded (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) in them to do evil." The long-suffering of God, instead of leading such men to repentance, hardens them in their infidelity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>). Primarily, the reference is still to tyrannical despots, who, in their seeming impunity, are em-boldened to pursue their evil course. But the statement is true generally. As Cicero says, "Quis ignorat maximam illecebram esse peccandi impunitatis spem?" ('Pro Milone,' 16.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:9-13 Solomon observed, that many a time one man rules over another to his hurt, and that prosperity hardens them in their wickedness. Sinners herein deceive themselves. Vengeance comes slowly, but it comes surely. A good man's days have some substance; he lives to a good purpose: a wicked man's days are all as a shadow, empty and worthless. Let us pray that we may view eternal things as near, real, and all-important.</body></html>
