These two considerations conduce to the old conclusion, that man had best enjoy life, only being careful to use it energetically and well. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - No mortal wisdom, combined with the closest observation and thought, can fathom the mysteries of God's moral government. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I applied mine heart</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>). The answering member of the sentence is in ver. 17, the last clause of the present verse being parenthetical. <span class="cmt_word">To know wisdom</span>. This was his first study (see on Ecclesiastes 1:16). He endeavored to acquire wisdom which might enable him to investigate God's doings. His second study was <span class="cmt_word">to see the business that is done upon the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only to learn what men do in their several stations and callings, but likewise to understand what all this means, what it tends to, its object and result. (For "business," <span class="accented">inyan</span>, see on Ecclesiastes 1:13.) The Vulgate here renders it <span class="accented">distentionem</span>, "distraction," which is like the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For also</span> there is that <span class="cmt_word">neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes</span>. This is a parenthetical clause expressing either the restless, unrelieved labor that goes on in the world, or the sleepless meditation of one who tries to solve the problem of the order and disorder in men's lives. In the latter case, Koheleth may be giving his own experience. To "see sleep" is to enjoy sleep. The phrase is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, but commentators quote parallels from classical sources. Thus Terence, 'Heautontim.,' 3:1.82 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Somnum hercle ego hac nocte cculis non vidi reels."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No sleep mine eyes have seen this livelong night."</span> Cicero, 'Ad Famil.,' 8:30, "Fuit mittflea vigilantia, qui tote sue consulatuson, hum non vidit." Of course, the expression is hyperbolical. The same idea is found without metaphor in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-17 Faith alone can establish the heart in this mixed scene, where the righteous often suffer, and the wicked prosper. Solomon commended joy, and holy security of mind, arising from confidence in God, because a man has no better thing under the sun, though a good man has much better things above the sun, than soberly and thankfully to use the things of this life according to his rank. He would not have us try to give a reason for what God does. But, leaving the Lord to clear up all difficulties in his own time, we may cheerfully enjoy the comforts, and bear up under the trials of life; while peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost will abide in us through all outward changes, and when flesh and heart shall fail.</body></html>
