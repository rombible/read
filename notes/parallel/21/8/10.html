Koheleth is troubled by apparent anomalies in God's moral government. He notes <span class="accented">the prosperity of the godless and the misery of the righteous</span>, God's abstention and the seeming impunity of sinners make men incredulous of Providence; but God is just in reward and punishment, as the end will prove. Meantime, returning to his old maxim, he advises men patiently to acquiesce in things as they are, and to make the best of life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And so</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>); then, in like manner, under the same circumstances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). The writer notes some apparent exceptions to the law of retribution of which he has just been speaking, the double particle at the beginning of the verse implying the connection with the preceding statement. <span class="cmt_word">I saw the wicked buried</span>. "The wicked" are especially the despots (ver. 9). These are carried to their graves with every outward honor and respect, like the rich man in the parable, who "died, and was buried" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>). Such men, if they had received their due reward, far from having a pompous and magnificent funeral (which would befit only a good and honored life), would have been buried with the burial of an ass (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). So far the Authorized Version is undeniably correct. What follows is as certainly inaccurate as it is unintelligible. <span class="cmt_word">Who had come and gone from the place of the holy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and they came, and from the place of the holy they went</span>. The first verb seems to mean, "they came to their rest," they died a natural death. The words, in themselves ambiguous, are explained by the connection in which they stand (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>). Wright renders, "they came into being," and explains it with the following clause, "they went away from the holy place," as one generation coming and another going, in constant succession. But if, as we suppose, the paragraph applies to the despot, such an interpretation is unsuitable. Cox's idea, that oppressive despots "come again" in the persons of their wicked children, is wholly unsupported by the text. The verse admits and has received a dozen explanations differing more or less from one another. A good deal depends upon the manner in which the succeeding clause is translated, <span class="cmt_word">And they were forgotten in the city where they had so done.</span> As the particle rendered "so" (<span class="accented">ken</span>) may also mean "well," "rightly," we get the rendering, "even such as acted justly," and thus introduce a contrast between the fate of the wicked man who is honored with a sumptuous funeral, and that of the righteous whose name is cast out as pollution and soon forgotten. So Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') gives, "And in accordance with this I have seen ungodly men honored, and that too in the holy place (the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), but those who had acted rightly had to depart, and were forgotten in the city." Against this interpretation, which has been adopted by many, it may reasonably be urged that in the same verse <span class="accented">ken</span> would hardly be used in two different senses, and that there is nothing in the text to indicate a change of subject. It seems to me that the whole verse applies to the wicked man. He dies in peace, he leaves the holy place; the evil that he has done is forgotten in the very city where he had so done, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> done wickedly. "The place of the holy" is Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>) or the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>). He is removed by death from that spot, the very name of which ought to have cried shame on his crimes and impiety. The expression seems to picture a great procession of priests and Levites accompanying the corpse of the deceased tyrant to the place of burial, while the final clause implies that no long lamentation was made over him, no monument erected to his memory (see the opposite of this in the treatment of Josiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>). They who consider "the righteous " to be the subject of the last clauses see in the words, "from the holy place they departed," an intimation that these were excommunicated from the synagogue or temple, or banished from the promised land, on account of their opinions. I would translate the passage thus: <span class="accented">In like manner have I seen the wicked buried, and they came to their rest, and they went from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city where they had so</span> (wickedly) acted. The versions have followed various readings. Thus the Septuagint: "And then I saw the impious brought unto graves, and from the holy place; and they departed and were praised in the city, because they had so done;" Vulgate, "I have seen the impious buried, who also, while they still lived, were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as if men of just doings." Commenting oh this version, St. Gregory writes, "The very tranquility of the peace of the Church conceals many under the Christian name who are beset with the plague of their own wickedness. But if a light breath of persecution strikes them, it sweeps them away at once as chaff from the threshing-floor. But some persons wish to bear the mark of Christian calling, because, since the name of Christ has been exalted on high, nearly all persons now look to appear faithful, and from seeing others called thus, they are ashamed not to seem faithful themselves; but they neglect to be that which they beast of being called. For they assume the reality of inward excellence, to adorn their outward appearance; and they who stand before the heavenly Judge, naked from the unbelief of their heart, are clothed, in the sight of men, with a holy profession, at least in words" ('Moral.,' 25:26). <span class="cmt_word">This is also vanity</span>. The old refrain recurs to the writer as he thinks on the prosperity of the wicked, and the conclusions which infidels draw therefrom. Here is another example of the vanity that prevails in all earthly circumstances. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:9-13 Solomon observed, that many a time one man rules over another to his hurt, and that prosperity hardens them in their wickedness. Sinners herein deceive themselves. Vengeance comes slowly, but it comes surely. A good man's days have some substance; he lives to a good purpose: a wicked man's days are all as a shadow, empty and worthless. Let us pray that we may view eternal things as near, real, and all-important.</body></html>
