There is no use in repining or rebelling; <span class="accented">true wisdom counsels obedience to the powers that be</span>, <span class="accented">and submission to the dispensations of Providence</span>. However oppressive a tyrant may prove sure retribution awaits him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is as the wise man?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Who is like, equal to, the wise man? The somewhat sudden question occurs naturally after the results of the search for wisdom mentioned at the end of the last chapter. The thought is not, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>, "Who is wise?" but - No one Call be compared with a wise man; he has no compeer. <span class="cmt_word">And who</span> [like him] <span class="cmt_word">knoweth the interpretation of a thing?</span> Who, so well as the wise man, understands the proper relation of circumstances, sees into human affairs and God's dispensations in the case of nations and individuals? Such a one takes the right view of life. The word <span class="accented">pesher</span>, "interpretation," occurs (<span class="accented">peshar</span>) continually in Daniel, and nowhere else and is Chaldaic. The Vulgate, which connects these two clauses with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7</a>, renders, <span class="accented">Quis cognovit solutionem verbi?</span> So the Septuagint. The "word" or "saying" may be the question proposed above Concerning the happy life, or the proverb that immediately follows. But <span class="accented">dabar</span> is better rendered "thing," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "will enlighten, illuminate." The serene light within makes itself visible in the outward expression; the man is contented arid cheerful, and shows this in his look and bearing. This is an additional praise of wisdom. Thus Ecclus. 13:25, 26, "The heart of man changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or evil. A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity." Cicero, 'De Orat.,' 3:57, "Omnes enim motus animi suum quemdam a natura habet vultum et sonum et gestum; corpusque totum homiuis et ejus omnis vultus omnesque voces, ut nervi in fidibus, ita sonant, ut motu animi quoque sunt pulsae." <span class="cmt_word">And the boldness of his face shall be changed</span>. The word translated "boldness" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d6;</span>, which means properly "strength," and is best taken of the coarseness and impudence engendered by ignorance and want of culture. Wisdom, when it fills the heart, changes the countenance to an open genial look, which wins confidence and love. Delitzsch refers to the well-worn lines of Ovid, 'Epist.,' 2:9. 47 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adde, quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes<br />Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros."</span> The Septuagint, "And a man shameless in countenance will be hated," shows an alteration in the text, and does not agree with the context. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et potentissimus faciem illius commutabit</span>, "And the Almighty will change his face," where again the text is not accurately followed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-5 None of the rich, the powerful, the honourable, or the accomplished of the sons of men, are so excellent, useful, or happy, as the wise man. Who else can interpret the words of God, or teach aright from his truths and dispensations? What madness must it be for weak and dependent creatures to rebel against the Almighty! What numbers form wrong judgments, and bring misery on themselves, in this life and that to come!</body></html>
