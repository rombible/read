This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm" title="I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm" title="Why I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm" title="All his days also he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Eat, and to drink, and to be merry.--</span>The three words occur together <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-20.htm" title="Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.">1Kings 4:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I commended mirth</span>. In face of the anomalies which meet us in our view of life, Koheleth recommends the calm enjoyment of such blessings and comforts as we possess, in exact accordance with what has already been said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>), though the road by which he arrives at the conclusion is <span class="accented">not</span> identical in both cases. In the earlier chapters the injunction is based on man's inability to be the master of his own fate; in the present passage the inscrutable nature of the law that directs God's moral government leads to the advice to make the best of circumstances. In neither instance need we trace veiled Epicureanism. The result obtained is reached by acute observation supplemented by faith in God. <span class="cmt_word">Under the sun.</span> The phrase occurs twice in this verse and again in ver. 17, and implies that the view taken was limited to man's earthly existence. <span class="cmt_word">To eat, and to drink</span>, etc. This is not a commendation of a greedy, voluptuous life, but an injunction thankfully to enjoy the good provided by God without disquieting one's self with the mysteries of Providence. So it was said of Israel in its palmy days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>), "Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry." <span class="cmt_word">For that shall abide with him of his labor</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and that this should accompany him in his labor</span>. The Greek Version regards the verb as indicative, not subjunctive, nor, as others, as jussive: "This shall attend (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) him in his work." But it seems better to consider Koheleth as saying that the happiest thing for a man is to make the best of what he has, and to take with him in all his work a cheerful and contented heart. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-17 Faith alone can establish the heart in this mixed scene, where the righteous often suffer, and the wicked prosper. Solomon commended joy, and holy security of mind, arising from confidence in God, because a man has no better thing under the sun, though a good man has much better things above the sun, than soberly and thankfully to use the things of this life according to his rank. He would not have us try to give a reason for what God does. But, leaving the Lord to clear up all difficulties in his own time, we may cheerfully enjoy the comforts, and bear up under the trials of life; while peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost will abide in us through all outward changes, and when flesh and heart shall fail.</body></html>
