The best commentary on this verse is <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm" title="If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place; for yielding pacifies great offenses.">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, which gives the meaning, "When censured by the king, do not abandon the hope of retaining his favour, nor obstinately persist in what he condemns." I do not find adequate proof of the assertion of some commentators, that "go out of his sight" can mean "withdraw allegiance from him," and so that the "evil thing" means a rebellious conspiracy. The advice, "Be not hasty" to rebel, instead of "do not rebel," is inconsistent with the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Further advice concerning political behavior. <span class="cmt_word">Be not hasty to go out of his</span> (the king's) <span class="cmt_word">sight</span>. Do not, from some hasty impulse, or induced by harsh treatment, cast off your allegiance to your liege lord. We have the phrase, "go away," in the sense of quitting of service or desertion of a duty, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>. So St. Peter urges servants to be subject unto their masters, "not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). Solomon might have given this advice to the Israelites who were ready to follow Jeroboam's lead; though they could have remained loyal to Rehoboam only from high religious motives. But it is better to bear even a heavy yoke than to rebel. The Septuagint has, "Be not hasty; thou shalt go from his presence" - which seems to mean, "Be not impatient, and all will be well." But the authorized rendering is correct (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>). We may quote Mendelssohn's comment cited by Chance on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a>, "This is a great rule in politics, that the people must have no power to pronounce judgment upon the conduct of a king, whether it be good or bad; for the king judges the people, and not the reverse; and if it were not for this rule, the country would never be quiet, and without rebels against the king and his law." <span class="cmt_word">Stand not in an evil thing</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque permaneas in opere malo</span>, "Persist not in an evil affair." But the verb here implies rather the engaging in a matter than continuing an undertaking already begun. The "affair" is conspiracy, insurrection; and Koheleth warns against entering upon and taking part in any such attempt. This seems to be the correct explanation of the clause; but it is, perhaps intentionally, ambiguous, and is capable of other interpretations. Thus Ginsburg, "Do not stand up (in a passion) because of an evil word." Others, "Obey not a sinful command," or "Hesitate not at an evil thing," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. if the king orders it. Wordsworth, referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. renders, "Stand not in the way of sinners," which seems to be unsuitable to the context. The Septuagint gives, "Stand not in an evil word" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>, perhaps "matter"). The reason for the injunction follows. <span class="cmt_word">For he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</span> The irresponsible power of a despotic monarch is here signified, though the terms are applicable (as some, indeed, take them as alone appertaining) to God himself (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>). The Septuagint combines with this clause the commencement of the following verse, "For he will do whatsover he pleases, even as a king using authority (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." Some manuscripts add <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "he speaks." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-5 None of the rich, the powerful, the honourable, or the accomplished of the sons of men, are so excellent, useful, or happy, as the wise man. Who else can interpret the words of God, or teach aright from his truths and dispensations? What madness must it be for weak and dependent creatures to rebel against the Almighty! What numbers form wrong judgments, and bring misery on themselves, in this life and that to come!</body></html>
