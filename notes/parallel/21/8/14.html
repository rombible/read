Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come to them,">Esther 9:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth</span>. The vanity is named in what follows, viz. the seeming injustice it, the distribution of good and evil. <span class="cmt_word">There be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked</span> (comp. ver. 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>). The melancholy fact is noted that the righteous often experience that fate with which the wicked are threatened, which their conduct might be expected to bring upon them. The verb translated "happeneth" (<span class="accented">nags</span>), with <span class="accented">el</span>, "to come to," "strike against," is thus used only in later Hebrew, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-26.htm">Esther 9:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">According to the work of the righteous.</span> The wicked meet with that outward prosperity and success which were thought to be the special reward of those who served God. The Vulgate is explanatory, "There are just men whom evils befall as if they did the works of the wicked; and there are wicked men who are as free from care as if they had the deeds of the just." Commenting on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-10.htm">Job 34:10, 11</a>, St. Gregory writes, "It is by no means always the case in this life that God renders to each man according to his work and according to his own ways. For both many who commit unlawful and wicked deeds he prevents of his free grace, and converts to works of holiness; and some who are devoted to good deeds he reproves by means of the scourge, and so afflicts those who please him, as though they were displeasing to him.... God doubtless so ordains it of his inestimable mercy, that both scourges should torture the just, lest their doings should elate them, and that the unjust should pass this life at least without punishment, because by their evil doings they are hastening onwards to those torments which are without end. For that the just are sometimes scourged in no way according to their deserts is shown by this history of Job. Elihu, therefore, would speak more truly if he had said that there is not unmercifulness and iniquity in God, even when he seems not to render to men according to their ways. For even that which we do not understand is brought forth from the righteous balance of secret judgment" ('Moral.,' 24:44). Koheleth ends by repeating his melancholy refrain, <span class="cmt_word">I said that this also</span> (<span class="accented">indeed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>is vanity</span>. This conclusion, however, does not lead to despair or infidelity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-17 Faith alone can establish the heart in this mixed scene, where the righteous often suffer, and the wicked prosper. Solomon commended joy, and holy security of mind, arising from confidence in God, because a man has no better thing under the sun, though a good man has much better things above the sun, than soberly and thankfully to use the things of this life according to his rank. He would not have us try to give a reason for what God does. But, leaving the Lord to clear up all difficulties in his own time, we may cheerfully enjoy the comforts, and bear up under the trials of life; while peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost will abide in us through all outward changes, and when flesh and heart shall fail.</body></html>
