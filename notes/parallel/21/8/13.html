If experience seemed often to militate against this assertion, Koheleth's faith prevailed against apparent contradictions. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow.</span> Above we read of a wicked man enjoying a long, untroubled life; here the contrary is stated. Such contradictions are seen every day. There are inscrutable reasons for the delay of judgment; but on the whole moral government is vindicated, and even the long life of a sinner is no blessing. The author of the Book of Wisdom writes (4:8), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years;" and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), <span class="accented">"The</span> sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed." Man's life is compared to a shadow because it passes away with the setting sun (see on Ecclesiastes 6:12). The Vulgate, in order to obviate the apparent discrepancy between this and the preceding verses, renders the verb in a precatory form: <span class="accented">Non sit bonum impio</span>, etc., "Let it not be well with the wicked, and let his days not be prolonged; but let them pass away as a shadow who fear not the Lord." This is quite unnecessary; and the words, <span class="accented">"as a shadow,"</span> according to the accents, belong to what precedes, as in the Authorized Version. Hitzig and others have adopted the Vulgate division, and render, "Like a shadow is he who fears not God." But there is no sufficient reason for disregarding the existing accentuation. Septuagint, "He shall not prolong his days in a shadow (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fb7;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Because he feareth not before God</span>. This is the reason, looking to temporal retribution, why the wicked shall not live out half their days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). Koheleth cleaves to the doctrine received from old time, although facts seem often to contradict it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:9-13 Solomon observed, that many a time one man rules over another to his hurt, and that prosperity hardens them in their wickedness. Sinners herein deceive themselves. Vengeance comes slowly, but it comes surely. A good man's days have some substance; he lives to a good purpose: a wicked man's days are all as a shadow, empty and worthless. Let us pray that we may view eternal things as near, real, and all-important.</body></html>
