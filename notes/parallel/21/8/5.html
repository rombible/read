This is an encouragement to obedience to royal authority (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3</a>). The context plainly shows that it is not God's commandment that is spoken of (though, of course, the maxim would be very true in this case), but the king's. Nor is it necessarily a servile and unreasoning obedience that is enjoined. Koheleth is dealing with generals. Such cases as that of Daniel and the three children, where obedience would have been sinful, are not here taken into consideration. "Shall feel," literally, "shall know," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. experience no physical evil. Quiet submission to the powers that be guarantees a peaceful and happy life. Ginsburg and others translate, "knoweth not an evil word," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. is saved from abuse and reproach, which seems somewhat meager, though the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate is better, <span class="accented">Non experietur quidquam malt<span class="cmt_word"></span>. And a wise man's heart discerneth</span> (<span class="accented">knoweth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>both time and judgment.</span> The verb is the same in both clauses, and ought to have been so translated. The "heart" includes the moral as well as the intellectual faculties; and the maxim says that the wise man bears oppression and remains unexcited even in evil days, because he is convinced that there is a time of judgment coming when all will be righted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). The certainty of retributive justice is so strong in his mind that he does not resort to rebellion in order to rectify matters, but possesses his soul in patience, leaving the correction of abuses in God's hands. Septuagint, "The wise man's heart knoweth the time of judgment," making a hendiadys of the two terms. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">tempus et responsionem</span>, "time and answer." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-5 None of the rich, the powerful, the honourable, or the accomplished of the sons of men, are so excellent, useful, or happy, as the wise man. Who else can interpret the words of God, or teach aright from his truths and dispensations? What madness must it be for weak and dependent creatures to rebel against the Almighty! What numbers form wrong judgments, and bring misery on themselves, in this life and that to come!</body></html>
