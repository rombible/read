To eat in darkness is not a common metaphor for spending a gloomy life, but it is a very natural one, and has analogies in this book (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, etc.), and in such phrases as to "sit in darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a>), and to "<span class="accented">walk</span> in darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>). The Septuagint, reading differently, translates, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "Yea, and all his days are in darkness and in mourning." But the other versions reject this alteration, and few modern commentators adopt it. <span class="cmt_word">And he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and much vexation</span>, <span class="accented">and sickness</span>, <span class="accented">and wrath</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">he is sore vexed</span>, <span class="accented">and hath sickness and wrath</span>. Delitzsch takes the last words as an exclamation, "And oh for his sorrow and hatred!" The man experiences all kinds of vexation when his plans fail or involve him in trouble and privation; or he is morbid and diseased in mind and body; or he is angry and envious when others succeed better than himself. The sentiment is expressed by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented">to</span> be rich fall into a temptation and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) in destruction and perdition." "For," he proceeds, "the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) with many sorrows." The Septuagint continues its version, "And in much passion (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>) and in infirmity and wrath." The anger may be directed against himself, as he thinks of his folly in taking all this trouble for nothing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-17 The goodness of Providence is more equally distributed than appears to a careless observer. The king needs the common things of life, and the poor share them; they relish their morsel better than he does his luxuries. There are bodily desires which silver itself will not satisfy, much less will worldly abundance satisfy spiritual desires. The more men have, the better house they must keep, the more servants they must employ, the more guests they must entertain, and the more they will have hanging on them. The sleep of the labourer is sweet, not only because he is tired, but because he has little care to break his sleep. The sleep of the diligent Christian, and his long sleep, are sweet; having spent himself and his time in the service of God, he can cheerfully repose in God as his Rest. But those who have every thing else, often fail to secure a good night's sleep; their abundance breaks their rest. Riches do hurt, and draw away the heart from God and duty. Men do hurt with their riches, not only gratifying their own lusts, but oppressing others, and dealing hardly with them. They will see that they have laboured for the wind, when, at death, they find the profit of their labour is all gone like the wind, they know not whither. How ill the covetous worldling bears the calamities of human life! He does not sorrow to repentance, but is angry at the providence of God, angry at all about him; which doubles his affliction.</body></html>
