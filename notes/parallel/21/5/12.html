The Septuagint, with a different pointing, renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "slave," which is less appropriate, the fact being generally true of free or bond man. Whether his fare be plentiful or scanty, the honest laborer earns and enjoys his night's rest. <span class="cmt_word">But the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</span> The allusion is not to the overloading of the stomach, which might occasion sleeplessness in the case of the poor equally with the rich man, but to the cares and anxieties which wealth brings. "Not a soft couch, nor a bedstead overlaid with silver, nor the quietness that exists throughout the house, nor any other circumstance of this nature, are so generally wont to make sleep sweet and pleasant, as that of laboring, and growing weary, and lying down with a disposition to sleep, and very greatly needing it .... Not so the rich. On the contrary, whilst lying on their beds, they are frequently without sleep through the whole night; and, though they devise many schemes, they do not obtain such pleasure" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hom. on Stat.,' 22). The contrast between the grateful sleep of the tired worker and the disturbed rest of the avaricious and moneyed and luxurious has formed a fruitful theme for poets. Thus Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:1.21 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Somnus agrestium<br />Lenis virorum non humiles domes<br />Fastidit umbrosamque ripam,<br />Non Zephyris agitata Tempe."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Yet sleep turns never from the lowly shed<br />Of humbler-minded men, nor from the eaves<br />In Tempe's graceful vale is banished,<br />Where only Zephyrs stir the murmuring leaves."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Stanley.</span>) And the reverse, 'Sat.,' 1:1.76, <span class="accented">sqq</span>. <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"An vigilare metu exanimem, noctesque diesque<br />Formidare males fures, inccndia, serves,<br />Ne to compilent fugientes, hoc juvat?"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"But what are your indulgencies? All day,<br />All night, to watch and shudder with dismay,<br />Lest ruffians fire your house, or slaves by stealth<br />Rifle your coffers, and abstract your wealth?<br />If this be affluence - this her boasted fruit,<br />Of all such joys may I live destitute."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) Comp. Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 10:12, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 14:304. Shakespeare, 'Henry IV.,' Pt. II., act 3. sc. 1 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,<br />Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,<br />And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,<br />Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,<br />Under the canopies of costly state,<br />And lulled with sounds of sweetest melody?"</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-17 The goodness of Providence is more equally distributed than appears to a careless observer. The king needs the common things of life, and the poor share them; they relish their morsel better than he does his luxuries. There are bodily desires which silver itself will not satisfy, much less will worldly abundance satisfy spiritual desires. The more men have, the better house they must keep, the more servants they must employ, the more guests they must entertain, and the more they will have hanging on them. The sleep of the labourer is sweet, not only because he is tired, but because he has little care to break his sleep. The sleep of the diligent Christian, and his long sleep, are sweet; having spent himself and his time in the service of God, he can cheerfully repose in God as his Rest. But those who have every thing else, often fail to secure a good night's sleep; their abundance breaks their rest. Riches do hurt, and draw away the heart from God and duty. Men do hurt with their riches, not only gratifying their own lusts, but oppressing others, and dealing hardly with them. They will see that they have laboured for the wind, when, at death, they find the profit of their labour is all gone like the wind, they know not whither. How ill the covetous worldling bears the calamities of human life! He does not sorrow to repentance, but is angry at the providence of God, angry at all about him; which doubles his affliction.</body></html>
