Avarice has already been noticed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:7-12</a>); the covetous man now reprobated is one who desires wealth only for the enjoyment he can get from it, or the display which it enables him to make, not, like the miser, who gloats over its mere possession. Various instances are given in which riches are unprofitable and vain. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver</span>. "Silver," the generic name for money, as Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and French <span class="accented">argent</span>. The insatiableness of the passion for money is a common theme of poets, moralists, and satirists, and is found in the proverbs of all nations. Thus Horace ('Ep.,' 1:2. 56): "Semper avarus eget;" to which St Jerome alludes ('Epist.,' 53), "Antiquum dictum est, Avaro tam deest, quod habet, quam quod non habet." Comp. Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:139 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum forget sacculus ere,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecnnia crevit."</span><br /><span class="accented">"For as thy strutting bags with money rise,<br />The love of gain is of an equal size."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Dryden.</span>) There is much more of similar import in Horace. See 'Carm.,' 2:2. 13, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 3:16. 17, 28; 'Ep.,' 2:2, 147; an, 1 Ovid, Fast.,' 1:211 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Creverunt etopes et opum furiosa cupido,<br />Et, quum possideant plura, plura volunt."</span><br /><span class="accented">"As wealth increases grows the frenzied thirst<br />For wealth; the more they have, the more they want."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Nor he that loveth abundance with increase</span>. The Authorized Version scarcely presents the sense of the passage, which is not tautological, but rather that given by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et qui amat divitias fructum non capiet exeis</span>, "He who loveth abundance of wealth hath no fruit therefrom;" he derives no real profit or enjoyment from the luxury which it enables him to procure; rather it brings added trouble. And so the old conclusion is again reached, this is also vanity. Hitzig takes the sentence as interrogative, "Who hath pleasure in abundance which brings nothing in?" But such questions are hardly in the style of Kohelcth, and the notion of capital without interest is not a thought which would have been then understood. The Septuagint, however, reads the clause interrogatively, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">al</span>.) <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; "And who has loved [or, has been content with] gain in its fullness?" But <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is not necessarily interrogative, but here indefinite, equivalent to "whosoever." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-17 The goodness of Providence is more equally distributed than appears to a careless observer. The king needs the common things of life, and the poor share them; they relish their morsel better than he does his luxuries. There are bodily desires which silver itself will not satisfy, much less will worldly abundance satisfy spiritual desires. The more men have, the better house they must keep, the more servants they must employ, the more guests they must entertain, and the more they will have hanging on them. The sleep of the labourer is sweet, not only because he is tired, but because he has little care to break his sleep. The sleep of the diligent Christian, and his long sleep, are sweet; having spent himself and his time in the service of God, he can cheerfully repose in God as his Rest. But those who have every thing else, often fail to secure a good night's sleep; their abundance breaks their rest. Riches do hurt, and draw away the heart from God and duty. Men do hurt with their riches, not only gratifying their own lusts, but oppressing others, and dealing hardly with them. They will see that they have laboured for the wind, when, at death, they find the profit of their labour is all gone like the wind, they know not whither. How ill the covetous worldling bears the calamities of human life! He does not sorrow to repentance, but is angry at the providence of God, angry at all about him; which doubles his affliction.</body></html>
