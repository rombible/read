There are some who take it of simple surprise. "You need not think it strange; the instances of oppression which you observe are only parts of a gigantic scheme of mutual wrong-doing, the oppressors of one being themselves oppressed in turn by their superiors." But instead of "Do not wonder," the meaning "be not dismayed" is preferable. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-5.htm" title="They saw it, and so they marveled; they were troubled, and hurried away.">Psalm 48:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm" title="And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at that day, said the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.">Jeremiah 4:9</a>.) The verse then supplies the answer to the gloomy view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm" title="Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>. In the view that the last clause speaks of the Divine rectification of earthly injustice, I am confirmed by observing that the author of this book delights in verbal assonances, and constantly links together words similar in sound. An English version might admit the meaning: "Over the high oppressor stands a higher, and over both, those who are higher still; "though even here there is the difficulty that the highest of all are spoken of in the plural number, of which it is a very awkward explanation that the "higher" is the king, and that the women and favourites who govern him are the "higher still." But I cannot but think that the language of the Hebrew, that over the <span class= "ital">"geb?h" </span>there be "<span class= "ital">geb?him," </span>is intended to suggest <span class= "ital">Elohim </span>to the reader's mind.<p>On the word "province," see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm" title="I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>; and on "matter," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm" title="To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-17.</span> - Section 7. <span class="accented">Perils to which one is exposed in a despotic state</span>, <span class="accented">and the unprofitableness of riches</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - In political life there is little that is satisfactory; yet one must not surrender one's belief in a superintending Providence. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou seest the oppression of the poor</span>. From errors in the service of God, it is natural to turn to faults in the administration of the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a>). Koheleth has already alluded to these anomalies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a> and Ecclesiastes 4:1. <span class="cmt_word">Violent perverting</span>; literally, <span class="accented">robbery</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>so that judgment</span> is never rightly given, <span class="cmt_word">and justice</span> is withheld from applicants. In a province (<span class="accented">me dinah</span>, <span class="accented">Ecclesiastes</span> 2:8); the district in which the person addressed dwells. It may, perhaps, to implied that {his is remote from the central authority, and therefore more liable to be injuriously dealt with by unscrupulous rulers. <span class="cmt_word">Marvel not at the matter</span> (<span class="accented">chephets</span>, <span class="accented">Ecclesiastes</span> 3:1). Be not surprised or dismayed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a>) at such evil doings,, as though they were unheard of, or inexperienced, or disregarded. There is here nothing of the Greek maxim, reproduced by Horace in his "Nil admirari" ('Epist.,' 1:6. 1). It is like St. John's "Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>); or St. Peter's "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among' you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>). The stupid and unintelligent observation of such disorders might lead to arraignment of Providence and distrust in the moral government of God. Against such mistakes the writer guards. <span class="cmt_word">For he that is higher than the highest regardeth.</span> Both the words are in the singular number. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. One thinks of the Persian satraps, who acted much as the Turkish pashas in later times, the petty rulers oppressing the people, and being themselves treated in the same fashion by their superiors. The whole is a system of wrong-doing, where the weaker always suffers, and the only comfort is that the oppressor himself is subject to higher supervision. The verb (<span class="accented">shamar</span>) translated "regardeth" means to observe in a hostile sense, to watch for occasions of reprisal, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>; and the idea intended is that in the province there were endless plottings and counterplottings, mutual denunciations and recriminations; that such things were only to be expected, and were no sufficient cause for infidelity or despair. "The higher one" is the monarch, the despotic king who holds the supreme power over all these malad-ministrators and perverters of justice. <span class="cmt_word">And there be higher than they</span>. "Higher" is here plural (<span class="accented">gebohgm</span>), the plural of majesty, as it is called (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>), like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, the word for "God," the assonance being probably here suggestive. Over the highest of earthly rulers there are other powers, angels, principalities, up to God himself, who governs the course of this world, and to whom we may leave the final adjustment. Who are meant seems purposely to be left undetermined; but the thought of the righteous Judge of all is intimated in accordance with the view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>. This is a far more satisfactory explanation of the passage than that which regards as the highest of all "the court favorites, king's friends, eunuchs, chamberlains," etc. In this view Koheleth is merely asserting the general system of injustice and oppression, and neither accounting for it nor offering any comfort under the circumstances. But his object throughout is to show man's inability to secure his own happiness, and the need of submission to Divine providence. To demonstrate the anomalies in the events of the world, the circumstances of men's lives would be only one part of his task, which would not be completed without turning attention to the remedy against hasty and unfair conclusions. This remedy is the thought of the supreme Disposer of events, who holds all the strings in his hand, and will in the end bring good out of evil. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:4-8 When a person made engagements rashly, he suffered his mouth to cause his flesh to sin. The case supposes a man coming to the priest, and pretending that his vow was made rashly, and that it would be wrong to fulfil it. Such mockery of God would bring the Divine displeasure, which might blast what was thus unduly kept. We are to keep down the fear of man. Set God before thee; then, if thou seest the oppression of the poor, thou wilt not find fault with Divine Providence; nor think the worse of the institution of magistracy, when thou seest the ends of it thus perverted; nor of religion, when thou seest it will not secure men from suffering wrong. But though oppressors may be secure, God will reckon for all.</body></html>
