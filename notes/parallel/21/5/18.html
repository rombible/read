The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">Behold</span>, I have seen a good which is comely;" and it is best to translate, with Delitzsch and others, "Behold, what I have seen as good, what as beautiful, is this." My conclusion holds good. They who seek for traces of Greek influence in Koheleth find Epicureanism in the sentiment, and the familiar combination, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, in the language. Both ideas are baseless. (For supposed Epicureanism, see on Ecclesiastes 2:24 and Ecclesiastes 3:12.) And the juxtaposition of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is only a fortuitous rendering of the Hebrew, upon which no argument for Grecism can be founded. <span class="cmt_word">To eat and to drink</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to use the common blessings which God bestows with thankfulness and contentment. As St. Paul says, "Having food and covering, we shall he therewith content" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-8.htm">1 Timothy 6:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which God giveth him</span>. This is the point so often insisted upon. These temporal blessings are God's gifts, and are not to be considered as the natural and assured result of man's own exertions. Man, indeed, must labor, but God giveth the increase. <span class="cmt_word">For it is his portion</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>). This calm enjoyment is allotted to man by God, and nothing more must be expected. Ben-Sira gives similar advice, "Defraud not thyself of a good day, and let not the share in a right pleasure pass by thee Give, and take, and beguile thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in Hades" (Ecclus. 14:14. etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-20 Life is God's gift. We must not view our calling as a drudgery, but take pleasure in the calling where God puts us. A cheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes employments easy, and afflictions light. Having made a proper use of riches, a man will remember the days of his past life with pleasure. The manner in which Solomon refers to God as the Giver, both of life and its enjoyments, shows they ought to be received and to be used, consistently with his will, and to his glory. Let this passage recommend to all the kind words of the merciful Redeemer, Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life. Christ is the Bread of life, the only food of the soul. All are invited to partake of this heavenly provision.</body></html>
