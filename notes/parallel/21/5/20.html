This is the usual explanation; and though not satisfied with it, we cannot suggest a better.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he shall not much remember the days of his life</span>. The man who has learned the lesson of calm enjoyment does not much concern himself with the shortness, uncertainty, or possible trouble of life. He carries out the counsel of Christ, "<span class="accented">Be</span> not anxious for the morrow, for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>). Ginsburg gives an entirely opposite rendering to the clause, "<span class="accented">He</span> should remember that the days of his life are not many;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the thought of the shortness of life should urge us to enjoy it while it lasts. But the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint and Vulgate and most modern commentators, and seems most appropriate to the context. The marginal rendering, "<span class="accented">Though</span> he give <span class="accented">not much</span>, yet <span class="accented">he remembereth</span>," etc., which Ginsburg calls a literary curiosity, must have been derived from the version of Junius, which gives, "Quod si non multum (<span class="accented">supple</span>, est illud quod dederit Deus, <span class="accented">ex versu praec</span>.)," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Because God answereth him in the joy of his heart</span>. The man passes a calm and contented life, because God shows that he is pleased with him by the tranquil joy shed over his heart. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (the hiph. participle of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is variously rendered. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "God distracts him in the mirth of his heart;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Eo quod Deus occupet deliciis cot ejus</span>; Ginsburg, "God causeth him to work for the enjoyment of his heart," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. God assigns him work that he may thence derive enjoyment; Koster," God makes him sing in the joy of his heart;" Delitzsch, Wright, and Plumptre, "God answers (corresponds with) the joy of his heart," which the latter explains to mean "is felt to approve it as harmonizing, in its calm evenness, with his own blessedness, the tranquility of the wise man mirroring the tranquility of God." But this modified Epicureanism is alien from the teaching of Koheleth. Rather the idea is that God answers him with, imparts to him, joy of heart, makes him sensible of his favorable regard by this inward feeling of satisfaction and content. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-20 Life is God's gift. We must not view our calling as a drudgery, but take pleasure in the calling where God puts us. A cheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes employments easy, and afflictions light. Having made a proper use of riches, a man will remember the days of his past life with pleasure. The manner in which Solomon refers to God as the Giver, both of life and its enjoyments, shows they ought to be received and to be used, consistently with his will, and to his glory. Let this passage recommend to all the kind words of the merciful Redeemer, Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life. Christ is the Bread of life, the only food of the soul. All are invited to partake of this heavenly provision.</body></html>
