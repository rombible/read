There is here plainly a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>. Vows are not regarded as absolute duties which every one was obliged to undertake. They are of a voluntary nature, but when made are to be strictly performed. They might consist of a promise to dedicate certain things or persons to God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-20.htm">Genesis 38:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>), or to abstain from doing certain things, as in the case of the Nazarites. The rabbinical injunction quoted by our Lord in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33</a>), "Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths," was probably levelled against profane swearing, or invoking God's Name lightly, but it may include the duty of performing vows made to or in the Name of God. Our Lord does not condemn the practice of <span class="accented">corban</span>, while noticing with rebuke a perversion of the custom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>). For he hath no pleasure in fools. The non-fulfillment of a vow would prove a man to be impious, in proverbial language "a fool," and as such God must regard him with displeasure. The clause in the Hebrew is somewhat ambiguous, being literally, <span class="accented">There is no pleasure</span> (<span class="accented">chephets</span>) <span class="accented">in fools</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. no one, neither God nor man, would take pleasure in fools who make promises and never perform them. Or it may be, There <span class="accented">is no fixed will in fools</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they waver and are undecided in purpose. But this rendering of <span class="accented">chephets</span> appears to be very doubtful. Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> which reproduces the vagueness of the Hebrew; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Displicet enim ei</span> (<span class="accented">Deo</span>) <span class="accented">infidelis et stulta promissio</span>. The meaning is well represented in the Authorized Version, and we must complete the sense by supplying in thought "on the part of God." <span class="cmt_word">Pay that which thou but vowed</span>. Ben-Sirs re-echoes the injunction (Ecclus. 18:22, 23), "Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) in due time, and defer not until death to be justified [i.e. to fulfill the vow]. Before making a vow (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) prepare thyself; and be not as one that tempteth the Lord." The verse is cited in the Talmud; and Dukes gives a parallel, "Before thou vowest anything, consider the object of thy vow" ('Rabb. Blumenl.,' p. 70). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a> we have, according to some translations, "It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, and after vows to make inquiry." Septuagint," Pay thou therefore whatsoever thou shalt have vowed (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b7;</span>), <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:4-8 When a person made engagements rashly, he suffered his mouth to cause his flesh to sin. The case supposes a man coming to the priest, and pretending that his vow was made rashly, and that it would be wrong to fulfil it. Such mockery of God would bring the Divine displeasure, which might blast what was thus unduly kept. We are to keep down the fear of man. Set God before thee; then, if thou seest the oppression of the poor, thou wilt not find fault with Divine Providence; nor think the worse of the institution of magistracy, when thou seest the ends of it thus perverted; nor of religion, when thou seest it will not secure men from suffering wrong. But though oppressors may be secure, God will reckon for all.</body></html>
