While the former word, <span class="accented">osher</span>; is used for wealth of any kind whatever, the latter, <span class="accented">nekasim</span>, means properly "wealth in cattle," like the Latin <span class="accented">pecunia</span>, and thence used generally for riches (<span class="accented">volek</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hath given him power to eat thereof.</span> Abundance is useless without the power to enjoy it. <span class="cmt_word">This is the gift of God</span>, a great and special bounty from a loving and gracious God. Thus Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:4. 7 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The gods have given you wealth, and (what is more)<br />Have given you wisdom to enjoy your store."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-20 Life is God's gift. We must not view our calling as a drudgery, but take pleasure in the calling where God puts us. A cheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes employments easy, and afflictions light. Having made a proper use of riches, a man will remember the days of his past life with pleasure. The manner in which Solomon refers to God as the Giver, both of life and its enjoyments, shows they ought to be received and to be used, consistently with his will, and to his glory. Let this passage recommend to all the kind words of the merciful Redeemer, Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life. Christ is the Bread of life, the only food of the soul. All are invited to partake of this heavenly provision.</body></html>
