Thus our Lord bids those who pray not to use vain repetitions (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), as the heathen, who think to be heard for their much speaking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm">Matthew 6:7</a>). Jesus himself used the same words in his prayer in the garden, and he continually urges the lesson of much and constant prayer - a lessen enforced by apostolic admonitions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>); but it is quite possible to use the same words, and yet throw the whole heart into them each time that they are repeated. Whether the repetition is vain or not depends upon the spirit of the person who prays. <span class="cmt_word">Let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God.</span> We should weigh well our wishes, arrange them discreetly, ponder whether they are such as we can rightly make subjects of petition, ere we lay them in words before the Lord. "Before God" may mean in the temple, the house of God, where he is specially present, as Solomon himself testified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27, 30, 43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">God is in heaven</span>. The infinite distance between God and man, illustrated by the contrast of earth and the illimitable heaven, is the ground of the admonition to reverence and thoughtfulness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4.htm">Isaiah 4</a>:8, 9; 66:1). Therefore let thy words be few, as becomes one who speaks in the awful presence of God. Ben-Sirs seems to have had this passage in mind when he writes (Ecclus. 7:14), "Prate not in a multitude of elders, and repeat not (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) the word in prayer." We may remember the conduct of the priests of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>). Ginsburg and Wright quote the Talmudic precept ('Beraehoth,' 68. a), "Let the words of a man always be few in the presence of God, according as it is written," and then follows the passage in our text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-3 Address thyself to the worship of God, and take time to compose thyself for it. Keep thy thoughts from roving and wandering: keep thy affections from running out toward wrong objects. We should avoid vain repetitions; copious prayers are not here condemned, but those that are unmeaning. How often our wandering thoughts render attendance on Divine ordinances little better than the sacrifice of fools! Many words and hasty ones, used in prayer, show folly in the heart, low thoughts of God, and careless thoughts of our own souls.</body></html>
