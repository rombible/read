This would force us to understand the subject of the clause to be, not the fools, but those who are ready to hear. The Authorised Version exhibits one of the expedients resorted to in order to get a better meaning. Another is, "They are without knowledge, so that they do evil."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - Section 6. Man's outward and secular life being unable to secure happiness and satisfaction, can these be found in <span class="accented">popular religion?</span> Religious exercises need the observation of strict rules, which are far from meeting with general attention. Koheleth proceeds to give instruction, in the form of maxims, concerning public worship, prayer, and vows. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse, in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin Bibles, forms the conclusion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4</a>, and is taken independently; but the division in our version is more natural, and the connection of this with the following verses is obvious. <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God</span>, Some read "feet" instead of "foot," but the singular and plural numbers are both found in this signification (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59, 105</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26, 27</a>). To "keep the foot" is to be careful of the conduct, to remember what you are about, whither you are going. There is no allusion to the sacerdotal rite of washing the feet before entering the holy place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18, 19</a>), nor to the custom of removing the shoes on entering a consecrated building, which was a symbol of reverential awe and obedient service. The expression is simply a term connected with man's ordinary life transferred to his moral and religious life. <span class="accented">The house of God</span> is the temple. The tabernacle is called "the house of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-20.htm">2 Samuel 12:20</a>), and this name is commonly applied to the temple; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-16.htm">2 Chronicles 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>. But "house of God" is applied also to the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-14.htm">2 Chronicles 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8, 15</a>, etc.), so that we need not, with Bullock, suppose that Koheleth avoids the name of the Lord of the covenant as "a natural sign of the writer's humiliation after his fall into idolatry, and an acknowledgment of his unworthiness of the privileges of a son of the covenant." It is probable that the expression here is meant to include synagogues as well as the great temple at Jerusalem, since the following clause seems to imply that exhortation would be heard there, which formed no part of the temple service. The verse has furnished a text on the subject of the reverence due to God's house and service from Chrysostom downwards. <span class="cmt_word">And be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools.</span> Various are the renderings of this clause. Wright, "For to draw near to hear is (better) than the fools offering sacrifices." (So virtually Knobel, Ewald, etc.) Ginsburg, "For it is nearer to obey than to offer the sacrifice of the disobedient;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. it is the straighter, truer way to take when you obey God than when you merely perform outward service. The Vulgate takes the infinitive verb as equivalent to the imperative, as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Appropinqua ut audias</span>; but it is best to regard it as pure infinitive, and to translate, "To approach in order to hear is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools." The sentiment is the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, 'Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." The same thought occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7-15</a>; and continually in the prophets; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, etc. It is the reaction against the mere ceremonialism which marked the popular religion. Koheleth had seen and deplored this at Jerusalem and elsewhere, and he enunciates the great troth that it is more acceptable to God that one should go to his house to hear the Law read and taught and expounded, than to offer a formal sacrifice, which, as being the offering of a godless man is called in proverbial language "the sacrifice of fools" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>). The verb used here, "give" (nathan), is not the usual expression for offering sacrifice, and may possibly refer to the feast which accompanied such sacrifices, and which often degenerated into excess (Delitzsch). That the verb rendered "to hear" does not mean merely "to obey" is plain from its reference to conduct in the house of God. The reading of the Law, and probably of the prophets, formed a feature of the temple service in Koheleth's day; the expounding of the same in public was confined to the synagogues, which seem to have originated in the time of the exile, though there were doubtless before that time some regular occasions of assembling together (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For they consider not that they do evil</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Qui nesciunt quid faciunt mali</span> (Vulgate); "They are without knowledge, so that they do evil" (Delitzsch, Knobel, etc.); "As they (who obey) know not to do evil" (Gins-burg). The words can scarcely mean, "They know not that they do evil;" nor, as Hitzig has, "<span class="accented">They</span> know not how to be sorrowful." There is much difficulty in understanding the passage according to the received reading, and Nowack, with others, deems the text corrupt. If we accept what we now find, it is best to translate, "They know not, so that they do evil;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. their ignorance predisposes them to err in this matter. The persons meant are the "fools" who offer unacceptable sacrifices. These know not how to worship God heartily and properly, and, thinking to please him with their formal acts of devotion, fall into a grievous sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-3 Address thyself to the worship of God, and take time to compose thyself for it. Keep thy thoughts from roving and wandering: keep thy affections from running out toward wrong objects. We should avoid vain repetitions; copious prayers are not here condemned, but those that are unmeaning. How often our wandering thoughts render attendance on Divine ordinances little better than the sacrifice of fools! Many words and hasty ones, used in prayer, show folly in the heart, low thoughts of God, and careless thoughts of our own souls.</body></html>
