Thus we have "stones of pleasure" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-12.htm">Isaiah 54:12</a>). He added the grace of refined diction to the solid sense of his utterances. Plumptre reminds us of the "gracious words" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>) which proceeded from the mouth of him who, being the Incarnate Wisdom of God, was indeed greater than Solomon. On the necessity of a work being attractive as well as conforming to literary rules, Horace long ago wrote ('Ars Poet.,' 99) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Non satis est pulchra esse poemata; dulcia sunto,<br />Et quoeunque volent animum auditoris agunto."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"'Tis not enough that poems faultless be,<br />And fair; let them be tender too, and draw<br />The hearer by the cord of sympathy."</span> St. Augustine is copious on this subject in his treatise, 'De Doctr. Christ.;' thus (4:26): "Proinde ilia tria, ut intelligant qui audiunt, ut delectentur, ut obediant, etiam in hoc genere agendum est, ubi tenet delectatio principatum .... Sed quis movetur, si nescit quod dicitur? Ant quis tenetur ut audiat, si non delectatur?" <span class="cmt_word">And that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</span> The Authorized Version, with its interpolations, does not accurately convey the sense of the original. The sentence is to be regarded as containing phrases in apposition to the "acceptable words" of the first clause; thus: "Koheleth sought to discover words of pleasure, and a writing in sincerity, words of truth. 'The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a writing of uprightness;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">et conscripsit sermones rectissimos</span>. The meaning is that what he wrote had two characteristics - it was sincere, that which he really thought and believed, and it was true objectively. If any reader was disposed to cavil, and to depreciate the worth of the treatise because it was not the genuine work of the celebrated Solomon, the writer claims attention to his production on the ground of its intrinsic qualities, as inspired by the same wisdom which animated his great predecessor. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:8-14 Solomon repeats his text, VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY. These are the words of one that could speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world, which can do nothing to ease men of the burden of sin. As he considered the worth of souls, he gave good heed to what he spake and wrote; words of truth will always be acceptable words. The truths of God are as goads to such as are dull and draw back, and nails to such as are wandering and draw aside; means to establish the heart, that we may never sit loose to our duty, nor be taken from it. The Shepherd of Israel is the Giver of inspired wisdom. Teachers and guides all receive their communications from him. The title is applied in Scripture to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The prophets sought diligently, what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. To write many books was not suited to the shortness of human life, and would be weariness to the writer, and to the reader; and then was much more so to both than it is now. All things would be vanity and vexation, except they led to this conclusion, That to fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole of man. The fear of God includes in it all the affections of the soul towards him, which are produced by the Holy Spirit. There may be terror where there is no love, nay, where there is hatred. But this is different from the gracious fear of God, as the feelings of an affectionate child. The fear of God, is often put for the whole of true religion in the heart, and includes its practical results in the life. Let us attend to the one thing needful, and now come to him as a merciful Saviour, who will soon come as an almighty Judge, when he will bring to light the things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of all hearts. Why does God record in his word, that ALL IS VANITY, but to keep us from deceiving ourselves to our ruin? He makes our duty to be our interest. May it be graven in all our hearts. Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all that concerns man.</body></html>
