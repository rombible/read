Though the general purpose of the verses is plain, the words used are enigmatical, and one cannot feel great confidence in assigning their precise meaning. The translation of our version fairly represents the original, if it is observed that the words "by" and "which," which determine the meaning, are in italics. With regard to the "nail," compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm" title="And now for a little space grace has been showed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.">Ezra 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm" title="And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.">Isaiah 22:23</a>. The word "masters" we have had twice in this book already in the sense of possessor, "master of the tongue" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm" title="Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>), "master of wings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>). "Assemblies" is a word not coming from the same root as that from which Koheleth is derived. It might mean collections of sayings as well as of people. It is difficult to affix any meaning to the last clause, except that the sages, of whom the verse speaks, have been given for the instruction of the people by Israel's great Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of the wise are as goads</span>. The connection of this verse with the preceding is maintained by the fact that the "acceptable words," etc., are words of the wise, emanate from the same persons. Herewith he proceeds to characterize them, with especial reference to his own work. The goad was a rod with an iron spike, or sharpened at the end, used in driving oxen (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a>; Ecclus. 38:25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>). Words of wisdom are called goads because they rouse to exertion, promote reflection and action, restrain from error, impel to right; if they hurt and sting, the pain which they inflict is healthful, for good and not for evil. <span class="cmt_word">And as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies</span>. The proposition "by" is an interpolation, and the sentence should run: Ant/ <span class="accented">like nails fastened</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">the, etc</span>. <span class="accented">- masmeroth</span>, "nails," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>. There is much difficulty in explaining the next words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">baale asuppoth</span>). We have had similar expressions applied to possessors in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>, "lord of the tongue," and "lord of wings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>); and analogy might lead us to apply the phrase here to-persons, and not things; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> we find a threshing-instrument termed "lord of teeth;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a> a town is called Baal-Perazim, "Lord of breaches;" so we must be guided by other considerations in our exposition. The Septuagint, taking the whole sentence together, and regarding <span class="accented">baals</span> as a preposition, renders, "As nails firmly planted, (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) which from the collections were given from one shepherd."

The "masters of assemblies" can only be the chiefs of some learned conclaves, like the great synagogue supposed to exist in the time of Ezra and later. The clause would then assert that these pundits are like fastened nails, which seems rather unmeaning. One might say that their uttered sentiments became fixed in the mind as nails firmly driven in, but one could not properly say this of the men themselves. A late editor, Gietmann, suggests that "lords of collection" may mean "brave men, heroes, gathered in line of battle," serried ranks, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20</a> the <span class="accented">term shalishim</span>, chariot-fighters, chieftains, is applied to choice proverbs. Thus he would say that the words of the wise are as goads because they stimulate the intellect, as nails because they readily find entrance, and like men in battle array when they are reduced to writing and marshaled in a book. This is certainly ingenious, but somewhat too artificial to be regarded as the genuine intention of the writer. It seems best to take the word translated "assemblies" as denoting collections, not of people, but of proverbs; and the compound phrase would thus mean proverbs of an excellent character, the best of their sort gathered together in writing. Such words are well compared to nails; they are no longer floating loosely about, they are fixed in the memory, they secure other knowledge, and, though they are separate utterances, they have a certain unity and purpose. Nails are often used proverbially as emblems of what is fixed and unalterable. Thus AEschyl., 'Suppl.,' 944 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x1fef;&#x39d;&#x39b;&#x1ffd;&#x393;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Through them a nail is firmly fixed, that they<br />May rest immovable."</span> Cicero, 'Verr.,' 2:5.21, "Ut hoc beneficium, quemadmodum dicitur, trabali clave figeret;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to make it sure and steadfast (comp. Horace, 'Carm.,' 1:35. 17, et <span class="accented">seq</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Which are given from one shepherd</span>. All these words of the wise, collections, etc., proceed from one source, or are set forth by one authority. Who is] this shepherd? Some say that he is the <span class="accented">archisynagogus</span>, the president of the assemblies of wise men, to whose authority all these public utterances are subjected. But we do not <span class="accented">know</span> that such supervision existed or was exercised at the time when Koheleth wrote; and, as we saw above, there is probably no reference to any such assemblies in the passage. The "one shepherd" is doubtless Jehovah, who is called the Shepherd of Israel, who feeds his people like a flock, etc. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>, etc.). The appellation is here used as concinnous with the thought of the ox-goad, intimating that God watches and leads his people like a tender shepherd and a skilful farmer. This is an important claim to inspiration. All these varied utterances, whatever form they take, whether his own or his predecessor's, are outcomes of wisdom, and proceed from him who is only wise, Almighty God. It is no disparagement of this work to imply that it is not the production of the true Solomon; Koheleth is ready to avow himself the writer, and yet claims a hearing as being equally moved by heavenly influence. It is like St. Paul's assertion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>), "I think that I also have the Spirit of God." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:8-14 Solomon repeats his text, VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY. These are the words of one that could speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world, which can do nothing to ease men of the burden of sin. As he considered the worth of souls, he gave good heed to what he spake and wrote; words of truth will always be acceptable words. The truths of God are as goads to such as are dull and draw back, and nails to such as are wandering and draw aside; means to establish the heart, that we may never sit loose to our duty, nor be taken from it. The Shepherd of Israel is the Giver of inspired wisdom. Teachers and guides all receive their communications from him. The title is applied in Scripture to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The prophets sought diligently, what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. To write many books was not suited to the shortness of human life, and would be weariness to the writer, and to the reader; and then was much more so to both than it is now. All things would be vanity and vexation, except they led to this conclusion, That to fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole of man. The fear of God includes in it all the affections of the soul towards him, which are produced by the Holy Spirit. There may be terror where there is no love, nay, where there is hatred. But this is different from the gracious fear of God, as the feelings of an affectionate child. The fear of God, is often put for the whole of true religion in the heart, and includes its practical results in the life. Let us attend to the one thing needful, and now come to him as a merciful Saviour, who will soon come as an almighty Judge, when he will bring to light the things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of all hearts. Why does God record in his word, that ALL IS VANITY, but to keep us from deceiving ourselves to our ruin? He makes our duty to be our interest. May it be graven in all our hearts. Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all that concerns man.</body></html>
