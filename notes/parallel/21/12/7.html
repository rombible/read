(See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the dust return</span>, etc. - the sentence begun above being still carried on to the end of the verse. Here we are told what becomes of the complex man at death, and are thus led to the explanation of the allegorical language used throughout. Without metaphor now it is stated that the material body, when life is extinct, returns to that matter out of which it was originally made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-15.htm">Job 34:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). So Siracides calls man "dust and ashes," and asserts that all things that are of the earth turn to the earth again (Ecclus. 10:9 Ecclus. 40:11). Soph., 'Electra,' 1158 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x1fef;&#x39d;&#x39b;&#x1ffd;&#x39c;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Instead of thy dear form,<br />Mere dust and idle shadow."</span> Corn. a Lapide quotes a remarkable parallel given by Plutarch ('Apol. ad Apollon.,' 110) from Epicharmus," Life is compounded and broken up, and again goes whence it came; earth indeed to earth, and the spirit to upper regions." <span class="cmt_word">And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it</span>; or, for the <span class="accented">spirit - the</span> clause being no longer subjunctive, but speaking indicatively of fact. In the first clause the preposition "to" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, in the second <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, as if to mark the distinction between the downward and the upward way. The writer now rises superior to the doubts expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a> (where see note), "Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward," etc.? It is not that he contradicts himself in the two passages, as some suppose, and have hence regarded ver. 7 as an interpolation; but that after all discussion, after expressing the course of his perplexities, and the various phases of his thought, he comes to the conclusion that there is a future for the individual soul, and that it shall be brought into immediate connection with a personal God. There is here no thought of its being absorbed in the <span class="accented">anima mundi</span>, in accordance with the heathen view, which, if it believed dimly in an immortality, denied the personality of the soul (see Eurip., ' Suppl.,' 529-534; Lucret., 2. 998, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 3:455, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.). Nor have we any opinion given concerning the adverse doctrines of creationism and traducianism, though the terms used are most consistent with the former. God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life; when this departs, he who gave receives it; God "gathereth in" man's breath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). The clause, taken in this restricted sense, would say nothing about the soul, the personal "I;" it would merely indicate the destination of the vital breath; and many critics are content to see nothing more in the words. But surely this would be a feeble conclusion of the author's wanderings; rather the sentence signifies that death, releasing the spirit, or soul, from the earthly tabernacle, places it in the more immediate presence of God, there, as the Targum paraphrases the passage, returning to stand in judgment before its Creator. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-7 We should remember our sins against our Creator, repent, and seek forgiveness. We should remember our duties, and set about them, looking to him for grace and strength. This should be done early, while the body is strong, and the spirits active. When a man has the pain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin and worldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them, renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurative description of old age and its infirmities, which has some difficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are a figurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany old age, ver. 6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hour of death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmities would not have been known. Surely then the aged should reflect on the evil of sin.</body></html>
