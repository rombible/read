If so, it seems to me clear that the writer, who has up to this recorded the words of Koheleth, now speaks in his own name, and informs his readers that the preacher, whose teaching of the people he preserves, was also a writer, and the author of the well-known Proverbs.<p><span class= "bld">Moreover.</span>--This, the first word of the epilogue, is one of the specialties of the book of Ecclesiastes. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm" title="Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>.) So is also the word for "set in order" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm" title="That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm" title="Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - THE EPILOGUE. This contains some observations commendatory of the author, explaining his standpoint and the object of the book, the great conclusion to which it leads. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - Koheleth as teacher of wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And moreover</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); rather, with the following <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;</span> <span class="accented">besides that</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The Preacher was wise.</span> If we render "because the Preacher was wise," we are making an unnecessary statement, as the whole book has demonstrated this fact, which goes without saying. What the writer here asserts is that Koheleth did not merely possess wisdom, but had made good use of it for the instruction of others. The author throws aside his disguise, and speaks of his object in composing the book, with a glance at the historical Solomon whom he had personated. That he uses the third person in relation to himself is nothing uncommon in historical memoirs, etc. Thus Daniel writes; and St. John, Thucydides, Xenophon, Caesar, mask their personality by dropping their identity with the author (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>). The attestation that follows is compared with that at the end of St. John's Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>), and is plainly intended to confirm the authority of the writer, and to enforce on the hearer the conviction that, though Solomon himself did not compose the work, it has every claim to receive attention, and possesses intrinsic value. <span class="cmt_word">He still taught the people knowledge.</span> As well as being esteemed one of the company of sages, he further (<span class="accented">od</span>) took pains to instruct his contemporaries (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint), to apply his wisdom to educational purposes. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he gave good heed</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">weighed</span> (like our word "ponder"); only thus used in this passage. It denotes the careful examination of every fact and argument before it was presented to the public. <span class="cmt_word">Sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span> There is no copula in the original; the weighing and the investigation issued in the composition of "proverbs," which term includes not only the wit and wisdom of past ages in the form of pithy sayings and apophthegms, but also parables, truths in metaphorical guise, riddles, instructions, allegories, etc., all those forms which are found in the canonical Book of Proverbs. The same word (<span class="accented">mishle</span>) <span class="accented">is used</span> here as in the title of <span class="accented">that</span> book. Koheleth, however, is not necessarily referring to that work (or to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>, etc.), or implying that he himself wrote it; he is only putting forth his claim to attention by showing his patient assiduity in the pursuit of wisdom, and how that he adopted a particular method of teaching. For the idea contained in the verb <span class="accented">taqan</span>, "to place or make straight" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>), applied to literary composition, Delitzsch compares the German word for" author" (<span class="accented">Schriftsteller</span>). The notion of the <span class="accented">mashal</span> being similitude, comparison, the writer's pondering and searching were needed to discover hidden analogies, and, by means of the known and familiar, to lead up to the more obscure and abstruse. The Septuagint has a curious and somewhat unintelligible rendering, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "And the ear will trace out the order of parables," which Schleusner translates, "elegantes parabolas." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:8-14 Solomon repeats his text, VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY. These are the words of one that could speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world, which can do nothing to ease men of the burden of sin. As he considered the worth of souls, he gave good heed to what he spake and wrote; words of truth will always be acceptable words. The truths of God are as goads to such as are dull and draw back, and nails to such as are wandering and draw aside; means to establish the heart, that we may never sit loose to our duty, nor be taken from it. The Shepherd of Israel is the Giver of inspired wisdom. Teachers and guides all receive their communications from him. The title is applied in Scripture to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The prophets sought diligently, what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. To write many books was not suited to the shortness of human life, and would be weariness to the writer, and to the reader; and then was much more so to both than it is now. All things would be vanity and vexation, except they led to this conclusion, That to fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole of man. The fear of God includes in it all the affections of the soul towards him, which are produced by the Holy Spirit. There may be terror where there is no love, nay, where there is hatred. But this is different from the gracious fear of God, as the feelings of an affectionate child. The fear of God, is often put for the whole of true religion in the heart, and includes its practical results in the life. Let us attend to the one thing needful, and now come to him as a merciful Saviour, who will soon come as an almighty Judge, when he will bring to light the things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of all hearts. Why does God record in his word, that ALL IS VANITY, but to keep us from deceiving ourselves to our ruin? He makes our duty to be our interest. May it be graven in all our hearts. Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all that concerns man.</body></html>
