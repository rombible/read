To the English reader the "grinders" of our version suggest "teeth" in a way that the "grinding maidens" of the Hebrew does not; and the ladies looking out of the lattices can easily be understood of "the eyes." But when it is attempted to carry out the figure, and to find anatomical explanations of all the other images employed, the interpretation becomes so forced that some have preferred to understand <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm" title="In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a> as only a general description of the consternation produced by such a tempest as is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm" title="While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>. I cannot but think that the "house" does denote the bodily frame; but I regard as unsuccessful the attempts which have been made to carry out this idea into its details.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The gradual decay which creeps over the body, the habitation of the spirit, is depicted under the figure of a house and its parts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm">2 Peter 1:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this is the case when, etc. The hands and arms are appropriately called the keepers of the house, for with them (as Volek quotes from Galen) man <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> ("arms and guards his body in various ways"). The shaking and palsy of old men's limbs are thus graphically described. This would be one of the first symptoms discerned by an observer. Taking the alternative interpretation, we should see in these "keepers" the menservants who keep watch before the house. These menials are appalled by the approach of the tempest, and quake. <span class="cmt_word">And the strong men shall bow themselves.</span> The "men of power" are the legs, or the bones generally, which in the young are "as pillars of marble" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-15.htm">Song of Solomon 5:15</a>), but in the old become feeble, slack, and bent. Delitzsch quotes 3Macc. 4:5, where we read of a multitude of old men being driven mercilessly, "stooping from age, and dragging their feet heavily along." In this clause it is this stooping and bending of the body that is noticed, when men are no longer upright in stature, "swifter than eagles," "stronger than lions" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>), fit for war and active employment. It is therefore less appropriate to see in the "keepers" the legs, and in the "strong men" the arms. Otherwise, the latter are the masters, the wealthy and noble, in contradistinction to the menials before mentioned: both lords and servants are equally terrified at the approach of the tempest, or, as Wright would say, at the touch of the sickly season (see on ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">And the grinders cease because they are few</span>. The word for "grinders" is feminine (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "the grinding-women," Septuagint), doubtless because grinding was especially women's business (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a>). By them are meant the teeth, as we speak of <span class="accented">molars</span>, though, of course, the term here applies to all the teeth; so the Greeks used the term <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> for the <span class="accented">denies molares</span>. These, becoming few in number and no longer continuous, cannot perform their office. Otherwise, the grinding-women leave their work or pause in their labors at the approach of the storm, though one does not quite see why they should be fewer than usual, unless the sickly season has prostrated most of their companions, or that many are too frightened to ply their task. Having, therefore, harder work than usual, they stop at times to recruit themselves. But the analogy rather breaks down here; one would be inclined to suppose that their decreased numbers would make them apply themselves more assiduously to their necessary occupation. As the "keepers" in the former part of the verse were slaves, so these grinders are slaves, such occupation being the lowest form of service (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Those that look out of the windows be darkened.</span> These are the eyes that look forth from the cavities in which they are sunk; they are regarded as the windows of the bodily structure, the eyelashes or eyelids possibly being deemed the lattice of the same. Plumptre cites Cicero, ' De Nat. Deer.,' 2:140: "Sensus interpretes ac nuntii return, in capite, tamquam in arce, mirifice ad usus necessaries et facti et collocati sunt. Nam oculi, tamquam speculatores, altissimum locum obtinent; ex quo plurima conspicientes, fungantur sue munere." The dimness in the eye and the failing in the powers of sight are well expressed by the terms of the text. It is noted of Moses, as something altogether abnormal, that at a hundred and twenty years of age "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>). Taking the alternative interpretation, we must regard those that look out of the windows as the ladies of the house, who have no menial work to do, and employ their time in gazing idly from the lattices (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6</a>). These "are darkened," they are terror-stricken, their faces gather blackness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>), or they retire into corners in terror of the storm. These women are parallel to "the strong men" mentioned above; so that the weather affects all of every class - men-servants and maidservants, lords and ladies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-7 We should remember our sins against our Creator, repent, and seek forgiveness. We should remember our duties, and set about them, looking to him for grace and strength. This should be done early, while the body is strong, and the spirits active. When a man has the pain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin and worldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them, renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurative description of old age and its infirmities, which has some difficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are a figurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany old age, ver. 6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hour of death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmities would not have been known. Surely then the aged should reflect on the evil of sin.</body></html>
