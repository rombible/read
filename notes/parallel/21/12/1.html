The word for "Creator" is the participle of the Verb <span class="accented">barn</span>, which is that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, etc., describing God's work. It is plural in form, like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, the plural being that of majesty or excellence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). It is used here as an appellation of God, because the young have to bethink themselves that all they are and all they have come from God. Such plurals are supposed by some to be divinely intended to adumbrate the doctrine of the Holy Trinity - a dark saying containing a mystery which future revelation shoed explain. "He that made thee" is a common phrase in Ecclesiasticus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a>; 7:30; 39:5). It is to be noted that Gratz reads "cistern" or a fountain" in place of "Creator," and explains this term to mean "wife, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-18</a>. But the alteration has nothing to support it, and is most unnecessary, though Cheyne was inclined to adopt it ('Job and Solomon,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">While the evil days come not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before they come. "Days of evil; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>); <span class="accented">tempus afflictionis</span> (Vulgate). The phrase refers to the grievances and inconveniences of old age, which are further and graphically described in the following verses, though whether the expressions therein used regard literal anatomical facts, or are allegorical representations of the gradual decay of the faculties, has been greatly disputed. Probably both opinions contain a partial truth, as will be noted in our Exposition. Ginsburg considers that the allusion is not to the ills that in the course of time all flesh is heir to, but rather to that premature decay and suffering occasioned by the unrestrained gratification of sensual passions, such as Cicero intimates ('De Senect.,' 9:29), "Libidinosa et intemperans adulescentia effetum corpus tradit senectuti." There is nothing specially in the text to support this view, and it is most reasonable to see here generally a figurative description of decay, whatever may be the cause. <span class="cmt_word">I have no pleasure in them.</span> Ere the time comes when a man shall say, "I have no pleasure in life." Thus the aged Barzillai asks," Can I discern between good and evil? Can thy servant taste what I eat, or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing-men and singing-women?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-7 We should remember our sins against our Creator, repent, and seek forgiveness. We should remember our duties, and set about them, looking to him for grace and strength. This should be done early, while the body is strong, and the spirits active. When a man has the pain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin and worldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them, renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurative description of old age and its infirmities, which has some difficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are a figurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany old age, ver. 6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hour of death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmities would not have been known. Surely then the aged should reflect on the evil of sin.</body></html>
