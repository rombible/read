Leaving this life of self-indulgence, he takes to art and culture, the details being drawn from the accounts of the historical Solomon. <span class="cmt_word">I made me great works</span>; literally, I made <span class="accented">great my works</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;</span> <span class="accented">per</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Magnificavi opera mea</span>. Among these works the temple, with all its wonderful structural preparations, is not specially mentioned, perhaps because no one could think of Solomon without connecting his name with this magnificent building, and it was superfluous to call attention to it; or else because the religious aspect of his operations is not here in question, but only his taste and pursuit of beauty. But the omission tells strongly against the Solomonic authorship of the book. <span class="cmt_word">I builded me houses.</span> Solomon had a passion for erecting magnificent buildings. We have various accounts of his works of this nature in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. and 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a>. There was the huge palace for himself, which occupied thirteen years in building; there was the "house of the forest of Lebanon," a splendid hall constructed with pillars of cedar; the porch of pillars; the hall of judgment; the harem for the daughter of Pharaoh. Then there were fortresses, store-cities, chariot-towns, national works of great importance; cities in distant lands which he founded, such as Tadmor in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">I planted me vineyards</span>. David had vineyards and olive yards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27, 28</a>), which passed into the possession of his son; and we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a> of a vineyard that Solomon had in Baal-hamon, which some identify with Belamon (Judith 8:3), a place near Shunem, in the Plain of Esdraelon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
