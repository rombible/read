Their guesses are so numerous that it would be wearisome to recount them. That adopted in our version is by no means one of the most probable. The interpretation "concubines" is most in favour with commentators, though they differ among themselves as to the grounds on which they justify this translation. And it does appear unlikely that this notorious feature of Solomon's court should be omitted in an enumeration of his luxury. It will be seen from the margin that the words "of all sorts" have nothing corresponding to them in the original, but are intended as an equivalent for a Hebrew idiom, in which a plural is intensified by prefixing a noun in the singular.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gathered me also silver and gold</span>. Much is said of the wealth of the historical Solomon, who had all his vessels of gold, armed his body-guard with golden shields, sat on an ivory throne overlaid with gold, received tribute and presents of gold from all quarters, sent his navies to distant lands to import precious metals, and made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces</span>. The word rendered "the provinces" (<span class="accented">hammedinoth</span>), in spite of the article, seems to mean, not the twelve districts into which Solomon divided his kingdom for fiscal and economical purposes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>, etc.), but countries generally exterior to Palestine, with which he had commercial or political relations, and which sent to him the productions for which they were each most celebrated. So the districts of the Persian empire were required to furnish the monarch with a certain portion of their chief commodities. His friendship with Hiram of Tyro brought him into connection with the Phoeni-clans, the greatest commercial nation of antiquity, and through them he accumulated riches and stores from distant and various lands beyond the limits of the Mediterranean Sea. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">medinah</span>) occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-14.htm">1 Kings 20:14</a>, etc.; but is found elsewhere only in exilian or post-exilian books (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>, etc.). The "kings" may be the tributary monarchs, such as those of Arabia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>); or the expression in the text may imply simply such treasure as only kings, and not private persons, could possess. <span class="cmt_word">Men-singers and women-singers.</span> These, of course, are not the choir of the temple, of which women formed no part, bur. musicians introduced at banquets and social festivals, to enhance the pleasures of the scene. They are mentioned in David's days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>) and later (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; Ecclus. 35:5 Ecclus. 49:1). The females who took part in these performances were generally of an abandoned class; hence the, warning of Ben-Sira, "Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts" (Ecclus. 9:4). Such exhibitions were usually accompanied with dancing, the character of which in Eastern countries is well known. The Jews, as time went on, learned to tolerate many customs and practices, imported often from other lands, which tended to lower morality and self-respect. <span class="cmt_word">And the delights of the sons of men;</span> the sensual pleasures that men enjoy. The expression is euphemistic (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-6.htm">Song of Solomon 7:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Musical instruments, and that of all sorts</span> (<span class="accented">shiddah veshiddoth</span>). The word (given here first in the singular number and then in the plural emphatically to express multitude) occurs nowhere else, and has, therefore, been subjected to various interpretations. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "a male cupbearer and female cupbearers;" and so the Syrian and. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Scyphos et urceos in ministerio ad vina fundenda</span> - which introduces rather a bathos into the description. After the clause immediately preceding, one might expect mention of Solomon's numerous harem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>), and most modern commentators consider the word to mean "concubine," the whole expression denoting multiplicity, "wife and wives." The Authorized Version is not very probable, though somewhat supported by Kimchi, Luther, etc., and the Greek Venetian, which has, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, a musical term signifying "combination of tones," or harmony. Other interpretations are "captives," "litters," "coaches," "baths," "treasures," "chests," "demons." Ewald, followed by Motais and others, suggests that the word implies a strong or high degree of a quality, so that, connecting the two clauses together, we should render, "And in a word, all the delights of the sons of men in abundance." This seems a more appropriate termination to the catalogue than any specification of further sources of pleasure; but there is no very strong etymological reason to recommend it; and we can hardly suppose that, in the enumeration of Solomon's prodigalities, his multitudinous seraglio would be omitted. Rather it comes in here naturally as the climax and completion of his pursuit of earthly delight. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
