The noun is peculiar to this book. The corresponding verb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm" title="If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm" title="In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-5.htm" title="And said, If it please the king, and if I have favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:">Esther 8:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom.</span> "In," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>, "with," directed and performed with wisdom. The author speaks of himself objectively, as St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>) says, "I know a man in Christ," etc. His complaint now is, not that his successor may misuse his inheritance (ver. 19), but that this person shall have that on which he has bestowed no skill or toil, shall enjoy what modern phraseology terms "unearned increment." This, which was set forth as One of the blessings of the promised land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10, 11</a>), Koheleth cannot bear to contemplate where it touches himself - not from envy or grudging, but from the feeling of dissatisfaction and want of energy which it generates. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> (<span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>knowledge and in</span> (<span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>equity</span>. <span class="accented">Kishron</span>, translated "equity" in the Authorized Version; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "manliness," in the Septuagint: and <span class="accented">sollicitudine</span> in the Vulgate, seems rather here to signify "skill" or "success."

The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.</body></html>
