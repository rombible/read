There seems to be no special reference to Rehoboam, but only the assertion of the general principle that the wisest of men must leave all that his labour has gained to be enjoyed by another who may be destitute of wisdom. The thought is not so much that it is a hardship for the wise man to leave what he has gained, as that it is that he should have no advantage over the fool who enjoys the same without any merit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Such had been his general view of men's actions; he now brings the thought home to his own case, which makes his distress more poignant. <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun.</span> He is disgusted to reflect upon all the trouble he has taken in life, when he thinks of what will become of the productions of his genius and the treasures which he has amassed. <span class="cmt_word">Because I should leave it</span> (my labor, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">its</span> results) <span class="cmt_word">unto the man that shall be after me</span>. It is impossible that Solomon could thus have spoken of Rehoboam; and to suppose that he wrote thus after Jeroboam's attempt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>, etc.), and in contemplation of a possible usurper, is not warranted by any historical statement, the absolute security of the succession being all along expected, and the growing discontent being perfectly unknown to, or contemptuously disregarded by, the king. The sentiment is general, and recurs more than once; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>.

The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.</body></html>
