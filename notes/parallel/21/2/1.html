The Vulgate misses the direct address to the heart, which the words, rightly interpreted, imply, translating, <span class="accented">Vadam et offluam delieiis</span>. The Septuagint correctly gives, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. It is like the rich fool's language in Christ's parable, "I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-10.htm">Luke 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore enjoy pleasure;</span> literally, <span class="accented">see good</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>). "To see" is often used figuratively in the sense of "to experience, or enjoy." Wright compares the expressions, "see death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm">Luke 2:26</a>), "see life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>). We may find the like in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-32.htm">Jeremiah 29:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>). The king now tries to find the <span class="accented">summum bonum</span> in pleasure, in selfish enjoyment without thought of others. Commentators, as they saw Stoicism in the first chapter, so read Epieureanism into this. We shall have occasion to refer to this idea further on (see on Ecclesiastes 3:22). Of this new experiment the result was the same as before. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, this also is vanity</span>. This experience is confirmed in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
