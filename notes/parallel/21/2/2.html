He uses the term "mad" in reference to the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>, "I gave my heart to know madness and folly." Septuagint, "I said to laughter, Error (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Risum reputavi errorem</span>. Neither of these is as accurate as the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Of mirth, What doeth it?</span> What does it effect towards real happiness and contentment? How does it help to fill the void, to give lasting satisfaction? So we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>, "Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of mirth is heaviness;" though the context is different. The Vulgate renders loosely, <span class="accented">Quid frustra deeiperis?</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
