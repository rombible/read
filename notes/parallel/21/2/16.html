Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's Hebrew 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) It might be urged on behalf of the Solomonic authorship that Solomon himself might imagine that in the days to come he and his wisdom would be forgotten, but that such a thought does not become a long subsequent writer who had been induced by Solomon's reputation for wisdom to make him the hero of his work. It would seem to follow that the writer is here only giving the history of Solomon's reflections, and not his ultimate conclusions. Better to omit the note of interrogation after "wise man," and put a note of exclamation after "fool," the "how" being used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm" title="That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!">Isaiah 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-17.htm" title="And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, How are you destroyed, that were inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which were strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!">Ezekiel 26:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever</span>; Revised Version, more emphatically, for <span class="accented">of the wise man</span>, <span class="accented">even as of the fool</span>, <span class="accented">there is no remembrance forever</span>. This, of course, is not absolutely true. There are men whose names are history, and will endure as long as the world lasts; but speaking generally, oblivion is the portion of all; posterity soon forgets the wisdom of one and the folly of another. Where the belief in the future life was not a strong and animating motive, posthumous fame exercised a potent attraction for many minds. To be the founder of a long line of descendants, -r to leave a record which should be fresh in the minds of future generations, these were objects of intense ambition, and valued as worthy of highest aspirations and best efforts. The words of classical poets will occur to our memory; e.g. Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:30. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Exegi monumentum aere perennius...<br />Non omnis metier, multaque pars mei<br />Vitabit Libitinam."</span> Ovid, '<span class="accented">Amor</span>.,' 1:15. 4 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ergo etiam, cum me supremus adederit ignis,<br />Vivam, parsquc mei multa supersteserit."</span> But Koheleth shows the vanity of all such hopes; they are based on sounds which experience proves to be unsubstantial. Though Solomon's own fame gives the lie to the statement received without limitation (comp. Wisd. 8:13), yet his reflections might well have taken this turn, and the writer is quite justified in putting the thought into his mouth, as the king could not know how subsequent ages would regard his wisdom and attainments. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten</span>. The clause has been variously translated. Septuagint, "Forasmuch as the coming days, even all the things, are forgotten;" Vulgate, "And future times shall cover all things equally with oblivion." Modern editors give, "Since in the days that are to come they are all forgotten;" "As in time past, so in days to come, all will be forgotten.... In the days which are coming [it will be said by-and-by], The whole of them are long ago forgotten.'" This is a specimen of the uncertainty of exact interpretation, where the intended meaning is well ascertained. "<span class="accented">All"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span>) may refer either to wise and foolish, or to the circumstances of their lives. <span class="cmt_word">And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</span> Better taken as one sentence, with an exclamation, <span class="accented">How doth the wise man die with</span> (<span class="accented">even</span> as) <span class="accented">the fool I</span> (For "with" (<span class="accented">ira</span>), equivalent to "as," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>.) "How" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;</span>) is sarcastic, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, or sorrowful, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>. The same complaint falls from a psalmist's lips, "He seeth that wise men die; the fool and the brutish together <span class="accented">perish"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>). So David laments the death of the murdered leader, "Should Abner die as a fool dieth?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-33.htm">2 Samuel 3:33</a>). Plumptre considers that the author of the Book of Wisdom expands this view with the design of exposing its fallacy, and introducing a better hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1-9</a>). But that writer would not have designated Solomon's sentiments as those of "<span class="accented">the</span> ungodly" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>), nor foisted these utterances of sensualists and materialists upon so honored a source. At the same time, it is only as being victims, <span class="accented">nil miserantis Opel</span>, the prey of the pitiless and indiscriminating grave, that the wise and foolish are placed in the same category. There is the widest difference between the death-beds of the two, as the experience of any one who has watched them will testify, the one happy with the consciousness of duty done honestly, however imperfectly, and bright with the hope of immortality; the other darkened by vain regrets and shrinking despair, or listless in brutish insensibility. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 Solomon found that knowledge and prudence were preferable to ignorance and folly, though human wisdom and knowledge will not make a man happy. The most learned of men, who dies a stranger to Christ Jesus, will perish equally with the most ignorant; and what good can commendations on earth do to the body in the grave, or the soul in hell? And the spirits of just men made perfect cannot want them. So that if this were all, we might be led to hate our life, as it is all vanity and vexation of spirit.</body></html>
