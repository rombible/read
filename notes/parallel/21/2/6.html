The place is probably the same as that called Etham by Josephus in his description of Solomon's luxury (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 7. 3). Josephus speaks of another Pool of Solomon (<span class= "ital">Bell. Jud. </span>v. 4. 2). Tanks are necessary for irrigation in a land where natural streams are few and are dried up in summer. The king's pool is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-14.htm" title="Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.">Nehemiah 2:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pools of water</span>. Great care was exercised by Solomon to provide his capital with water, and vast operations were undertaken for this purpose. "The king's pool," mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-14.htm">Nehemiah 2:14</a>, may have been constructed by him (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04. 2); but the most celebrated work ascribed to him is the water-supply at Etham, southwest of Bethlehem, and the aqueduct leading from thence to Jerusalem. Most modern travelers have described these pools. They are three in number, and, according to Robinson's measurement, are of immense size. The first, to the east, is 582 feet long, 207 wide, and 50 deep; the second, 432 by 250, and 39 feet deep; the third, 380 by 236, and 25 feet deep. They are all, however, narrower at the upper end, and widen out gradually, flowing one into the other. There is a copious spring led into the uppermost pool from the north-east, but this supply is augmented by other sources now choked and ruined. The water from the pools was conveyed round the ridge on which Bethlehem stands in earthen pipes to Jerusalem. Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 326) says, "Near that city it was carried along the west side of the Valley of Gihon to the north-western end of the lower Pool of Gihon, where it crossed to the east side, and, winding round the southern declivity of Zion below <span class="accented">Neby Daud</span>, finally entered the south-eastern corner of the temple area, where the water was employed in the various services of the sanctuary." Etham is, with good reason, identified with the beautiful valley of Urtas, which lies southwest of Bethlehem, in the immediate neighborhood of the pools of Solomon. The fountain near the present village watered the gardens and orchards which were planted here, the terraced hills around were covered with vines, figs, and olives, and the prospect must have been delightful and refreshing in that thirsty land. <span class="cmt_word">To water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in order to irrigate a wood sprouting forth trees</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a nursery of saplings. So we read how the Garden of Eden was watered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>) - a most necessary feature in Eastern countries, where streams and pools are not constructed for picturesque reasons, but for material uses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
