Solomon's love of gardens appears throughout the Canticles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-2.htm">Song of Solomon 6:2</a>, etc.). He had a king's garden on the slope of the hills south of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>); and Beth-hacchemm, "the House of the Vine," at Ain Karim, about six miles east of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>); and at Baal-hamon another extensive vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>). The word rendered "orchard" (<span class="accented">parder</span>) occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-13.htm">Song of Solomon 4:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>. It is a Persian word, and passed into the Greek form <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 1:2.7), meaning "a park" planted with forest and fruit trees, and containing herds of animals. It is probably derived from the Zend <span class="accented">oairidaeza</span>," an enclosure." (For the trees in such parks, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-13.htm">Song of Solomon 4:13, 14</a>; and for an estimate of Solomon's works, Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:07. 3.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
