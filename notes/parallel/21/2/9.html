This refers to the magnificence and extent of his possessions and luxury, as the former passage to the surpassing excellence of his wisdom. We may compare the mention of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-13.htm">Genesis 26:13</a>), "The man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great" (<span class="accented">sc</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Also my wisdom remained with me</span>; <span class="accented">perseveravit mecum</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (Septuagint). In accordance with the purpose mentioned in ver. 3, he retained command of himself, studying philosophically the effects and nature of the pleasures of which he partook, and keeping ever in view the object of his pursuit. Voluptuousness was not the end which he sought, but one of the means to obtain the end; and what he calls his wisdom is not pure Divine wisdom that comes from above, but an earthly prudence and self-restraint. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
