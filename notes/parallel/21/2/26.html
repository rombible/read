The subject "God" is not, in the Hebrew, an omission which is supposed to justify its virtual insertion in ver. 25. The Vulgate boldly supplies it here, <span class="accented">Homini bone in conspectu sue dedit Deus</span>. To the man that finds favor in God's sight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who pleases him, ha gives blessings, while he withholds them or takes them away from the man who displeases him. The blessings specified are <span class="cmt_word">wisdom, and knowledge, and joy.</span> The only true wisdom which is not grief, the only true knowledge which is not sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>), and the only joy in life, are the gifts of God to those whom he regards as good. <span class="cmt_word">But to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up.</span> The sinner takes great pains, expends continuous labor, that he may amass wealth, but it passes into other. (more worthy) hands. Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:14. 25 - "Absumet heres Caecuba dignior Servata centum clavibus." The moral government of God is here recognized, as below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15, 17</a>, etc., and a further thought is added on the subject of retribution: <span class="cmt_word">That he may give to him that is good before God</span>. This idea is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>, "He that augmenteth his substance by usury and increase, gathereth it for him that hath pity upon the poor;" and Ecclesiastes 13:22, "The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16, 17</a>). So in the parable of the talents, the talent of the unprofitable servant is given unto him who had made best use of his money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-28.htm">Matthew 25:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This also is vanity</span>. It is a question what is the reference here. Delitzsch considers it to be the striving after pleasure in and from labor (ver. 24); Knobel, the arbitrary distribution of the good things of this life; but, put thus baldly, this could hardly be termed a "feeding on wind;" nor could that expression be applied to the "gifts of God" to which Bullock confines the reference. Wright, Hengstenberg, Gratz, and others deem that what is meant is the collecting and heaping up of riches by the sinner, which has already been decided to be vanity (vers. 11, 17, 18); and this Would limit the general conclusion to a particular instance. Taking the view contained in ver. 24 as the central idea of the passage, we see that Koheleth feels that the restriction upon man's enjoyment of labor imposed by God's moral government makes that toil vain because its issue is not in men's hands, and it is a striving for or a feeding on wind because the result is unsatisfying and vanishes in the grasp. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-26 Our hearts are very loth to quit their expectations of great things from the creature; but Solomon came to this at length. The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.</body></html>
