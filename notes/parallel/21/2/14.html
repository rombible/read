The wise man has the eyes of his heart or understanding enlightened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>); he looks into the nature of things, fixes his regard on what is most important, sees where to go; while the fool's eyes are in the ends of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-24.htm">Proverbs 17:24</a>); he walks on still in darkness, stumbling as he goes, knowing not whither his road shall take him. <span class="cmt_word">And I myself also</span> (<span class="accented">I even I</span>) <span class="cmt_word">perceived that one event happeneth to them all.</span> "Event" (<span class="accented">mikreh</span>); <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">interitus</span> (Vulgate); not chance, But death, the final event. The word is translated "hap" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>, and "chance" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>; but the connection here points to a definite termination; nor would it be consistent with Koheleth's religion to refer this termination to fate or accident. With all his experience, he could only conclude that in one important aspect the observed superiority of wisdom to folly was illusory and vain. He saw with his own eyes, and needed no instructor to teach, that both wise and fool must succumb to death, the universal leveler. Horace, in many passages, sings of this: thus 'Carm.,' 2:3. 21 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho,<br />Nil interest, an pauper et infima<br />De gente sub dive moreris,<br />Victima nil miserantis Orci."</span> (Comp, ibid, 1:28. 15, etc.; 2:14. 9, etc.) Plato ('Phaedo,' 57. p. 108, A) refers to a passage in 'Telephus,' a lost play of 2 Eschylus, which is restored thus - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"A single path leads all unto the grave."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 Solomon found that knowledge and prudence were preferable to ignorance and folly, though human wisdom and knowledge will not make a man happy. The most learned of men, who dies a stranger to Christ Jesus, will perish equally with the most ignorant; and what good can commendations on earth do to the body in the grave, or the soul in hell? And the spirits of just men made perfect cannot want them. So that if this were all, we might be led to hate our life, as it is all vanity and vexation of spirit.</body></html>
