The lust of the eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>), all that he saw and desired, he took measures to obtain.

This was the reason why he <span class="cmt_word">withheld not his heart from any joy</span>; kept it, as it were, ready to taste any pleasure which his exertions might obtain. <span class="cmt_word">This was my portion of all my labor</span>. Such joy was that which he won from his labor, he had his reward, such as it was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>). This term "portion" (<span class="accented">cheleq</span>) recurs often (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ver. 21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>, etc.; so Wisd. 2:9) in the sense of the result obtained by labor or con-duet. And what a meagre and unsatisfying result it was which he gained! Contrast the apostle's teaching, "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the vain-glory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16, 17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.</body></html>
