This further explains, without any metaphor, the injunction of beneficence in ver. 1. Give portions of thy "bread" to any number of those who need. Delitzsch and others who interpret the passage of maritime enterprise would see in it a recommendation (like the proceeding of Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-16.htm">Genesis 32:16</a>, etc.) not to risk all at once, to divide one's ventures into various ships. But the expression in the text is merely a mode of enjoining unlimited benevolence. The numbers are purposely indefinite. Instances of this form of speech are common enough (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7-9</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>; Ecclus. 23:16 Ecclus. 26:5, 28). Wordsworth notes that the word for "<span class="accented">portion"</span> (<span class="accented">chelek</span>) is that used specially for the portion of the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>); and in accordance with his view of the date of the book, finds here an injunction not to confine one's offerings to the Levites of Judah, but to extend them to the refugees who come from Israel. <span class="cmt_word">For thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</span> A time may come when you yourself may need help; the power of giving may no longer be yours; therefore make friends now who may be your comfort in distress. So the Lord urges, "Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>). It seems a low motive on which to base charitable actions; but men act on such secondary motives every day, and the moralist cannot ignore them. In the Book of Proverbs secondary and worldly motives are largely urged as useful in the conduct of life (see the Introduction to Proverbs, pp. 8, 9.). St. Paul reminds us that we some day may need a brother's help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The Fathers have spiritualized the passage, so as to make it of Christian application, far away indeed from Koheleth's thought. Thus St. Gregory: "By the number <span class="accented">seven</span> is understood the whole of this temporal condition... this is shown more plainly when the number <span class="accented">eight</span> is mentioned after it. For when another number besides follows after seven, it is set forth by this very addition, that this temporal state is brought to an end and closed by eternity. For by the number <span class="accented">seven</span> Solomon expressed the present time, which is passed by periods of seven days. But by the number <span class="accented">eight</span> he designated eternal life, which the Lord made known to us by his resurrection. For he rose in truth on the Lord's day, which, as following the seventh day, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sabbath, is found to be the eighth from the creation. But it is well said, 'Give portions,' etc. As if it were plainly said, 'So dispense temporal goods, as not to forget to desire those that are eternal. For thou oughtest to provide for the future by well-doing, who knowest not what tribulation succeeds from the future judgment'" ('Moral,' 35:17, Oxford transl.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 Solomon presses the rich to do good to others. Give freely, though it may seem thrown away and lost. Give to many. Excuse not thyself with the good thou hast done, from the good thou hast further to do. It is not lost, but well laid out. We have reason to expect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in the day of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefit others. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where the providence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work to do, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every little difficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never go on, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulation are, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree with his word, whether we see it or not. And we may well trust God to provide for us, without our anxious, disquieting cares. Be not weary in well-doing, for in due season, in God's time, you shall reap, Ga 6:9.</body></html>
