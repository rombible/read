(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-6.htm" title="That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.">John 3:6</a>.) The word for "her that is with child" occurs in that sense here only in the Old Testament, and in later Hebrew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit.</span> In this verse are presented one or two examples of man's ignorance of natural facts and processes as analogous to the mysteries of God's moral government. The word translated "spirit" (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) may mean also "wind," and is so taken here by many commentators (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). In this view there would be two instances given, viz. the wind and the embryo. Certainly, the mention of the wind seems to come naturally after what has preceded; and man's ignorance of its way, and powerlessness to control it, are emblematic of his attitude towards Divine providence. The versions, however, seem to support the rendering of the Authorized Version. Thus the Septuagint (which connects the clause with ver. 4), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> ("among whom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who watch the weather), "There is none that knoweth what is the way of the spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate. <span class="accented">Quomodo ignoras quae sit via spiritus</span>. If we take this view, we have only one idea in the verse, and that is the infusion of the breath of life in the embryo, and its growth in its mother's womb. <span class="cmt_word">Nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child</span>. Our version, by its insertions, has made two facts out of the statement in the Hebrew, which is literally, <span class="accented">holy the bones</span> (are) <span class="accented">in the womb of a pregnant woman</span>. Septuagint, "As (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>) bones are in the womb," etc.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et qua ratione compingantur ossa in ventre praegnantis, "</span> And in what way the bones are framed in the womb of the pregnant." The formation and quickening of the foetus were always regarded as mysterious and inscrutable (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>; Wisd. 7:1, etc.). Wright compares M. Aurelius, 10:26, "The first principles of life are extremely slender and mysterious; and yet nature works them up into a strange increase of bulk, diversity, and proportion." Controversies concerning the origin of the soul have been rife from early times, some holding what is called Traducianism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that soul and body are both derived by propagation from earthly parents; others supporting Creationism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the soul, created specially by God, is infused into the child before birth. St. Augustine confesses ('Op. Imperf.,' 4:104) that he is unable to determine the truth of either opinion. And, indeed, this is one of those secret things which Holy Scripture has not decided for us, and about which no authoritative sentence has been given. The term "bones" is used for the whole conformation of the body (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>); <span class="accented">meleah</span>, "pregnant," means literally, "full," and is used like the Latin <span class="accented">plena</span> can here and nowhere else in the Old Testament, though common in later Hebrew. Thus Ovid, 'Metam.,' 10:469 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Plena patris thalamis excedit, et impia dire<br />Semina fert utero."</span> And 'Fast.,' 4:633 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nunc gravidum pecus est; gravidae sunt semine terrae<br />Telluri plenae victima plena datur."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</span> Equally mysterious in its general scope and in its details is the working of God's providence. And as everything lies in God's hands, it must needs be secret and beyond human ken. This is why to "the works of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>) is added, "who maketh all." The God of nature is Lord of the future (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; Ecclus. 18:6); man must not disquiet himself about this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 Solomon presses the rich to do good to others. Give freely, though it may seem thrown away and lost. Give to many. Excuse not thyself with the good thou hast done, from the good thou hast further to do. It is not lost, but well laid out. We have reason to expect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in the day of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefit others. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where the providence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work to do, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every little difficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never go on, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulation are, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree with his word, whether we see it or not. And we may well trust God to provide for us, without our anxious, disquieting cares. Be not weary in well-doing, for in due season, in God's time, you shall reap, Ga 6:9.</body></html>
