From the uncertainty of the results of human effort, he infers that we ought the more diligently to make trial of varied forms of exertion, in order that this or that may succeed. From the instability of human happiness, he draws the lesson that we ought to enjoy freely such happiness as life affords, yet with a temperate and chastened joy, and mindful of the account we shall have to render. The most popular explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm" title="Cast your bread on the waters: for you shall find it after many days.">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a> is, that the figure is taken from the casting of seed on irrigated lands, as, for instance, in Egypt before the waters of the Nile have subsided; and that the duty of beneficence is here inculcated. We are to sow our benefits broadcast, and be assured we shall have a harvest of reward. It is easier to raise objections to this interpretation than to improve on it. That the word translated "bread" is sometimes used in the sense of seed corn, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm" title="Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.">Isaiah 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-23.htm" title="Then shall he give the rain of your seed, that you shall sow the ground with; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall your cattle feed in large pastures.">Isaiah 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm" title="He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;">Psalm 104:14</a>. It is objected that the words "cast on the waters" are, literally, "send over the face of the waters," the word "send" being nowhere else used in the sense of sowing. It has been remarked that in the East bread is used in the shape of light cakes, which would float on water; and the text has been understood as directing the casting of such cakes into a running stream--an irrational proceeding, not likely to occur to any but one to whom this text might have suggested it, and not offering ground for expectation that he who so cast his bread would find it again. It has been less absurdly proposed to understand the text as advising maritime enterprise; but the word "bread" does not harmonise with this explanation. There is nothing else in the book according with such advice; and the next verse, about "the evil that shall be <span class= "ital">upon the earth," </span>shows that the writer was not thinking of the dangers of the sea. I believe, therefore, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm" title="In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>, which speaks distinctly of the sowing of seed, is the best commentary on the present verse, which means, cast thy seed, even though thou canst not see where it will fall. Possibly the application of the figure is not to be restricted to acts of beneficence; but the next verse may lead us to think that these are primarily intended, and to these especially the encouragement at the end of the verse applies; for in other cases this book gives a less cheerful view of the possible success of human plans.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - Section 16. Leaving alone unanswerable questions, man's duty and happiness are found in activity, especially in doing all the good in his power, for he knows not how soon he himself may stand in need of help. This is <span class="accented">the first remedy for the perplexities of life</span>. The wise man will not charge himself with results. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast thy bread upon the waters.</span> The old interpretation of this passage, which found in it a reference to the practice in Egypt of sowing seed during the inundation of the Nile, is not admissible. The verb <span class="accented">shalaeh</span> is not used in the sense of sowing or scattering seed; it means "to cast or send forth." Two chief explanations have been given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As to sow on the water is equivalent to taking thankless toil (compare the Greek proverb, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>), the gnome may be an injunction to do good without hope of return, like the evangelical precept (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32-35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is a commercial maxim, urging men to make ventures in trade, that they may receive a good return for their expenditure. In this case the casting seed upon the waters is a metaphorical expression for sending merchandise across the sea to distant lands. This view is supposed to be confirmed by the statement concerning the good woman in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-14.htm">Proverbs 31:14</a>, "She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her bread from far;" and the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do Business in great waters." But one sees no reason why Koheleth should suddenly turn to commerce and the trade of a maritime city. Such considerations have no reference to the context, nor to the general design of the book. Nothing leads to them, nothing comes of them. On the other hand, if we take the verse as urging active beneficence as the safest and best proceeding under men's present circumstances, We have a maxim in due accordance with the spirit of the rest of the work, and one which conduces to the conclusion reached at the end. So we adopt the first of the two explanations mentioned above. The bread in the East is made in the form of thin cakes, which would float for a time if thrown into a stream; and if it be objected that no one would be guilty of such an irrational action as flinging bread into the water, it may be answered that this is just the point aimed at. Do your kindnesses, exert yourself, in the most unlikely quarters, not thinking of gratitude or return, but only of duty. And yet surely a recompense will be made in some form or other. Thou shalt find it after many days. This is not to be the motive of our acts, but it will in the course of time be the result; and this thought may be an encouragement. In the Chaldee Version of parts of Ecclesiasticus there is extant a maxim identical with our verse, "Strew thy bread on the water and on the land, and thou shalt find it at the end of days" (Dukes, 'Rabb. Btumenl.,' p. 73). Parallels have been found in many quarters. Thus the Turk says, "Do good, throw it into the water; if the fish does not know it, God does." Herzfeld quotes Goethe - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Was willst du untersuchen,<br />Wohin die Milde fliesst!<br />Ins Wasser wirf deine Kuchen;<br />Wer weiss wet sie geniesst?"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Wouldst thou too narrowly inquire<br />Whither thy kindness goes!<br />Thy cake upon the water cast;<br />Whom it may feed who knows?"</span> Voltaire paraphrases the passage in his 'Precis de l'Ecclesiaste' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Repandez vos bienfaits avec magnificence,<br />Meme aux moins vertueux ne les refusez pas.<br />Ne vous informez pas de leur reconnoissance;<br />Il est grand, il est beau de faire des ingrats."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 Solomon presses the rich to do good to others. Give freely, though it may seem thrown away and lost. Give to many. Excuse not thyself with the good thou hast done, from the good thou hast further to do. It is not lost, but well laid out. We have reason to expect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in the day of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefit others. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where the providence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work to do, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every little difficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never go on, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulation are, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree with his word, whether we see it or not. And we may well trust God to provide for us, without our anxious, disquieting cares. Be not weary in well-doing, for in due season, in God's time, you shall reap, Ga 6:9.</body></html>
