It is hard to interpret the judgment spoken of in this verse of anything but future judgment, when we bear in mind how much of the book is taken up with the complaint that retribution does not take place in this life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth</span>. Koheleth continues to inculcate the duty of rational enjoyment. "In youth" is during youth; not in the exercise of, or by reason of, thy fresh, unimpaired powers. The author urges his hearers to begin betimes to enjoy the blessing with which God surrounds them. Youth is the season of innocent, unalloyed pleasure; then, if ever, casting aside all tormenting anxiety concerning an unknown future, one may, as it is called, enjoy life. <span class="cmt_word">Let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth.</span> Let the lightness of thy heart show itself in thy bearing and manner, even as it is said in Proverbs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>), "A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance." <span class="cmt_word">Walk in the ways of thine heart</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>). Where the impulses and thoughts of thy heart lead thee. The wording looks as if the personal identity, the "I," and the thought were distinct. We have a similar severance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>, only there the personality directs the thought, not the thought the "I," <span class="cmt_word">And in the sight of thine eyes.</span> Follow after that on which thy eyes fix their regard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>); for, as Job says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>), "The heart walketh after the eyes." The Septuagint, in deference to the supposed requirements of strict morality, has (at least according to the text of some manuscripts) modified the received reading, translating the passage thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "And walk in the ways of thine heart blameless, and not in the sight of thine eyes." But <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is omitted by A, C, S. Others besides the Seventy have felt doubts about the bearing of the passage, as though it recommended either unbridled license in youth, or at any rate an unhallowed Epicureanism. To counteract the supposed evil teaching, some have credited Koheleth with stern irony. He is not recommending pleasure, say they, but warning against it. "Go on your way," he cries, "do as you list, sow your wild oats, live dissolutely, but remember that retribution will some day overtake you." But the counsel is seriously intended, and is quite consistent with many other passages which teach the duty of enjoying life as man's lot and part (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>, etc.). The seeming opposition between the recommendation here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a> is easily reconciled. The injunction in the Pentateuch, which was connected with a ceremonial observance, ran thus: "Remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which ye used to go a-whoring." Here unlawful pleasures, contrary to the commandments, are forbidden; Ecclesiastes urges the pursuit of innocent pleasures, such as will stand scrutiny. Hoelemann, quoted by Wright, observes that this verse is the origin of a famous student-song of Germany, a stanza or two of which we may cite - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Gaudeamus igitur, juvenes dum sumus;<br />Post exactam juventutem, post melestam senectutem,<br />Nos habebit humus ....</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Vita nostra brevis est, brevi finietur,<br />Venit mors velociter, rapit nes atrociter,<br />Nemini parcotur."</span> It is not Epicureanism, even in a modified form, that is here encouraged. For moderate and lawful pleasure Koheleth has always uttered his sanction, but the pleasure is to be such as God allows. This is to be accepted with all gratitude in the present, as the future is wholly beyond our ken and our control; it is all that is placed in our power, and it is enough to make life more than endurable. And then to temper unmixed joy, to prove that he is not recommending mere sensuality, to correct any wrong impression which the previous utterances may have conveyed, the writer adds another thought, a somber reflection which shows the religious conclusion to which he is working up. <span class="cmt_word">But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment</span> (<span class="accented">mishpat</span>). It has been doubted what is meant by "judgment," whether present or future, men's or God's. It has been taken to mean - God will make thy excesses prove scourges, by bringing on thee sickness, poverty, a miserable old age; or these distresses come as the natural consequences of youthful sins; or obloquy shall follow thee, and thou shall meet with deserved censure from thy fellow-men. But every one must feel that the solemn ending of this paragraph points to something more grave and important than any such results as those mentioned above, something that is concerned with that indefinable future which is ever looming in the dim horizon. Nothing satisfies the expected conclusion but a reference to the eternal judgment in the world beyond the grave. Shadowy and incomplete as was Koheleth's view of this great assize, his sense of God's justice in the face of the anomalies of human life was so strong that he can unhesitatingly appeal to the conviction of a coming inquisition, as a motive for the guidance of action and conduct. That in other passages he constantly apprehends earthly retribution, as the Pentateuch taught, and as his countrymen had learned to expect (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17, 18</a>), is no argument that he is not here rising to a higher view. Rather, the fact that the doctrine of temporal reward and punishment is found by experience to fail in many cases (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>) has forced him to state his conclusion that this life is not the end of-everything, and that there is another existence in which actions shall be tried, justice done, retribution awarded. The statement is brief, for he knew nothing more than the fact, and could add nothing to it. His conception of the soul's condition in Sheol (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10</a>) seems to point to some other state or period for this final judgment; but whether a resurrection is to precede this awful trial is left in uncertainty here, as elsewhere in the Old Testament. Cheyne and some other critics consider this last clause to be an interpolation, because it appears to militate against previous utterances; but this argument is unreasonable, as the paragraph comes in quite naturally as the needed conclusion, and without it the section would halt and be incomplete. A similar allusion is contained in the epilogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). A correcter, who desired to remove all seeming contradictions and discrepancies from the work, would not have been satisfied with inserting this gloss, but would have displayed his remedial measures in other places. Of this proceeding, however, no traces are discernible by an unprejudiced eye. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:7-10 Life is sweet to bad men, because they have their portion in this life; it is sweet to good men, because it is the time of preparation for a better; it is sweet to all. Here is a caution to think of death, even when life is most sweet. Solomon makes an effecting address to young persons. They would desire opportunity to pursue every pleasure. Then follow your desires, but be assured that God will call you into judgment. How many give loose to every appetite, and rush into every vicious pleasure! But God registers every one of their sinful thoughts and desires, their idle words and wicked words. If they would avoid remorse and terror, if they would have hope and comfort on a dying bed, if they would escape misery here and hereafter, let them remember the vanity of youthful pleasures. That Solomon means to condemn the pleasures of sin is evident. His object is to draw the young to purer and more lasting joys. This is not the language of one grudging youthful pleasures, because he can no longer partake of them; but of one who has, by a miracle of mercy, been brought back in safety. He would persuade the young from trying a course whence so few return. If the young would live a life of true happiness, if they would secure happiness hereafter, let them remember their Creator in the days of their youth.</body></html>
