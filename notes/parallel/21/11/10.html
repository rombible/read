The <span class="accented">third remedy is piety</span>, and this ought to be practiced from one's earliest days; life should be so guided as not to offend the laws of the Creator and Judge, and virtue should not be postponed till the failure of faculties makes pleasure unattainable, and death closes the scene. The last days of the old man are beautifully described under certain images, metaphors, and analogies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart.</span> The writer reiterates his advice concerning cheerfulness, and then proceeds to inculcate early piety. <span class="accented">Kaas</span>, rendered "sorrow," has been variously understood. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">gram</span>; so the margin of the Authorized Version gives "anger," and that of the Revised Version "vexation," or "provocation." Wordsworth adopts this last meaning (relating to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-30.htm">1 Kings 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-22.htm">1 Kings 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>, etc., where, however, the signification is modified by the connection in which the word stands), and paraphrases, "Take heed lest you provoke God by the thoughts of your heart." Jerome affirms that in the term "anger" all perturbations of the mind are included - which seems rather forced. The word is better rendered, low spirits, moroseness, discontent. These feelings are to be put away from the mind by a deliberate act. <span class="cmt_word">Put away evil from thy flesh</span>. Many commentators consider that the evil here named is physical, not moral, the author enjoining his young disciple to take proper care of his body, not to weaken it on the one hand by asceticism, nor on the other by indulgence in youthful lusts. In this case the two clauses would urge the removal of what respectively affects the mind and body, the inner and outer man. But the ancient versions are unanimous in regarding the "evil" spoken of as moral. Thus the Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "wickedness;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">malitiam</span>. Similarly the Syriac and Targum. And according to our interpretation of the passage, such is the meaning here. It is a call to early piety and virtue, like that of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), "Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." Do not, says Koheleth, defile thy body by carnal sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>), which bring decay and sickness, and arouse the wrath of God against thee<span class="cmt_word">. For childhood and youth are vanity.</span> This time of youth soon passes away; the capacity for enjoyment is soon circumscribed; therefore use thy opportunities aright, remembering the end. The word for "youth" (<span class="accented">shacharuth</span>) occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament, and is probably connected with <span class="accented">shachon</span>, "black," used of hair in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-31.htm">Leviticus 13:31</a>. Hence it means the time of black hair, in contradistinction to the time when the hair has become grey. The explanation which refers it to the time of dawn (Psalm 110:8) seems to be erroneous, as it would then be identical with" childhood." The Septuagint renders it <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "folly;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">voluptas</span>, "pleasure;" the Syriac, "and not knowledge, but the word cannot be rightly thus translated. The two terms are childhood and manhood, the period during which the capacity for pleasure is fresh and strong. Its vanity is soon brought home; it is evanescent; it brings punishment. Thus Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I cast mine eyes around, and feel<br />There is a blessing wanting;<br />Too soon our hearts the truth reveal,<br />That joy is disenchanting."</span> And again - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When amid the world's delights,<br />How warm soe'er we feel a moment among them -<br />We find ourselves, when the hot blast hath blown,<br />Prostrate, and weak, and wretched."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:7-10 Life is sweet to bad men, because they have their portion in this life; it is sweet to good men, because it is the time of preparation for a better; it is sweet to all. Here is a caution to think of death, even when life is most sweet. Solomon makes an effecting address to young persons. They would desire opportunity to pursue every pleasure. Then follow your desires, but be assured that God will call you into judgment. How many give loose to every appetite, and rush into every vicious pleasure! But God registers every one of their sinful thoughts and desires, their idle words and wicked words. If they would avoid remorse and terror, if they would have hope and comfort on a dying bed, if they would escape misery here and hereafter, let them remember the vanity of youthful pleasures. That Solomon means to condemn the pleasures of sin is evident. His object is to draw the young to purer and more lasting joys. This is not the language of one grudging youthful pleasures, because he can no longer partake of them; but of one who has, by a miracle of mercy, been brought back in safety. He would persuade the young from trying a course whence so few return. If the young would live a life of true happiness, if they would secure happiness hereafter, let them remember their Creator in the days of their youth.</body></html>
