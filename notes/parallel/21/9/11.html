The fastest runner doesn't always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn't always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don't always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/ecclesiastes/9.htm">English Standard Version</a></span><br />Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Berean Study Bible</a></span><br />I saw something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; neither is the bread to the wise, nor the wealth to the intelligent, nor the favor to the skillful; rather, time and chance happen to all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">New American Standard Bible </a></span><br />I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/ecclesiastes/9.htm">King James Bible</a></span><br />I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race <i>is</i> not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/csb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Christian Standard Bible</a></span><br />Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, or bread to the wise, or riches to the discerning, or favor to the skillful; rather, time and chance happen to all of them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/cev/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Contemporary English Version</a></span><br />Here is something else I have learned: The fastest runners and the greatest heroes don't always win races and battles. Wisdom, intelligence, and skill don't always make you healthy, rich, or popular. We each have our own share of misfortune. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/gnt/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Good News Translation</a></span><br />I realized another thing, that in this world fast runners do not always win the races, and the brave do not always win the battles. The wise do not always earn a living, intelligent people do not always get rich, and capable people do not always rise to high positions. Bad luck happens to everyone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hcsb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Holman Christian Standard Bible</a></span><br />Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, or bread to the wise, or riches to the discerning, or favor to the skillful; rather, time and chance happen to all of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isv/ecclesiastes/9.htm">International Standard Version</a></span><br />I considered and observed on earth the following: The race doesn't go to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor food to the wise, nor wealth to the smart, nor recognition to the skilled. Instead, timing and circumstances meet them all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/net/ecclesiastes/9.htm">NET Bible</a></span><br />Again, I observed this on the earth: the race is not always won by the swiftest, the battle is not always won by the strongest; prosperity does not always belong to those who are the wisest, wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning, nor does success always come to those with the most knowledge--for time and chance may overcome them all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nheb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">New Heart English Bible</a></span><br />I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/gwt/ecclesiastes/9.htm">GOD'S WORD&reg; Translation</a></span><br />I saw something else under the sun. The race isn't [won] by fast runners, or the battle by heroes. Wise people don't necessarily have food.

Work as we may and must and ought, the results are uncertain and beyond our control. This he shows by his own personal experience. <span class="cmt_word">I returned, and saw under the sun.</span> The expression here does not indicate a new departure, but merely a repetition and confirmation of a previous thought - the dependence and conditionality of man. It implies, too, a correction of a possible misunderstanding of the injunction to labor, as if one's own efforts were sure to secure success. <span class="cmt_word">The race is not to the swift.</span> One is reminded of the fable of the hare and tortoise; but Koheleth's meaning is different. In the instances given he intimates that, though a man is well equipped for his work and uses all possible exertions, he may incur failure. So one may be a fleet runner, and yet, owing to some untoward accident or disturbing circumstance, not come in first. Thus Ahimaaz brought to David tidings of Absalom's defeat before Cushi, who had had the start of him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27, 31</a>). There is no occasion to invent an allusion to the foot-race in the formal Greek games. <span class="cmt_word">The battle to the strong.</span> Victory does not always accrue to mighty men, heroes. As David, himself an instance of the truth of the maxim, says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>), "The Lord saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither yet bread to the wise</span>. Wisdom will not ensure competency. To do this requires other endowments. Many a man of cultivated intellect and of high mental power is left to starve. <span class="cmt_word">Riches to men of understanding</span>. Aristophanes accounts for the unequal distribution of wealth thus ('Plutus,' 88), the god himself speaking- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I threatened, when a boy,<br />On none but just and wise and orderly<br />My favors to bestow; so Zeus in jealousy<br />Hath made me blind, that I may none of these Distinguish."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet favor to men of skill</span>. "Skill" here does not mean dexterity in handicrafts or arts, but knowledge generally; and the gnome says that reputation and influence do not necessarily accompany the possession of knowledge and learning; knowledge is not a certain or indispensable means to favor. Says the Greek gnomist - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Not prudence rules, but fortune, men's affairs."</span> That time and chance happeneth to them all. We have had the word <span class="accented">eth</span>, "time," all through <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. and elsewhere; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, rendered "chance," is uncommon, being found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a> (18, Hebrew). Everything has its proper season appointed by God, and man is powerless to control these arrangements. Our English word "chance" conveys an erroneous impression. What is meant is rather "incident," such as a calamity, disappointment, unforeseen occurrence. All human purposes are liable to be changed or controlled by circumstances beyond man's power, and incapable of explanation. A hand higher than man's disposes events, and success is conditioned by superior laws which work unexpected results. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11,12 Men's success seldom equals their expectations. We must use means, but not trust to them: if we succeed, we must give God the praise; if crossed, we must submit to his will. Those who put off the great concerns of their souls, are caught in Satan's net, which he baits with some worldly object, for which they reject or neglect the gospel, and go on in sin till they suddenly fall into destruction.</body></html>
