The "evil" is explained in the following words, which speak of the common fate. The Vulgate (followed by Ginsburg and others) lakes the first words as equivalent to a superlative: <span class="accented">Hoc est pessimum inter omnia</span>, "This is the greatest evil of all that is done under the sun." But the article would have been used in this case; nor would this accurately express Koheleth's sentiments. He looks upon death only as one of the evils appertaining to men's career on earth - one of the phases of that identity of treatment so certain and so inexplicable, which leads to disastrous results (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That there is one event unto all</span>. The "one event," as the end of the verse shows, is death. We have here the old strain repeated which is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; "Omnes eodem cogimur" (Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3. 25). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil.</span> In consequence of this indiscriminating destiny men sin recklessly, are encouraged in their wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Madness is in their heart while they live.</span> The "madness" is conduct opposed to the dictates of wisdom and reason, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:2, 12</a>. All their life long men follow their own lusts and passions, and care little for God's will and law, or their own best interests. This is well called "want of reason (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">And after that they go to the dead.</span> The verb is omitted in the Hebrew, being implied by the preposition XXX, "to;" the omission is very forcible. Delitzsch, Wright, and others render, "after him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after man's life is ended, which seems rather to say, "after they die, they die." The idea, however, appears to be, both good and evil go to the same place, pass away into nothingness, are known no more in this world. Here at present Koheleth leaves the question of the future life, having already intimated his belief in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. and Ecclesiastes 8:11, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-3 We are not to think our searching into the word or works of God useless, because we cannot explain all difficulties. We may learn many things good for ourselves and useful to others. But man cannot always decide who are objects of God's special love, or under his wrath; and God will certainly put a difference between the precious and the vile, in the other world. The difference as to present happiness, arises from the inward supports and consolations the righteous enjoy, and the benefit they derive from varied trials and mercies. As far as the sons of men are left to themselves, their hearts are full of evil; and prosperity in sin, causes them even to set God at defiance by daring wickedness. Though, on this side death, the righteous and the wicked may often seem to fare alike, on the other side there will be a vast difference between them.</body></html>
