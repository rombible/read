The experience which follows he recognized as an instance of worldly wisdom. To what special event he alludes is quite unknown. Probably the circumstance was familiar to his contemporaries. It is not to be considered as an allegory, though of course it is capable of spiritual application. The event in Bible history most like it is the preservation of Abel-Beth-maachah by the counsel of the wise woman (whose name is forgotten) narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15-22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And it seemed great unto me</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>, "And it is great before me." To my mind it appeared an important example (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>). Some critics who contend for the Solomonic authorship of our book, see here an allegorical reference to the foreseen revolt of Jeroboam, whose insurrection had been opposed by certain wise statesmen, but had been carried out in opposition to their counsel. Wordsworth considers that the apologue may be illustrated by the history of Jerusalem, when great powers were arrayed against it in the time of Isaiah, and the prophet by his prayers and exhortations delivered it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-2.htm">2 Kings 19:2, 6, 20</a>), but was wholly disregarded afterwards, nay, was put to death by the son of the king whom he saved. But all this is <span class="accented">nihil ad rem</span>. As Plautus says, "Haec quidem deliramenta loquitur." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-18 A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which he could never do by his strength. If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.</body></html>
