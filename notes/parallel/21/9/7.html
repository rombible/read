The inscrutability of the moral government of the world, the uncertainty of life, the condition of the dead, lead to the conclusion again that one should use one's life to the best advantage; and Koheleth repeats his caution concerning the issues and duration of life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy</span>. This is not an injunction to lead a selfish life of Epicurean pleasure; but taking the limited view to which he here confines himself, the Preacher inculcates the practical wisdom of looking at the bright side of things; he says in effect (though he takes care afterwards to correct a wrong impression which might be given)," Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>). We have had the same counsel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Drink thy wine with a merry heart</span>. Wine was not an accompaniment of meals usually; it -was reserved for feasts and solemn occasions. Bread and wine are here regarded as the necessary means of support and comfort (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>, etc.). The moderate use of wine is nowhere forbidden; there is no law in the Old Testament against the use of intoxicating drinks; the employment of such fluids as cordials, exhilarating, strengthening and comforting, is often referred to (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6, 7</a>; Ecclus. 31:27, 28). Thus Koheleth's advice, taken even literally, is not contrary to the spirit of his religion. <span class="cmt_word">For God now</span> (<span class="accented">long ago</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>accepteth thy works</span>. The "works" are not moral or religious doings, in reward of which God gives temporal blessings, which is plainly opposed to Koheleth's chief contention in all this passage. The works are the eating and drinking just mentioned. By the constitution of man's nature, and by the ordering of Providence, such capacity of enjoyment is allowable, and there need be no scruple in using it. Such things are God's good gifts, and to be received with reverence and thanksgiving; and he who thus employs them is well-pleasing unto the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-10 The most despicable living man's state, is preferable to that of the most noble who have died impenitent. Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do.
