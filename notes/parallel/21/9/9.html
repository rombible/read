literally, see <span class="accented">life with a wife whom thou lovest</span>. The article is omitted, as the maxim is to be taken generally. In correction of the outspoken condemnation of women in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>, Koheleth here recognizes the happiness of a home where is found a helpmate beloved and worthy of love (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>, on which our passage seems to be founded; and Ecclus. 26:13-18). (For the expression, " see life," <span class="accented">vide</span> note on Ecclesiastes 2:1.) St. Jerome's comment is misleading, "Quacumque tibi placuerit feminarum ejus gaude complexu." Some critics translate <span class="accented">ishshah</span> here "woman." Thus Cox: "Enjoy thyself with any woman whom thou lovest;" but the best commentators agree that the married state is meant in the text, not mere sensual enjoyment. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of the life of thy vanity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> throughout the time of thy quickly passing life. This is repeated after the next clause (though there omitted by the Septuagint and Syriac), in order to emphasize the transitoriness of the present and the consequent wisdom of enjoying it while it lasts. So Horace bids man "carpe diem" ('Carm.,' 1:11.8), "enjoy each atom of the day;'" and Martial sings ('Epigr,' 7:47. 11) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Vive velut rapto fugitivaque gaudia carpe."</span><br /><span class="accented">"Live thou thy life as stolen, and enjoy<br />Thy quickly fading pleasures."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Which he</span> (<span class="accented">God</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hath given thee under the sun</span>. The relative may refer to either the "wife" or" the days of life." The Septuagint and Vulgate take it as belonging to the latter, and this seems most suitable (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor</span>, etc. Such moderate enjoyment is the recompense allowed by God for the toil which accompanies a properly spent life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-10 The most despicable living man's state, is preferable to that of the most noble who have died impenitent. Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.</body></html>
