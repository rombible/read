The Preacher brings into prominence certain particulars of enjoyment, more noticeable than mere eating and drinking. White garments in the East (as among ourselves) were symbols of joy and purity. Thus the singers in Solomon's temple were arrayed in white linen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>). Mordecai was thus honored by King Ahasuerus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>), the angels are seen similarly decked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>), and the glorified saints are clothed in white (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5, 18</a>). So in the pseudepi-graphal books the same imagery is retained. Those that "have fulfilled the Law of the Lord have received glorious garments, and are clothed in white" (2 Esdr. 2:39, 40). Among the Romans the same symbolism obtained. Horace ('Sat.,' 2:2. 60) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ille repotia, natales aliosve dierum<br />Festes albatus celebret."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Though he in whitened toga celebrate<br />His wedding, birthday, or high festival."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Let thy head lack no ointment</span>. Oil and perfumes were used on festive occasions not only among Eastern nations, but by Greeks and Romans (see on Ecclesiastes 7:1). Thus Telemachus is anointed with fragrant oil by the fair Polykaste (Homer, 'Od,' 3:466). Sappho complains to Phaen (Ovid,' Heroid.' 15:76) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Non Arabs noster rore capillus olet."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No myrrh of Araby bedews my hair."</span> Such allusions in Horace are frequent and commonly cited (see 'Carm.,' 1:5. 2; 2:7. 7, 8; 2:11. 15, etc.). Thus the double injunction in this verse counsels one to be always happy and cheerful. Gregory Thaumaturgus (cited by Plumptre) represents the passage as the error of "men of vanity;" and other commentators have deemed that it conveyed not the Preacher's own sentiments, but those of an atheist whom he cites. There is, as we have already seen, no need to resort to such an explanation. Doubtless the advice may readily be perverted to evil, and made to sanction sensuality and licentiousness, as-we see to have been done in Wisd. 2:6-9; but Koheleth only urges the moderate use of earthly goods as consecrated by God's gift. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-10 The most despicable living man's state, is preferable to that of the most noble who have died impenitent. Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.</body></html>
