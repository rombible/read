Here follow <span class="accented">some proverbial sayings concerning wisdom and its opposite</span>, which draw the moral from the story in the text. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools</span>. This verse would be better translated, Wo<span class="accented">rds of the wise in quiet are heard better than the shout of a chief among fools</span>. The Vulgate takes the tranquility to appertain to the hearers, thus: <span class="accented">Verbs sapientium audiuntur in silentio</span>; but, as Delitzsch points out, the contrast between "quiet" and "cry" shows that it is the man, and not his auditors, who is quiet. The sentence says that a wise man's words, uttered calmly, deliberately, without pompous declamation or adventitious aids, are of more value than the blustering vociferation of an arch-fool, who seeks to force acceptance for his folly by loudness and swagger (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>; and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-2.htm">Isaiah 42:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-19.htm">Matthew 12:19</a>, passages which speak of the peacefulness, reticence, and unobtrusiveness of true wisdom, as seen in the Son of God). The verse introduces a kind of exception to the general rejection of wisdom mentioned above. Though the multitude turn a deaf ear to a wise man's counsel, yet this tells in the long run, and there are always some teachable persons-who sit at his feet and learn from him. "He that ruleth among fools" is not one that governs a silly people, but one who is a prince of fools, who takes the highest place among such. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-18 A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which he could never do by his strength. If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.</body></html>
