What is here told is so like the story (2 Samuel 20) of the deliverance of Abel-beth-Maachah by a wise woman, whose name, nevertheless, has not been preserved, that we cannot even be sure that the writer had any other real history in his mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was a little city</span>. The substantive verb is, as commonly, omitted. Commentators have amused themselves with endeavoring to identify the city here mentioned. Thus some see herein Athens, saved by the counsel of Themistocles, who was afterwards driven from Athens and died in misery (Justin., 2:12); or Dora, near Mount Carmel, besieged unsuccessfully by Antiochus the Great, <span class="date">B.C. 218</span>, though we know nothing of the circumstances (Polyb., 5:66); but see note on ver. 13. The Septuagint takes the whole paragraph hypothetically, "Suppose there was a little city," etc. Wright well compares the historical allusions to events fresh in the minds of his hearers made by our Lord in his parable of the pounds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm">Luke 19:12, 14, 15, 27</a>). So we may regard the present section as a parable founded on some historical fact well known at the time when the book was written. <span class="cmt_word">A great king</span>. The term points to some Persian or Assyrian potentate; or it may mean merely a powerful general (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-25.htm">Job 29:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Built great bulwarks against it</span>. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "great palisades;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Extruxitque munitiones per gyrum</span>. What are meant are embankments or mounds raised high enough to overtop the walls of the town, and to command the positions of the besieged. For the same purpose wooden towers were also used (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a>; Jeremiah lit. 4). The Vulgate rounds off the account in the text by adding, <span class="accented">et perfects est obsidio</span>, " and the beleaguering was completed." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-18 A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which he could never do by his strength. If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.</body></html>
