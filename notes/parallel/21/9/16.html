The latter part of the verse is not a correction of the former, but the whole comes under the observation introduced by "I said." The story just related leads to this assertion, which reproduces the gnome of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>, wherein it is asserted that wisdom effects more than mere physical strength. There is an interpolation in the Old Latin Version of Wisd. 6. I which seems to have been compiled from this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-13.htm">Proverbs 16:13</a>, "Melter est sapientia quam vires, et vir prudens quam fortis." <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised,</span> etc. In the instance above mentioned the poor man's wisdom was not despised and his words were heard and attended to; but this was an abnormal case, occasioned by the extremity of the peril. Koheleth states the result which usually attends wisdom emanating from a disesteemed source. The experience of Ben-Sire pointed to the same issue (see Ecclus. 13:22, 23). Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:1.57 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque,<br />Sed quadringentis sex septem millia desunt;<br />Plebs erie."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"In wit, worth, honor, one in vain abounds;<br />If of the knight's estate he lack ten pounds,<br />He's low, quite low!"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) Is not this the carpenter's Son? asked the people who were offended at Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2, 3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-18 A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which he could never do by his strength. If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.</body></html>
