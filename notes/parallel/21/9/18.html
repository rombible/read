Such is the moral which Koheleth desires to draw from the little narrative given above (see vers. 14-16; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>). Wisdom can do what no material force can effect, and often produces results which all the implements of war could not command. <span class="cmt_word">But one sinner destroyeth much good.</span> The happy consequences which the wise man's counsel might accomplish, or has already accomplished, may be overthrown or rendered useless by the villany or perversity of a bad man. The Vulgate, reading differently, has, <span class="accented">Qui in uno peccaverit, multa bona perdet</span>. But this seems to be out of keeping with the context. Adam's sin infected the whole race of man; Achau's transgression caused Israel's defeat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11, 12</a>); Rehoboam's folly occasioned the great schism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>). The wide&deg; reaching effects of one little error are illustrated by the proverbial saying which every one knows, and which runs in Latin thus: "Clavus unus perdit equi soleam, soles equum, equus equitem, eques castra, castro rempublicam." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-18 A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which he could never do by his strength. If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.</body></html>
