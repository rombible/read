literally, <span class="accented">all things</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">like that which</span> [<span class="accented">happens</span>] <span class="accented">to all persons</span>. There is no difference in the treatment of persons; all people of every kind meet with circumstances of every kind. Speaking generally, there is no discrimination, apparently, in the distribution of good and evil. Sun and shade, calm and storm. fruitful and unfruitful seasons, joy and sorrow, are dispensed by inscrutable laws. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "Vanity is in all;" the Syriac unites two readings, "All before him is vanity, all as to all" (Ginsburg). <span class="cmt_word">There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked.</span> All men have the same lot, whether it be death or any other contingency, without regard to their naomi condition. The classes into which men are divided must be noted. "Righteous" and <span class="accented">"wicked"</span> refer to men in their conduct to others. <span class="cmt_word">The good.</span> The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac add, "to the evil," which is said again almost immediately. <span class="cmt_word">To the clean, and to the unclean</span>. "The good" and "clean" are those who are not only ceremonially pure, but, as the epithet "good" shows, are morally undefiled. <span class="cmt_word">To him that sacrificeth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man who attends to the externals of religion, offers the obligatory sacrifices, and brings his free-will offerings. <span class="cmt_word">The good... the sinner</span>; in the widest senses. <span class="cmt_word">He that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath</span>. He who takes an oath lightly, carelessly, or falsely (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>), is contrasted with him who regards it as a holy thing, or shrinks in awe from invoking God's Name in such a case This last idea is regarded as a late Essenic development (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 6); though something like it is found in the sermon on the mount, "I say unto you, Swear not at all," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34-37</a>). Dean Plumptre, however, throws doubt on the above interpretation, owing to the fact that in all the other groups the good side is placed first; and he suggests that "he who sweareth" may be one who does his duty in this particular religiously and well (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>), and "he who fears the oath" is a man whose conscience makes him shrink from the oath of compurgation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19-22</a>), or who is too cowardly to give his testimony in due form. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ut perjurus, its et ille qui verum dejerat</span>; and it seems unnecessary to present an entirely new view of the passage in slavish expectation of a concinnity which the author cannot be proved to have ever aimed at. The five contrasted pairs are the righteous and the wicked, the clean and the unclean, the sacrificer and the non-sacrificer, the good and the sinner, the profane swearer and the man who reverences an oath. The last clause is rendered by the Septuagint, "So is he who sweareth (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) even as he who fears the oath," which is as ambiguous as the original. A cautious Greek gnome says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Avoid an oath, though justly you might swear."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-3 We are not to think our searching into the word or works of God useless, because we cannot explain all difficulties. We may learn many things good for ourselves and useful to others. But man cannot always decide who are objects of God's special love, or under his wrath; and God will certainly put a difference between the precious and the vile, in the other world. The difference as to present happiness, arises from the inward supports and consolations the righteous enjoy, and the benefit they derive from varied trials and mercies. As far as the sons of men are left to themselves, their hearts are full of evil; and prosperity in sin, causes them even to set God at defiance by daring wickedness. Though, on this side death, the righteous and the wicked may often seem to fare alike, on the other side there will be a vast difference between them.</body></html>
