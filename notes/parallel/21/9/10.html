In accordance with what has been already said, and to combat the idea that, as man cannot control his fate, he should take no pains to work his work, but fold his hands in resigned inaction, Koheleth urges him not to despair, but to do his part manfully as long as life is given, and with all the energies of his soul carry out the purpose of his being. The Septuagint gives, <span class="accented">"All</span> things whatsoever thy hand shall find to do, do it as thy power is (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quodcumque facere potest manus tua, instanter operate</span>. The expression at the commencement may be illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-28.htm">Leviticus 25:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-33.htm">Judges 9:33</a>, where it implies ability to carry out some intention, and in some passages is thus rendered, "is able," etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>). It is therefore erroneous to render it in this place, "Whatever by chance cometh to hand;" <span class="accented">or</span> "Let might be right." Rather it is a call to work as the prelude and accompaniment of enjoyment, anticipating St. Paul's maxim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>), <span class="accented">"If</span> any would not work, neither should he eat." Ginsburg's interpretation is dishonoring to the Preacher and foreign to his real sentiments, "Have recourse to every source of voluptuous gratification, while thou art in thy <span class="accented">strength</span>." The true meaning of the verse is confirmed by such references as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, <span class="accented">"I</span> must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>, "Now is the accepted time; now is the day of salvation;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>, "As we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men." <span class="cmt_word">For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave.</span> The departed have no more work which they can do, no plans or calculations to make; their knowledge is strictly limited, their wisdom is ended. It needs body and soul to carry on the labors and activities of this world; when these are severed, and can no longer act together, there is a complete alteration in the man's relations and capacities. <span class="accented">"The</span> grave," <span class="accented">sheol</span> (which is found nowhere else in <span class="accented">Ecclesiastes</span>)<span class="accented">, is</span> the place to which go the souls of the dead - a shadowy region. <span class="cmt_word">Whither thou goest; to which all are bound</span>. It is plain that the writer believes in the continued existence of the soul, as he differentiates its life in <span class="accented">sheol</span> from its life on earth, the energies and operations which are carried on in the one case being curtailed or eclipsed in the other. Of any repentance, or purification, or progress, in the unseen world, Koheleth knows and says nothing. He would seem to regard existence there as a sleep or a state of insensibility; at any rate, such is the natural view of the present passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-10 The most despicable living man's state, is preferable to that of the most noble who have died impenitent. Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.</body></html>
