Our translators, following the older translators, adopt the reading of the margin. That of the text gives, instead of "joined," a word signifying "chosen;" the best sense that can be given to which is to translate, "For who is excepted," joining it with the previous verse, beginning this one, "To all the living," &c. With regard to the statement of the following verses, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-3.htm" title="My soul is also sore vexed: but you, O LORD, how long?">Psalm 6:3</a> and the marginal references there given. The shepherd's dog is spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm" title="But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.">Job 30:1</a>, and watchdogs <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-10.htm" title="His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.">Isaiah 56:10</a>. Elsewhere in the Old Testament the dog is an unclean animal living or dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope</span>. As long as a man lives (is one of living beings) he has some hope, whatever it be. This feeling is inextinguishable even unto the end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Hope springs eternal in the human breast."</span> Thus Bailey sings, in 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"All Have hopes, however wretched they may be,<br />Or blessed. It is hope which lifts the lark so high,<br />Hope of a lighter air and bluer sky</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">And the poor hack which drops down on the flints,<br />Upon whose eye the dust is settling, he<br />Hopes, but to die. No being exists, of hope,<br />Of love, void."</span> This clause gives a reason for the folly of men, mentioned in ver. 3. Whatever be their lot, or their way of life, they see no reason to make any change by reformation or active exertion. They go on hoping, and do nothing. Something may turn up; amid the inexplicable confusion of the ordering of events some happy contingency may arrive. The above is the reading according to the Keri. Thus the Septuagint: <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>; "For who is he that has fellowship with all the living?" Symmachus has, "For who is he that will always continue to live?" while the Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Nemo</span> <span class="accented">est qui semper vivat</span>. The Khetib points differently, offering the reading, "For who is excepted?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the common lot, the interrogation being closely connected with the preceding verse, or "Who can choose?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he will die or not. The sentence then proceeds, "To all the living there is hope." But the rendering of the Authorized Version has good authority, and affords the better sense. <span class="cmt_word">For a living dog is better than a dead lion</span>. The dog in Palestine was not made a pet and companion, as it is among us, but was regarded as a loathsome and despicable object comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-8.htm">2 Samuel 3:8</a>); while the lion was considered as the noblest of beasts, the type of power and greatness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>). So the proverbial saying in the text means that the vilest and meanest creature possessed of life is better than the highest and mightiest which has succumbed to death. There is an apparent contradiction between this sentence and such passages as claim a preference for death over life, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; but in the latter the writer is viewing life with all its sorrows and bitter experiences, here he regards it as affording the possibility of enjoyment. In the one case he holds death as desirable, because it delivers from further sorrow and puts an end to misery; in the other, he deprecates death as cutting off from pleasure and hope. He may also have in mind that now is the time to do the work which we have to perform: "The night cometh when no man can work;" Ecclus. 17:28, "Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not; the living and sound shall praise the Lord" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-10 The most despicable living man's state, is preferable to that of the most noble who have died impenitent. Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.</body></html>
