Everything is meaningless.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/ecclesiastes/3.htm">New Living Translation</a></span><br />For people and animals share the same fate--both breathe and both must die. So people have no real advantage over the animals.

The conclusion in ver. 22 is connected with vers. 16-18. We must acknowledge that there are disorders in the world which we cannot remedy, and which God allows in order to demonstrate our powerlessness; therefore the wisest course is to make the best of present cir-circumstances. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts</span>; literally, <span class="accented">chance are the sons of men</span>, <span class="accented">and chance are beasts</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 2:14); Septuagint, "<span class="accented">Yea</span>, and to them cometh the event (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the <span class="accented">sons</span> of men, and the event of the <span class="accented">beast</span>." Koheleth explains in what respect man is on a level with the brute creation. Neither are able to rise superior to the law that controls their natural life. So Solon <span class="accented">says</span> to Croesus (Herod., 1:32), <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;</span>, "Man is naught but chance;" and Artabanns reminds Xerxes that chances rule men, not men chances (ibid., 7:49). <span class="cmt_word">Even one thing befalleth them</span>. A third time is the ominous word repeated, "One chance is to both of them." Free-thinkers perverted this dictum into the materialistic language quoted in the Book of Wisdom (2. 2): "We are born at haphazard, by chance (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x1ffd;</span>); etc. But Koheleth's contention is, not that there is no law or order in what happens to man, but that neither man nor beast can dispose events at their own will and pleasure; they are conditioned by a force superior to them, which dominates their actions, sufferings, and circumstances of life. <span class="cmt_word">As the one dieth, so dieth the other</span>. In the matter of succumbing to the law of death man has no superiority over other creatures. This is an inference drawn from common observation of exterior facts, and touches not any higher question (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2, 3</a>). Something similar is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>, "<span class="accented">Man</span> that is in honor, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have all one breath</span> (<span class="accented">ruach</span>). This is the word used in ver. 23 for the vital principle, "the breath of life," as it is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a>, where the same word is found. In the earlier record (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) the term is <span class="accented">nishma</span>. Life in all animals is regarded as the gift of God. Says the psalmist, "Thou sendest forth thy spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>), they are created" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>). This lower principle presents the same phenomena in men and in brutes. <span class="cmt_word">Man hath no pre-eminence above a beast</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in regard to suffering and death. This is not bare materialism, or a gloomy deduction from Greek teaching, but must be explained from the writer's standpoint, which is to emphasize the impotence of man to effect his own happiness. Taking only a limited and phenomenal view of man's circumstances and destiny, he speaks a general truth which all must acknowledge. Septuagint, "And what hath the man more than the beast? Nothing." <span class="cmt_word">For all is vanity</span>. The distinction between man and beast is annulled by death; the former's boasted superiority, his power of conceiving and planning, his greatness, skill, strength. cunning, all come under the category of vanity, as they cannot ward off the inevitable blow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-22 Without the fear of the Lord, man is but vanity; set that aside, and judges will not use their power well. And there is another Judge that stands before the door. With God there is a time for the redressing of grievances, though as yet we see it not. Solomon seems to express his wish that men might perceive, that by choosing this world as their portion, they brought themselves to a level with the beasts, without being free, as they are, from present vexations and a future account. Both return to the dust from whence they were taken. What little reason have we to be proud of our bodies, or bodily accomplishments! But as none can fully comprehend, so few consider properly, the difference between the rational soul of man, and the spirit or life of the beast. The spirit of man goes upward, to be judged, and is then fixed in an unchangeable state of happiness or misery. It is as certain that the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth; it perishes at death. Surely their case is lamentable, the height of whose hopes and wishes is, that they may die like beasts. Let our inquiry be, how an eternity of existence may be to us an eternity of enjoyment? To answer this, is the grand design of revelation. Jesus is revealed as the Son of God, and the Hope of sinners.</body></html>
