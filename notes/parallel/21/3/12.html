When enjoyment is meant, the phrase used is, as in the next verse, "to see good;" but the context seems to require that this sense should be given to the phrase in this verse also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I knew</span>, <span class="accented">perceived</span>, <span class="accented">that there was no good for them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for men. From the facts adduced, Koheleth learned this practical result - that man had nothing in his own power (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24) which would conduce to his happiness, but to make the best of life such as he finds it. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Cognovi quod non esset melius nisi laetari</span>. <span class="cmt_word">To do good in his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Facere bene</span> (Vulgate). This has been taken by many in the sense of "doing one's self good, prospering, enjoying one's self." like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and therefore nearly equivalent to "rejoice" in the former part of the verse. But the expression is best taken here, as when it occurs elsewhere (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>), in a moral sense, and it thus teaches the great truth that virtue is essential to happiness, that to "trust in the Lord... to depart from evil, and to do good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-3.htm">Psalm 36:3</a>, 27), will bring peace and content (see in the epilogue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</a>). There is no Epicureanism in this verse; the enjoyment spoken of is not licentiousness, but a happy appreciation of the innocent pleasures which the love of God offers to those who live in accordance with the laws of their higher nature. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-15 Every thing is as God made it; not as it appears to us. We have the world so much in our hearts, are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things, that we have neither time nor spirit to see God's hand in them. The world has not only gained possession of the heart, but has formed thoughts against the beauty of God's works. We mistake if we think we were born for ourselves; no, it is our business to do good in this life, which is short and uncertain; we have but little time to be doing good, therefore we should redeem time. Satisfaction with Divine Providence, is having faith that all things work together for good to them that love him. God doeth all, that men should fear before him. The world, as it has been, is, and will be. There has no change befallen us, nor has any temptation by it taken us, but such as is common to men.</body></html>
