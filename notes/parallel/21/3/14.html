We cannot hasten or retard God's designs; we cannot add to or curtail his plans. Septuagint, "It is impossible to add (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) to it, and it is impossible to Lake away from it." Thus Ecclus. 18:6, "As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is impossible to lessen or to add to them (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), neither can the ground of them be found out." <span class="cmt_word">God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</span> There is a moral purpose in this disposal of events. Men feel this uniformity and unchangeableness in the working of Providence, and thence learn to cherish a reverential awe for the righteous government of which they are the subjects. It was this feeling which led ancient etymologists to derive <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="accented">Deus</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "fear" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3, 4</a>). This is also a ground of hope and confidence. Amid the jarring and fluctuating circumstances of men God holds the threads, and alters not his purpose. "I the Lord change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). The Vulgate is not very successful: <span class="accented">Non</span> <span class="accented">possumus eis quid-quam addere</span>, <span class="accented">nec auferre</span>, <span class="accented">quae fecit Deus ut timeatur</span>, "We cannot add anything unto, or take anything away from, those things which God hath made that he may be feared." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-15 Every thing is as God made it; not as it appears to us. We have the world so much in our hearts, are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things, that we have neither time nor spirit to see God's hand in them. The world has not only gained possession of the heart, but has formed thoughts against the beauty of God's works. We mistake if we think we were born for ourselves; no, it is our business to do good in this life, which is short and uncertain; we have but little time to be doing good, therefore we should redeem time. Satisfaction with Divine Providence, is having faith that all things work together for good to them that love him. God doeth all, that men should fear before him. The world, as it has been, is, and will be. There has no change befallen us, nor has any temptation by it taken us, but such as is common to men.</body></html>
