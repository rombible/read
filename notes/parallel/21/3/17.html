In view of the injustice that prevails in earthly tribunals, Koheleth takes comfort in the thought that there is retribution in store for every man. when God shall award sentence according to deserts. God is a righteous Judge strong and patient, and his decisions are infallible. Future judgment is here plainly stated, as it is at the final conclusion (Ecclesiastes 11:14). They who refuse to credit the writer with belief in this great doctrine resort to the theory of interpolation and alteration in order to account for the language in this and analogous <span class="accented">passages</span>. There can be no doubt that the present text has hitherto always been regarded as genuine, and that it does clearly assert future retribution, though not so much as a conclusion firmly established, but rather as a belief which may explain anomalies and afford comfort under trying <span class="accented">circumstances</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</span> The adverb rendered "there" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sham) is placed emphatically, at the end of the sentence. Thus the Septuagint, "There is a reason for every action, and for every work there (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>)." Many take it to mean" in the other world," and Plumptre cites Eurip., 'Med.,' 1073 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"All good be with you! but it must be there;<br />Here it is stolen from you by your sire."</span> But it is unexampled to find the elliptical "there," when no place has been mentioned in the context, and when we are precluded from interpreting the dark word by a significant gesture, as Medea may have pointed downwards in her histrionic despair. Where the words, "that day," are used in the New Testament (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-18.htm">2 Timothy 1:18</a>, etc.), the context shows plainly to what they refer. Some take the adverb here in the sense of "then." Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justum et impium iudicabit Deus</span>, <span class="accented">et tempus omnis rei tunc erit</span>." But really no time has been mentioned, unless we conceive the writer to have been guilty of a clumsy tautology, expressing by "then" the same idea as "<span class="accented">a</span> time for every <span class="accented">purpose</span>," etc. Ewald would understand it of the past; but this is quite arbitrary, and limits the signification of the sentence unnecessarily. It is best, with many modern commentators, to refer the adverb to God, who has just been spoken of in the preceding clause. A similar use is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>. With God, <span class="accented">spud Deum</span>, in his counsels, there is a time or judgment and retribution for every act of man, when anomalies which have obtained on earth shall be rectified, injustice shall be punished, virtue rewarded. There is no need, with some commentators, to read up, "he appointed;" the usual reading gives a satisfactory sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-22 Without the fear of the Lord, man is but vanity; set that aside, and judges will not use their power well. And there is another Judge that stands before the door. With God there is a time for the redressing of grievances, though as yet we see it not. Solomon seems to express his wish that men might perceive, that by choosing this world as their portion, they brought themselves to a level with the beasts, without being free, as they are, from present vexations and a future account. Both return to the dust from whence they were taken. What little reason have we to be proud of our bodies, or bodily accomplishments! But as none can fully comprehend, so few consider properly, the difference between the rational soul of man, and the spirit or life of the beast. The spirit of man goes upward, to be judged, and is then fixed in an unchangeable state of happiness or misery. It is as certain that the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth; it perishes at death. Surely their case is lamentable, the height of whose hopes and wishes is, that they may die like beasts. Let our inquiry be, how an eternity of existence may be to us an eternity of enjoyment? To answer this, is the grand design of revelation. Jesus is revealed as the Son of God, and the Hope of sinners.</body></html>
