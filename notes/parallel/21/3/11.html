And if we adopt the rendering "world," it is difficult to explain the verse so as to connect it with the context. Where the word occurs elsewhere it means "eternity," or "long duration," and is so used in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm" title="One generation passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth stays for ever.">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm" title="Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it has been already of old time, which was before us.">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm" title="For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dies the wise man? as the fool.">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-14.htm" title="I know that, whatever God does, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God does it, that men should fear before him.">Ecclesiastes 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-6.htm" title="Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>). Taking this meaning of the word here (the only place where the word is used with the article), we may regard it as contrasted with that for "time," or season, immediately before. Life exhibits a changing succession of weeping alternating with laughing, war with peace, and so forth. For each of these God has appointed its time or season, and in its season each is good. But man does not recognise this; for God has put in his heart an expectation and longing for abiding continuance of the same, and so he fails to understand the work which God does in the world.<p><span class= "bld">So that no.</span>--The connecting phrase here employed is rendered "because none" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm" title="Lest the land from where you brought us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-3.htm" title="And one said, Be content, I pray you, and go with your servants.

A word belonging to the later Hebrew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath made every thing beautiful in his</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">time</span>. "Everything:" (<span class="accented">eth hacol</span>) does not refer so much to the original creation which God made very good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>), as to the travail and business mentioned in ver. 10. All parts of this have, in God's design, a beauty and a harmony, their own season for appearance and development, their work to do in carrying on the majestic march of Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Also</span> <span class="cmt_word">he hath set the world in their heart.</span> "The world;" <span class="accented">eth-haolam</span>, placed (as <span class="accented">haeol</span> above) before the verb, with <span class="accented">eth</span>, to emphasize the relation. There is some uncertainty in the translation of this word. The LXX. <span class="accented">has</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Mundum tradidit disputationi eorum</span>. The original meaning is "the hidden," and it is used generally in the Old Testament of the remote past, and sometimes of the future, as Daniel 3:33 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Daniel 4:3<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>, so that the idea conveyed is of unknown duration, whether the glance looks backward or forward, which is equivalent to our word "eternity." It is only in later Hebrew that the word obtained the signification of "age" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), or "world" in its relation to time. Commentators who have adopted the latter sense here explain the expression as if it meant that man in himself is a microcosm, a little world, or that the love of the world, the love of life, is naturally implanted in him. But taking the term in the signification found throughout the Bible, we are justified in translating it "eternity." The pronoun in "their heart" refers to "the sons of men" in the previous verse. God has put into men's minds a notion of infinity of duration; the beginning and the end of things are alike beyond his grasp; the time to be born and the time to die are equally unknown and uncontrollable. Koheleth is not thinking of that hope of immortality which his words unfold to us with our better knowledge; he is speculating on the innate faculty of looking backward and forward which man possesses, but which is insufficient to solve the problems which present themselves every day. This conception of eternity may be the foundation of great hopes and expectations, but as an explanation of the ways of Providence it fails. <span class="cmt_word">So that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end</span>; or, <span class="accented">without man being able to penetrate</span>; <span class="accented">yet so that he cannot</span>, etc. Man sees only minute parts of the great whole; he cannot comprehend all at one view, cannot understand the law that regulates the time and season of every circumstance in the history of man and the world. He feels that, as there has been an infinite past, there will be an infinite future, which may solve anomalies and demonstrate the harmonious unity of God's design, and he must be content to wait and hope. Comparison of the past with the present may help to adumbrate the future, but is inadequate to unravel the complicated thread of the world's history (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16, 17</a>, and Ecclesiastes 9:1, where a similar thought is expressed). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-15 Every thing is as God made it; not as it appears to us. We have the world so much in our hearts, are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things, that we have neither time nor spirit to see God's hand in them. The world has not only gained possession of the heart, but has formed thoughts against the beauty of God's works. We mistake if we think we were born for ourselves; no, it is our business to do good in this life, which is short and uncertain; we have but little time to be doing good, therefore we should redeem time. Satisfaction with Divine Providence, is having faith that all things work together for good to them that love him. God doeth all, that men should fear before him. The world, as it has been, is, and will be. There has no change befallen us, nor has any temptation by it taken us, but such as is common to men.</body></html>
