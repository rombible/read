rather, <span class="accented">it happens on account of the sons of men</span>. <span class="accented">God</span> allows events to take place, disorders to continue, etc., for the ultimate profit of men, though the idea that follows is humiliating and dispiriting. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, "<span class="accented">concerning</span> the speech of the sons of men." So the Syriac. The word <span class="accented">dibrah</span> may indeed bear that meaning, as it is also used for "<span class="accented">word"</span> or "<span class="accented">matter</span>;" but we cannot conceive that the clause refers solely to words, and the expression in the text signifies merely "<span class="accented">for</span> the sake, on account of," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That God might manifest them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that God might test them</span>; <span class="accented">Ut probaret eos Dens</span> (Vulgate). God allows these things, endures them patiently, and does not at once redress them, for two reasons. The first of these is that they may serve for the probation of men, giving them opportunity of making good or bad use of them. We see the effect of this forbearance on the wicked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; it hardens them in impenitence; while it nourishes the faith of the righteous, and helps them to persevere (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</span> The pronoun is repeated emphatically, "that they themselves are [like] beasts, they in themselves." This is the second reason. Thus they learn their own powerlessness, if they regard merely their own animal life; apart from their relation to God and hope of the future, they are no better than the lower creatures. Septuagint. "And to show (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) that they are beasts." So the Vulgate and Syriac. The Masoretic reading adopted in the Anglican Version seems best. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-22 Without the fear of the Lord, man is but vanity; set that aside, and judges will not use their power well. And there is another Judge that stands before the door. With God there is a time for the redressing of grievances, though as yet we see it not. Solomon seems to express his wish that men might perceive, that by choosing this world as their portion, they brought themselves to a level with the beasts, without being free, as they are, from present vexations and a future account. Both return to the dust from whence they were taken. What little reason have we to be proud of our bodies, or bodily accomplishments! But as none can fully comprehend, so few consider properly, the difference between the rational soul of man, and the spirit or life of the beast. The spirit of man goes upward, to be judged, and is then fixed in an unchangeable state of happiness or misery. It is as certain that the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth; it perishes at death. Surely their case is lamentable, the height of whose hopes and wishes is, that they may die like beasts. Let our inquiry be, how an eternity of existence may be to us an eternity of enjoyment? To answer this, is the grand design of revelation. Jesus is revealed as the Son of God, and the Hope of sinners.</body></html>
