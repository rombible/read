The words rendered, "a time to be born," might more naturally mean "<span class="accented">a</span> time to bear;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint; as the verb is in the infinitive active, which, in this particular verb, is not elsewhere found used in the passive sense, though other verbs are so used sometimes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>. In the first case the catalogue commences with the beginning of life; in the second, with the season of full maturity: "Those who at one time give life to others, at another have themselves to yield to the law of death" (Wright). The contrast points to the passive rendering. There is no question of untimely birth or suicide; in the common order of events birth and death have each their appointed season, which comes to pass without man's interference, being directed by a higher law. "It is appointed unto men once to die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Koheleth's teaching was perverted by sensualists, as we read in Wisd. 2:2, 3, 5. <span class="cmt_word">A time to plant.</span> After speaking of human life it is natural to turn to vegetable life, which runs in parallel lines with man's existence. Thus Job, having intimated the shortness of life and the certainty of death, proceeds to speak of the tree, contrasting its revivifying powers with the <span class="accented">hopelessness</span> of man's decay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And to pluck up that which is planted</span>. This last operation may refer to the transplanting of trees and shrubs, or to the gathering of the fruits of the earth in order to make room for new agricultural works. But having regard to the opposition in all the members of the series, we should rather consider the "plucking up" as equivalent to destroying, if we plant trees, a time comes when we cut them down, and this is their final cause. Some commentators see in this clause an allusion to the settling and uprooting of kingdoms and nations, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-9.htm">Jeremiah 18:9</a>. etc. but this could not have been the idea in Koheleth's mind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 To expect unchanging happiness in a changing world, must end in disappointment. To bring ourselves to our state in life, is our duty and wisdom in this world. God's whole plan for the government of the world will be found altogether wise, just, and good. Then let us seize the favourable opportunity for every good purpose and work. The time to die is fast approaching. Thus labour and sorrow fill the world. This is given us, that we may always have something to do; none were sent into the world to be idle.</body></html>
