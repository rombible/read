The writer has not been speaking of the bringing the past into judgment, but of the immutable order of the universe, which constantly repeats itself. But it would seem that the word suggesting the thought of seeking for the purpose of judgment leads on to the next topic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been is now</span>; so Septuagint; "That which hath been made, the same remaineth" (Vulgate); better, <span class="accented">that which hath been</span>, <span class="accented">long ago it is</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. was in existence long before. The thought is much the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>, only here it is adduced not to prove the vanity and endless sameness of circumstances, but the orderly and appointed succession of events under the controlling providence of God. <span class="cmt_word">That which is to be hath already been</span>. The future will be a reproduction of the past. The laws which regulate things change not; the moral government is exercised by him who "is, and was, and is to come" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), and therefore in effect history repeats itself; the same causes produce the same phenomena. <span class="cmt_word">God requireth that which is past</span>; literally, <span class="accented">God seeketh after that which hath been chased away</span>; Septuagint, "God will seek him who is pursued (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, "God reneweth that which is passed (<span class="accented">instaurat quod abiit</span>)." The meaning is - God brings back to view, recalls again into being, that which was past and had vanished out of sight and mind. The sentence is an explanation of the preceding clauses, and has nothing to do with the inquisition at the day of judgment. Hengstenberg has followed the Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum, in translating, "God seeks the persecuted," and seeing herein an allusion to the punishment of the Egyptians for pursuing the Israelites to the Red Sea, or a general statement that God succors the oppressed. But this idea is quite alien to the intention of the passage, and injures the coherence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-15 Every thing is as God made it; not as it appears to us. We have the world so much in our hearts, are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things, that we have neither time nor spirit to see God's hand in them. The world has not only gained possession of the heart, but has formed thoughts against the beauty of God's works. We mistake if we think we were born for ourselves; no, it is our business to do good in this life, which is short and uncertain; we have but little time to be doing good, therefore we should redeem time. Satisfaction with Divine Providence, is having faith that all things work together for good to them that love him. God doeth all, that men should fear before him. The world, as it has been, is, and will be. There has no change befallen us, nor has any temptation by it taken us, but such as is common to men.</body></html>
