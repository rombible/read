This is usually understood of the rending of garments in token of grief (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29, 34</a>, etc.), and the repairing of the rent then made when the season of mourning was ended. The Talmudists laid down careful rules concerning the extent of the ritual tear, and how long it was to remain unmended, both being regulated by the nearness of the relationship of the deceased person. In this interpretation there are these two difficulties: first, it makes the clause a virtual repetition of ver. 4; and secondly, it is not known for certain that the closing of the rent was a ceremonial custom in the times of Koheleth. Hence Plumptre inclines to take the expression metaphorically of the division of a kingdom by schism, and the restoration of unity, comparing the Prophet Ahijah's communication to Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30, 31</a>). But surely this would be a most unlikely allusion to put into Solomon's mouth; nor can we properly look for such a symbolical representation amid the other realistic examples given in the series. What Koheleth says is this - There are times when it is natural to tear clothes to pieces, whether from grief, or anger, or any other cause, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being old and worthless, or infected; and there are times when it is equally natural to mend them, and to make them serviceable by timely repairs. Connected with the notion of mourning contributed by this clause, though by no means confined to that notion, it is added, <span class="cmt_word">A time to keep silence, and a time to speak</span>. The silence of deep sorrow may be intimated, as when Job's friends sat by him in sympathizing silence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>), and the psalmist cried, "I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-2.htm">Psalm 39:2</a>); and Elisha could not bear to hear his master's departure mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5</a>). There are also occasions when the sorrow of the heart should find utterance, as in David's lament over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a>, etc.) and over Abner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-33.htm">2 Samuel 3:33</a>, etc.). But the gnome is of more general application. The young should hold their peace in the presence of their elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-4.htm">Job 32:4</a>, etc.); silence is often golden: "Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>). On the other hand, wise counsel is of infinite value, and must not be withheld at the right moment, and "a word in due season, how good is it!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>). "If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbor; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth" (Ecclus. 5:12; see more, Ecclus. 20:5, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 To expect unchanging happiness in a changing world, must end in disappointment. To bring ourselves to our state in life, is our duty and wisdom in this world. God's whole plan for the government of the world will be found altogether wise, just, and good. Then let us seize the favourable opportunity for every good purpose and work. The time to die is fast approaching. Thus labour and sorrow fill the world. This is given us, that we may always have something to do; none were sent into the world to be idle.</body></html>
