a time to mourn, and a time to dance;">Ecclesiastes 3:4</a>, it is thought that what is here referred to is the clearing or marring of land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm" title="And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the middle of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm" title="Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.">Isaiah 62:10</a>;

<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-25.htm" title="And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; however, the slingers went about it, and smote it.">2Kings 3:25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together.</span> There is no question about building or demolishing houses, as that has been already mentioned in ver. 3. Most commentators see an allusion to the practice of marring an enemy's fields by casting stones upon them, as the Israelites did when they invaded Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>). But this must have been a very abnormal proceeding, and could scarcely be cited as a usual occurrence. Nor is the notion more happy that there is an allusion to the custom of flinging stones or earth into the grave at a burial - a Christian, but not an ancient Jewish practice; this, too, leaves the contrasted "gathering" unexplained. Equally inappropriate is the opinion that the punishment of stoning is meant, or some game played with pebbles. It seems most simple to see herein intimated the operation of clearing a vineyard of stones, as mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; and of collecting materials for making fences, wine-press, tower, etc., and repairing roads. <span class="cmt_word">A time to embrace.</span> Those who explain the preceding clause of the marring and clearing of fields connect the following one with the other by conceiving that "the loving action of embracing stands beside the hostile, purposely injurious, throwing of stones into a field" (Delitzsch). It is plain that there are times when one may give himself up to the delights of love and friendship, and times when such distractions would be incongruous and unseasonable, as on solemn, penitential occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-16.htm">Joel 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>); but the congruity of the two clauses of the couplet is not obvious, unless the objectionable position of stones and their advantageous employment are compared with the character of illicit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>) and legitimate love. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 To expect unchanging happiness in a changing world, must end in disappointment. To bring ourselves to our state in life, is our duty and wisdom in this world. God's whole plan for the government of the world will be found altogether wise, just, and good. Then let us seize the favourable opportunity for every good purpose and work. The time to die is fast approaching. Thus labour and sorrow fill the world. This is given us, that we may always have something to do; none were sent into the world to be idle.</body></html>
