In confirmation of the truth that man's happiness depends upon the will of God, Koheleth proceeds to show how <span class="accented">Providence arranges even the minutest concerns</span>; <span class="accented">that man can alter nothing</span>, <span class="accented">must make the best of things as they are</span>, <span class="accented">bear with anomalies</span>, <span class="accented">bounding his desires by this present life</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - The providence of God disposes and arranges every detail of man's life. This proposition is stated first generally, and then worked out in particular by means of antithetical sentences. In Hebrew manuscripts and most printed texts vers. 2-8 are arranged in two parallel columns, so that one "time" always stands under another. A similar arrangement is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-9.htm">Joshua 12:9</a>, etc., containing the catalogue of the conquered Canaanite kings; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-7.htm">Esther 9:7</a>, etc., giving the names of Haman's tensions. In the present passage we have fourteen pairs of contrasts, ranging from external circumstances to the inner affections of man's being. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To every thing there is u season, and a time to every purpose under heaven</span>. . "Season" and "time" are rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The word for "season" (<span class="accented">zeman</span>), denotes a fixed, definite portion of time; while <span class="accented">eth</span>, "<span class="accented">time</span>," signifies rather the beginning of a period, or is used as a general appellation. The two ideas are sometimes concurrent in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1</a> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, where we find the singular <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in Theodotion, and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the Septuagint). So in Wisd. 8:8, "wisdom to foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="accented">Every thing</span> refers especially to men's movements and actions, and to what concerns them. <span class="accented">Purpose</span>; <span class="accented">chephets</span>, originally meaning "delight," "pleasure," in the later Hebrew came to signify "<span class="accented">business</span>," "thing," "<span class="accented">matter</span>." The proposition is - In human affairs Providence arranges the moment when everything shall happen, the duration of its operation, and the time appropriate thereto. The view of the writer takes in the whole circumstances of men's life from its commencement to its close. But the thought is not, as some have opined, that there is naught but uncertainty, fluctuation, and imperfection in human affairs, nor, as Plumptre conceives, "It is wisdom to do the right thing at the right time, that inopportuneness is the bane of life," for many of the circumstances mentioned, e.g. birth and death, are entirely beyond men's will and control, and the maxim, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>, cannot apply to man in such cases. Kobeleth is confirming his assertion, made in the last chapter, that wisdom, wealth, success, happiness, etc., are not in man's hands, that his own efforts can secure none of them - they are distributed at the will of God. He establishes this dictum by entering into details, and showing the ordering of Providence and the supremacy of God in all men's concerns, the most trivial as well as the most important. The Vulgate gives a paraphrase, and not a very exact one, <span class="accented">Omnia tempus habeat</span>, <span class="accented">et</span> suis <span class="accented">spatiis transenat universa sub caelo</span>. Koheleth intimates, without attempting to reconcile, the great <span class="accented">crux</span> of man's free-will and God's decree. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 To expect unchanging happiness in a changing world, must end in disappointment. To bring ourselves to our state in life, is our duty and wisdom in this world. God's whole plan for the government of the world will be found altogether wise, just, and good. Then let us seize the favourable opportunity for every good purpose and work. The time to die is fast approaching. Thus labour and sorrow fill the world. This is given us, that we may always have something to do; none were sent into the world to be idle.</body></html>
