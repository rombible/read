Plainly, the Divine prescience of vers. 10, 11 is closely connected with the question of man's ultimate good and his ignorance of the future, enunciated in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">For who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</span> Such discussions are profitless, for man knows not what is his real good - whether pleasure, apathy, or virtue, as philosophers would put it. To decide such questions he must be able to foresee results, which is denied him. The interrogative "Who knows?" is equivalent to an emphatic negative, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>, and is a common rhetorical form which surely need not be attributed to Pyrrhonism (Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow.</span> These words amplify and explain the term "in life" of the preceding clause. They may be rendered literally, <span class="accented">During the number of the days of the life</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>) <span class="accented">of his vanity</span>, <span class="accented">and he passeth them as a shadow</span>. A life of vanity is one that yields no good result, full of empty aims, unsatisfied wishes, unfulfilled purposes. It is the man who is here compared to the shadow, not his life. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, "He fleeth as a shadow, and continueth not," He soon passes away, and leaves no trace behind him. The thought is common. "Ye [Revised Version] are a vapor," says St. James (James 4:14), "that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away." Plumptre well quotes Soph., 'Ajax,' 125 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1ffe;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"In this I see that we, all we that live,<br />Are but vain shadows, unsubstantial dreams."</span> To which we may add Pind., 'Pyth.,' 8:95 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Ye creatures of a day!<br />What is the great man what the poor?<br />Naught but a shadowy dream."</span> The comparison of man's life to a shadow or vapor is equally general (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>; Wisd. 2:5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). The verb used for "spendeth" is <span class="accented">asah</span>, "to do or make," which recalls the Greek phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-33.htm">Acts 15:33</a>, etc.; Demosth., 'De Fals. Leg.,' p. 392, 17), and the Latin, <span class="accented">dies facere</span> (Cic., 'Ad Attic.,' 5:20. 1); but we need not trace Greek influence in the employment of the expression here. <span class="cmt_word">For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</span> This does not refer to the life beyond the grave, but to the future in the present world, as the words, "under the sun," imply (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>). To know what is best for him, to arrange his present life according to his own wishes and plans, to be able to depend upon his own counsel for all the actions and designs which he undertakes, man should know what is to be after him, what result his labors will have, who and what kind of heir will inherit his property, whether he will leave children to carry on his name, and other facts of the like nature; but as this is all hidden from him, his duty and his happiness is to acquiesce in the Divine government, to enjoy with moderation the goods of life, and to be content with the modified satisfaction which is accorded to him by Divine beneficence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:7-12 A little will serve to sustain us comfortably, and a great deal can do no more. The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.</body></html>
