but that the same man should have no sepulchre to preserve his name after him need not necessarily happen, so that one is tempted to think that the Preacher has some actual occurrence in his mind.<p><span class= "bld">Untimely birth.</span>--See references. We have just had another reminiscence of the Book of Job. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm" title="As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man beget an hundred children</span>. Another case is supposed, differing from,the preceding one, where the rich man dies childless. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. "Sons,' or "children," must be supplied (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>). To have a large family was regarded as a great blessing. The "hundred" is a round number, though we read of some fathers who had nearly this number of children; thus Ahab had seventy sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1</a>), Rehoboam eighty-eight children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>). Plumptre follows some commentators in seeing here an allusion to Artaxerxes Mnemon, who is said to have had a hundred and fifteen children, and died of grief at the age of ninety-four at the suicide of one son and the murder of another. Wordsworth opines that Solomon, in the previous verse, was thinking of Jeroboam, who, it was revealed unto him, should, stranger as he was, seize and enjoy his inheritance. But these historical references are the merest guesswork, and rest upon no substantial basis. Plainly the author's statement is general, and there is no need to ransack history to find its parallel. <span class="cmt_word">And live many years, so that the days of his years be many</span>; <span class="accented">Et vixerit multos annos</span>, <span class="accented">et plures dies aetatis habuerit</span> (Vulgate). These versions seem to be simply tautological. The second clause is climacteric, as Ginsburg renders, "Yea, numerous as may be the days of his years." The whole extent of years is summed up in days. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>, "The days of our years are three score years and ten," etc. Long life, again, was deemed a special blessing, as we see in the commandment with promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">yet if</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his soul not filled with good</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he does not satisfy himself with the enjoyment of all the good things which he possesses. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "And his soul shall not be satisfied with his good." <span class="cmt_word">And also that he have no burial.</span> This is the climax of the evil that befalls him. Some critics, not entering into Koheleth's view of the severity of this calamity, translate, "and even if the grave did not wait for him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "if he were never to die," if he were immortal. But there is no parallel to show that the clause can have this meaning; and we know, without having recourse to Greek precedents, that the want of burial was reckoned a grievous loss and dishonor. Hence comes the common allusion to dead carcasses being left to be devoured by beasts and birds, instead of meeting with honorable burial in the ancestral graves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-22.htm">1 Kings 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18-20</a>). Thus David says to his giant foe, "I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>); and about Jehoiakim it was denounced that he should not be lamented when he died: "He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). The lot of the rich man in question is proclaimed with ever-increasing misery. Ha cannot enjoy his possessions; he has none to whom to leave them; his memory perishes; he has no honored burial. <span class="cmt_word">I say, that an untimely birth is better than he</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>). The abortion or still-born child is preferable to one whose destiny is so miserable (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>). It is preferable because, although it has missed all the pleasures of life, it has at least escaped all suffering. The next two verses illustrate this position. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-6 A man often has all he needs for outward enjoyment; yet the Lord leaves him so to covetousness or evil dispositions, that he makes no good or comfortable use of what he has. By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to suffer.</body></html>
