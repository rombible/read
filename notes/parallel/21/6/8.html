What advantage hath the wise man over the fool? This verse confirms the previous one by an interrogative argument.

(For a similar interrogation implying an emphatic denial, see Ecclesiastes 1:30) <span class="cmt_word">What hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?</span> The Septuagint gives the verse thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (A, C, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For what advantage hath the wise man over the fool? since the poor man knows how to walk before life?" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid habet amplius sapiens a stulto? et quid pauper</span>, <span class="accented">nisi ut pergat illuc</span>, <span class="accented">ubi est vita?</span> "And what hath the poor man except that he go thither where is life?" Both these versions regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> as used in the sense of "life," and that the life beyond the grave; but this idea is foreign to the context; and the expression must be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "the living." The interpretation of the clause has much exercised critics. Plumptre adheres to that of Bernstein and others, "What advantage hath the poor over him who knows how to walk before the living?' (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the man of high birth or station, who lives in public, with the eyes of men upon him). The poor has his cares and unsatisfied desires as much as the man of culture and position. Poverty offers no protection against such assaults, But the expression, to <span class="accented">know how to walk before the living</span>, means to understand and to follow the correct path of life; to know how to behave properly and uprightly in the intercourse with one's fellow-men; to have what the French call <span class="accented">savoir vivre</span>. (So Volok.) The question must be completed thus: "What advantage has the discreet and properly conducted poor man over the fool?" None, at least in this respect. The poor man, even though he be well vetoed in the rule of life, has insatiable desires which he has to check or conceal, and so is no better off than the fool, who equally is unable to gratify them. The two 'extremities of the social scale are taken - the rich wise man, and the prudent poor man - and both are shown to fail in enjoying life; and what is true of these must be also true of all that come between these two limits, "the appetite is not filled" (ver. 7). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:7-12 A little will serve to sustain us comfortably, and a great deal can do no more. The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.</body></html>
