To" see the sun" is a metaphor for to "live," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>, and implies activity and work, the contrary of rest. <span class="cmt_word">This hath more rest than the other</span>; literally, <span class="accented">there is rest to this more than to that</span>. The rest that belongs to the abortion is better than that which belongs to the rich man. Others take the clause to say simply, "It is better with this than the other." So the Revised Version margin and Delitzsch, the idea of "rest" being thus generalized, and taken to sights a preferable choice. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "And hath not known rest for this more than that " - which reproduces the difficulty of the Hebrew; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque cognovit distantiam boni et malt</span>, which is a paraphrase unsupported by the present accentuation of the text. Rest, in the conception of an Oriental, is the most desirable or' all things; compared with the busy, careworn life of the rich man, whose very moments of leisure and sleep are troubled and disturbed, the dreamless nothingness of the still-born child is happiness. This may be a rhetorical exaggeration, but we have its parallel in Job's lamentable cry in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. when he "cursed his day." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-6 A man often has all he needs for outward enjoyment; yet the Lord leaves him so to covetousness or evil dispositions, that he makes no good or comfortable use of what he has. By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to suffer.</body></html>
