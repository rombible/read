The word rendered "already," <span class="accented">kebar</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>), "long ago," though used elsewhere in this book of events in human history, may appropriately be applied to the Divine decrees which predetermine the circumstances of man's life. This is its significance in the present passage, which asserts that everything which happens has been known and fixed beforehand, and therefore that man cannot shape his own life. No attempt is here made to reconcile this doctrine with man's free-will and consequent responsibility. The idea has already been presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, etc. It comes forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>, "Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-18.htm">Acts 15:18</a> (according to the Textus Receptus), "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world." The same idea is brought out more fully in the following clauses. Septuagint, "If anything ever was, already hath its name been called," which gives the correct sense of the passage. The Vulgate is not so happy, <span class="accented">Qui futurus est</span>, <span class="accented">jam vocatum est nomen ejus</span>, being rather opposed to the grammar. <span class="cmt_word">And it is known that it is man</span>. What is meant by the Authorized Version is doubtful. If the first clause had been translated, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "Whatsoever he be, his name was given him long ago," the conclusion would come naturally, "and it is known that he is man" (<span class="accented">Adam</span>), and we should see an allusion to man's name and to the ground (adamah) from which he was taken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), as if his very name betokened his weakness. But the present version is very obscure. Cox gives, "It is very certain that even the greatest is but a man, and cannot contend with him," etc. But the Hebrew will not admit this rendering. The clause really amplifies the previous statement of man's predetermined destiny, and it should be rendered, "And it is known what a man shall be." Every individual comes under God's prescient superintendence. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "It is known what man is;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et scitur quod homo sit</span>. But it is not the nature of man that is in question, but his conditioned state. <span class="cmt_word">Neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</span> The <span class="accented">mightier</span> One is God, in accordance with the passages quoted above from Isaiah, Acts, and Romans. Some consider that death is intended, and that the author is referring to the shortness of man's life. They say that the word <span class="accented">taqqiph</span>, "mighty" (which occurs only in Ezra and Daniel), is never used of God. But is it used of death? And is it not used of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3</a> (3:33, Hebrew), where Nebuchadnezzar says, "How mighty are his wonders"? To bring death into consideration is to introduce a new thought having no connection with the context, which is not speaking of the termination of man's life, but of its course, the circumstances of which are arranged by a higher Power. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. With this we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-22.htm">1 Corinthians 10:22</a>, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>;)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:7-12 A little will serve to sustain us comfortably, and a great deal can do no more. The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.</body></html>
