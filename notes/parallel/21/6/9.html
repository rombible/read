This is a further confirmation of the misery and unrest that accompany immoderate desires. "The sight of the eyes" means the enjoyment of the present, that which lies before one, in contrast to the restless craving for what is distant, uncertain, and out of reach. The lesson taught is to make the best of existing circumstances, to enjoy the present, to control the roaming of fancy, and to narrow the vast field of appetency. We have a striking expression in Wisd. 4:12, <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> by which is denoted the giddiness, the reeling intoxication, caused by unrestrained passion. The Roman satirist lashed the sin of unscrupulous greed- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Seal quae reverentia legum,<br />Quis rectus aut pudor eat unquam properantis avari?"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Juven., 'Sat.,' 14:177.</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Nor law, nor checks of conscience will he hear,<br />When in hot scent of gain and full career."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Dryden.</span>) Zockler quotes Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:18. 96, <span class="accented">sqq -</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Inter cuncta leges et percontabere doctos,<br />Qua ratione queas traducere leniter aevum;<br />Num te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,<br />Num paver et return mediocriter utilium spes."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"To sum up all -<br />Consult and con the wise<br />In what the art of true contentment lies:<br />How fear and hope, that rack the human will,<br />Are but vain dreams of things nor good nor ill."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) <span class="accented">Marc. Aurel., 'Meditat.,' 4:26,</span> Has any advantage happened to you? It is the bounty of fate. It was all preordained you by the universal cause. Upon the whole, life is but short, therefore be just and prudent, and make your most of it; and when you divert yourself, be always on your guard' (J. Collier). Well is it added that this insatiability of the soul, which never leads to contentment, is vanity and vexation of spirit, a feeding on wind, empty, unsatisfying. Commentators refer in illustration to the fable of the dog and the shadow, and the proverb, A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:7-12 A little will serve to sustain us comfortably, and a great deal can do no more. The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.</body></html>
