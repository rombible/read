but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:">2Chronicles 1:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor.</span> This is the evil to which reference is made. Two of the words here given, "riches" and "honor," are those used by God in blessing Solomon in the vision at Gibeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>); but all three are employed in the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-11.htm">2 Chronicles 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth.</span> "His soul" is the man himself, his personality, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a>. So in the parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>) the rich fool says to his soul, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years." In the supposed case the man is able to procure for himself everything which he wants; has no occasion to deny himself the gratification of any rising desire. All this comes from God's bounty; but something more is wanted to bring happiness. <span class="cmt_word">Yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof.</span> "To eat" is used in a metaphorical sense for "to enjoy," take advantage of, make due use of (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24). The ability to enjoy all these good things is wanting, either from discontent, or moroseness, or sickness, or as a punishment for secret sin. <span class="cmt_word">But a stranger eateth it</span>. The "stranger" is not the legal heir, but an alien to the possessor's blood, neither relation nor even necessarily a friend. For a childless Oriental to adopt an heir is a common custom at the present day. The wish to continue a family, to leave a name and inheritance to children's children, was very strong among the Hebrews - all the stronger as the life beyond the grave was dimly apprehended. Abraham expressed this feeling when he sadly cried, "I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Dammesek Eliezer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>). The evils are two - that this great fortune brings no happiness to its possessor, and that it passes to one who is nothing to him. <span class="cmt_word">An evil disease</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, Septuagint, an evil as bad as the diseases spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 28</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-6 A man often has all he needs for outward enjoyment; yet the Lord leaves him so to covetousness or evil dispositions, that he makes no good or comfortable use of what he has. By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to suffer.</body></html>
