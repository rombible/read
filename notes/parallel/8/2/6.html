She is "the (rather "a") Moabitish damsel," she is a foreigner [as such she had a <span class= "ital">special </span>claim to the gleaning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-9.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>]. She is the daughter-in-law of Naomi; and he adds that her behaviour has been praiseworthy, for she asked leave before beginning to glean, and she has worked hard all day, save for a short interval of rest. It would seem that Boaz's visit to the field fell at the time when Ruth was thus resting: "This is her tarrying for a little in the house"; apparently, that is, some rude shelter from the heat set up in the field, like the <span class= "ital">lodge </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the young man who was set over the reapers replied and said, She is a Moabitish young woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.</span> The young man had already received, no doubt from her own lips, particulars regarding the attractive stranger. Instead of the free definitive rendering of Luther and King James's English version, "<span class="accented">the</span> Moabitish damsel," it is better, with Michaelis, Wright, Raabe, to adhere to the original indefiniteness, "a Moabitish maiden." Note the Zeugmatic use of the word <span class="accented">returned</span> as applied here, as well as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a>, not only to Naomi, but also to Ruth. It is thus used on the same Zeugmatic principle as the <span class="accented">word die</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-19.htm">Genesis 47:19</a>: "Wherefore shall we <span class="accented">die</span> before thine eyes, both we and <span class="accented">our land?"</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:4-16 The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows that there were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.</body></html>
