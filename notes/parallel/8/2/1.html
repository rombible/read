But <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> is ambiguous in import. It primarily means <span class="accented">known</span>, <span class="accented">well-known</span>, <span class="accented">acquainted</span>, <span class="accented">an acquaintance</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8, 18</a>). But as intimate acquaintances, especially in a primitive and comparatively unwelded state of society, are generally found within the circle of kinsfolk, the word may be used, and is here used, in reference to a <span class="accented">kinsman</span>. The Vulgate translates it <span class="accented">consanguineus</span>. The translation is interpretatively correct; but the original term is less definite, and hence, in virtue of the ambiguity, there is not absolute redundancy in the appended clause, <span class="accented">of the family</span> or <span class="accented">elan of Elimelech</span>. This friend of Naomi on her husband s side is said, in King James's version, to be <span class="cmt_word">a mighty man of wealth.</span> But the expression so rendered has, in the very numerous passages in which it occurs, a conventional import that stretches out in a different and nobler direction. It is the expression that is so frequently translated "<span class="accented">a</span> mighty man of valor (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>, etc.). In only one other passage is it rendered as it is by King James's translators in the passage before us, viz., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>. There it is correctly so translated, interpretatively. Here there seems to be a leaning in the same direction, and yet it is not strongly pronounced. Cassel, however, takes the other cue, and translates "a valiant hero "Probably," says he "he had distinguished himself in the conflicts of Israel with their enemies." The expression originally means "strong in strength" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">Sept</span>.), but is ambiguous in consequence of the many-sided import of the latter word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which means originally, either <span class="accented">strength</span>, and then <span class="accented">valor</span>; or, <span class="accented">clannish following</span> (see Raabe), and then <span class="accented">military host</span>, or <span class="accented">force</span>, or <span class="accented">forces</span>; also, <span class="accented">faculty</span> or <span class="accented">ability</span>, and then, as so often "answering all things," <span class="accented">riches</span> or <span class="accented">wealth</span>. The idea the writer seems to be that the friend of the widow's husband <span class="accented">was a strong and substantial yeoman</span>. He was <span class="cmt_word">of the family or clan of Elimelech.</span> The word <span class="accented">family</span> is conventionally too narrow, and the word <span class="accented">elan</span> too broad, to represent the import of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> as here used. The idea intended lies somewhere between. <span class="cmt_word">And his name was Boaz.</span> The root of this name is not found, apparently, in Hebrew, as was supposed by the older philologists, and hence its essential idea is as yet undetermined. Raabe finds its original form in the Sanscrit <span class="accented">bhuvanti</span>, which yields the idea of <span class="accented">prosperousness</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-3 Observe Ruth's humility. When Providence had made her poor, she cheerfully stoops to her lot. High spirits will rather starve than stoop; not so Ruth. Nay, it is her own proposal. She speaks humbly in her expectation of leave to glean. We may not demand kindness as a debt, but ask, and take it as a favour, though in a small matter. Ruth also was an example of industry. She loved not to eat the bread of idleness. This is an example to young people. Diligence promises well, both for this world and the other. We must not be shy of any honest employment. No labour is a reproach. Sin is a thing below us, but we must not think any thing else so, to which Providence call us. She was an example of regard to her mother, and of trust in Providence. God wisely orders what seem to us small events; and those that appear altogether uncertain, still are directed to serve his own glory, and the good of his people.</body></html>
