She had respectfully solicited leave to glean. <span class="cmt_word">She said, Let me glean, I pray thee, and gather in bundles after the reapers.</span> The expression, "and gather in bundles," is in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> and is rendered in King James's version, as also by Coverdale, Tremellius, Castellio, Luther, Michaelis, "and gather among" or "beside the sheaves." But such a request on the part of Ruth would seem to be too bold, the more especially as we find Boaz afterwards giving instructions to the young men to allow her, without molestation, to glean "even between the sheaves" (ver. 15). Hence Pagnin's free version is to be preferred, "<span class="accented">and</span> gather bundles" (<span class="accented">et congregabo manipulos</span>). Carpzov pleads for the same interpretation, and translates thus: "Let me, I pray thee, glean, and collect the gleanings into bundles (<span class="accented">colligam obsecro spicas</span>, <span class="accented">collectasque accumulem in manipules</span>). Montanus too adopts it, and Raabe likewise (<span class="accented">und sammele zu Haufen</span>). The steward praises Ruth s industry. <span class="cmt_word">And she came, and has remained ever since the morning until just now.</span> She had worked with scarcely any intermission, diligently, from early morning. Drusius says that the following expression, rendered in King James's version <span class="cmt_word">that she tarried a little in the house,</span> occasioned him critical torture (<span class="accented">locus hie et diu et acriter me torsit</span>). Coverdale also had been inextricably perplexed. He renders it, "<span class="accented">And</span> within a litel whyle she wolde have bene gone home <span class="accented">agayne</span>." The word house troubled these and many other interpreters, as if the reference were to Naomi s dwelling-house in the town. The reference, however, is evidently to a temporary but, shed, tent, or booth erected in the harvest-field for the siesta of the workers, and the accommodation of the master, when he was visiting by day, or exercising supervision by night. We would translate the clause thus - "Her resting at the but (has been) little." Her siesta in the shade of the but was trot brief. She felt as if she could not afford a long repose. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:4-16 The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows that there were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.</body></html>
