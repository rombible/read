clearly the account he had heard of Ruth, both from his servant and from general report, as well as her appearance and behaviour and doubtless a feeling of pity at her condition, had prepossessed him in her favour.<p><span class= "bld">Abide her fast by my maidens.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">cleave to </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>). The true courtesy of Boaz's character shows itself in the mention of the maidens. He will not have the stranger even run the chance of rudeness, by being away from the company of her own sex. As the next verse shows, he had already given orders to his men on the subject.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Boaz said to Ruth.</span> We are to suppose that Boaz, having communicated with his overseer, and having given some instructions to his rearers, and likewise to the young women who bound the reaped corn into sheaves, moved onward to the place where Ruth, keeping modestly far in the rear, was gleaning. He entered into conversation with her, and, among other things, said to her, <span class="cmt_word">Hearest thou not, my daughter!</span> A grave antique way of drawing special attention to what is about to follow. "<span class="accented">My</span> daughter" is a fatherly expression, appropriate on the part of an elderly person when addressing a young woman. <span class="cmt_word">Do not go to glean in the other field.</span> Pointing, no doubt, as he spoke, to a parcel of adjoining fields, belonging to a neighbor proprietor. Boaz's interest and sympathy went out strong, all at once, toward the daughter-in-law of his deceased relative. His heart was smitten with admiration for the modest and fascinating widow. He said further to her, as he walked on along with her in the direction of the reapers, <span class="cmt_word">and also do not pass on hence.</span> The expression is not a redundant repetition of the preceding utterance. It was intended, apparently, to direct Ruth to a particular line of gleaning-ground, probably right behind the sheaf-binders, which it would be advantageous for her to occupy. He would point it out with his hand. <span class="cmt_word">And so keep close by my young women.</span> Their proximity would give the stranger a feeling of security, and her nearness to them in their work would be manifestly for her benefit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:4-16 The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows that there were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.</body></html>
