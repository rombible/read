He began by <span class="accented">taking notice</span> of her. There is an interesting <span class="accented">paranomasia</span> in the two words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. A foreigner, though <span class="accented">unknown</span>, and just indeed because <span class="accented">unknown</span>, is naturally noted and <span class="accented">noticed</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:4-16 The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows that there were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.</body></html>
