Either way a good sense is obtained. As our lost dear ones had kindness shown them of old, so we too now. If Boaz is the antecedent, it may seem curious that Naomi (knowing that she was dwelling near to a kinsman of her husband's, and, further, one who had shown kindness before they departed to Moab) should not have made herself known to him. It is, at any rate, a proof of the independence of her character. However, the name once named evidently suggests the train of thought which at length leads Naomi to appeal to him for a kinsman's special aid, the aid of the <span class= "ital">Goel </span>or redeemer.<p><span class= "bld">One of our next kinsmen.</span>--One of those who must redeem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed 'of' Yahveh be he who - .</span> The expression is literally, "Blessed 'to' Yahveh be, he who," that is, "Blessed in relation to Yahveh be he who," or "Blessed be he! I carry the desire and prayer up to Yahveh," which just amounts, in meaning, to this: "<span class="accented">Blessed</span> ' by' Yahveh be he who." See other instances of the same construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-15.htm">Psalm 115:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Who has not let go his kindness to the living and to the dead.</span> Some take these words to be descriptive of Yahveh. Others take them to be descriptive of Boaz. If they be regarded in the former point of view, then the foregoing clause must be rendered, not, "Blessed by Yahveh be he who," but, "Blessed be he by Yahveh who." Dr. Cassel assumes, but without any formal reasoning or apparent reason, that the reference of the relative is to Yahveh, and hence he makes out an ingenious argument in defense of the doctrine, <span class="accented">that those who are dead to us are yet alive to</span> God - the doctrine of immortality. It is strained. Yet Raabe thinks that the reference is to Yahveh, inasmuch as Naomi had as yet no evidence of Boaz's kindness to the deceased. The reason thus given for carrying the reference up to God is certainly unsatisfactory; for, looking at the subject from the human point of view, it is obvious that Boaz's peculiar kindness to the living was his kindness to the deceased; whereas, if we look at the case from the Divine point of view, it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for the discrimination between the living and the dead. The first feeling that sprang up in the heart of Naomi at the mention of the name of Boaz was one of adoration. The next was a generous desire in reference to Boaz himself. She prayed that he might be graciously recompensed by Yahveh for the kindness he had shown that day, both toward the living - Ruth and herself - and toward the deceased - Elimelech and his sons. A man of less noble nature might have been ready, in reference to relatives in reduced circumstances, to ignore the present, and to bury in oblivion the past. After giving scope to her feelings of adoration and benediction, Naomi, with the prompt and practical directness of a true woman, said to her daughter-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">The man is near to us</span>, adding immediately, and with a rapid glance at bright contingencies that were in the region of the possible, <span class="cmt_word">He is one of our peculiar kinsmen</span> (our <span class="accented">Goelim</span>). She meant that he was one of those peculiarly near kinsmen who had a right of redemption over' whatever lands may have formerly belonged to her, and the first right of purchase over whatever lands might yet remain in the possession of herself or of her daughter-in-law. Naomi and Ruth, though greatly reduced in circumstances, and painfully pent up in present straits, were far from being Paupers. They were proprietors (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3, 5</a>). But their property was not, for the time being, available for income or sustenance. It had either been farmed out on usufruct or allowed to lie waste. In the absence of the <span class="accented">yod</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> we have an instance of <span class="accented">scriptio defectiva</span>, as distinguished from <span class="accented">scriptio plena</span>. Such defective manuscription might be expected to occur occasionally in transcription from dictation, when, as here, the presence or the absence of the letter made no difference in the pronunciation of the reader. Michaelis, however ('Mosaisches Recht,' &sect; 137), and Gesenius ('Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in voc</span>.), instead of regarding the absence of the <span class="accented">yod</span> as an instance of <span class="accented">scriptio defectiva</span>, have conjectured that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> is a noun, or name, meaning <span class="accented">the seemed in order of the Goelim</span>. But, notwithstanding the ingenuity of the conjecture, there is not a shadow of evidence to evince that the Hebrews themselves ever knew of such a word. Nor does the supposition or subsumption of such a word in the least facilitate the construction on the one hand, or illumine the narrative on the other. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-23 It encourages industry, that in all labour, even that of gleaning, there is profit. Ruth was pleased with what she gained by her own industry, and was careful to secure it. Let us thus take care that we lose not those things which we have wrought, which we have gained for our souls' good, 2Jo 1:8. Parents should examine their children, as Naomi did, not to frighten or discourage them, so as to make them hate home, or tempt them to tell a lie; but to commend them if they have done well, and with mildness to reprove and caution them if they have done otherwise. It is a good question for us to ask ourselves every night, Where have I gleaned to-day? What improvement have I made in knowledge and grace? What have I done that will turn to a good account? When the Lord deals bountifully with us, let us not be found in any other field, nor seeking for happiness and satisfaction in the creature. We lose Divine favours, if we slight them. Ruth dutifully observed her mother's directions. And when the harvest was ended, she kept her aged mother company at home. Dinah went out to see the daughters of the land; her vanity ended in disgrace, Ge 34. Ruth kept at home, and helped to maintain her mother, and went out on no other errand than to get provision for her; her humility and industry ended in preferment.</body></html>
