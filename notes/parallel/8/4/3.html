In the year of Jubilee, the property would return to the family, on which it was, so to speak, settled, but Boaz proposes to the <span class= "ital">Goel </span>that he should redeem the property at once. We might perhaps compare this to the owner of a freehold buying from a leaseholder under him the residue of his lease, so that he may occupy his own estate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, has resolved to sell the portion of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.</span> Boaz, it is evident, had talked over with Ruth the entire details of Naomi's plans, and could thus speak authoritatively. Naomi, we must suppose, had previously taken Ruth into full confidence, so that Boaz could learn at second- hand what in other circumstances he would have learned from Naomi herself. The verb which we have rendered "has resolved to sell," is literally "has sold," and has been so rendered by many expositors, inclusive of Riegler and Wright. The Syriac translator gives the expression thus, "has sold to me." The subsequent context, however, makes it evident that the property had not been sold to any one, and consequently not to Boaz. The perfect verb is to be accounted for on the principle explained by Driver when he says, "The perfect is employed to indicate actions, the accomplishment of which lies indeed in the future, but is regarded as dependent upon such an unalterable determination of the will that it may be spoken of as having actually taken place: thus a resolution, promise, or decree, especially a Divine one, is very frequently announced in the perfect tense. A striking instance is afforded by Ruth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3</a>) when Boaz, speaking of Naomi's determination to sell her land, says <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, literally, 'has sold' (has resolved to sell. The English idiom would be 'is selling')" ('Treatise on the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew,' pp. 13, 14). In King James's English version the verb is thus freely rendered "<span class="accented">selleth</span>." Luther's version is <span class="accented">equivalent - beut feil</span>, "<span class="accented">offers</span> for sale;" or, as Coverdale renders it, "<span class="accented">offereth</span> to sell." Vatable freely renders it as we have done, "has determined to sell" (<span class="accented">vendere decrepit</span>) so Drusius (<span class="accented">vendere instituit</span>). The kind family feeling of Boaz, shining out m the expression, "our <span class="accented">brother</span> Ehmelech," is noteworthy. "Brother" was to him a homely and gracious term for "near kinsman." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 This matter depended on the laws given by Moses about inheritances, and doubtless the whole was settled in the regular and legal manner. This kinsman, when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it. In like manner many are shy of the great redemption; they are not willing to espouse religion; they have heard well of it, and have nothing to say against it; they will give it their good word, but they are willing to part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring their own inheritance in this world. The right was resigned to Boaz. Fair and open dealing in all matters of contract and trade, is what all must make conscience of, who would approve themselves true Israelites, without guile. Honesty will be found the best policy.</body></html>
