The derivation is probably from <span class= "ital">palah, </span>to mark out, to separate, to distinguish, and <span class= "ital">alam, </span>to hide, giving the twofold notion of one who is indicated, though in a certain sense concealed. The phrase is used of places, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-2.htm" title="And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.">1Samuel 21:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-8.htm" title="Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.">2Kings 6:8</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13</a>. Why the name is not recorded here does not appear; possibly it was not known to the writer, or it may have been thought unworthy of recording, since he neglected his plain duty in refusing to raise up seed to the dead. We know nothing of this unnamed person save the fact of the offering of the redemption set before him, and his refusal of it, an offer which involved the glory of being the ancestor of the Christ who was to be born in the far-off ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Boaz went up, to the gate, and sat there.</span> He "went up," for the city stood, as it still stands, on a ridge (see on Ruth 1:1; 3:6). "And sat there," on one of the stones, or stone benches, that were set for the accommodation of the townsfolk. The gateway in the East often corresponded, as a place of meeting, to the forum, or the market-place, in the West. Boaz had reason to believe that his kinsman would be either passing out to his fields, or passing in from his threshing-floor, through the one gate of the city. <span class="cmt_word">And lo, the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken was passing; and he said, Ho, such a one I turn hither and sit here.</span> And he turned and sat down. Boaz called his kinsman by his name; but the writer does not name him, either because he could not, or because he would not. The phrase "such a one," or "so and so," is a purely idiomatic English equivalent for the purely idiomatic Hebrew phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. A literal translation is impossible. The Latin <span class="accented">N</span>.<span class="accented">N</span>. corresponds. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 This matter depended on the laws given by Moses about inheritances, and doubtless the whole was settled in the regular and legal manner. This kinsman, when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it. In like manner many are shy of the great redemption; they are not willing to espouse religion; they have heard well of it, and have nothing to say against it; they will give it their good word, but they are willing to part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring their own inheritance in this world. The right was resigned to Boaz. Fair and open dealing in all matters of contract and trade, is what all must make conscience of, who would approve themselves true Israelites, without guile. Honesty will be found the best policy.</body></html>
