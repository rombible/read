She knew in what relation Boaz stood for her family, and the duties attaching to the relationship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-20.htm" title="And Naomi said to her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.

And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.">Ruth 3:9</a>). Thus with obedient trust, implicitly but not blindly, she follows her mother-in-law's orders; strong in conscious innocence she risks the obloquy that may attend her duty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said, All that thou sayest I will do.</span> There is no need for adopting into the text the K'ri "<span class="accented">to</span> me," after the expression, All that thou sayest." It is a mere "tittle," indeed, whether we omit or insert the pronoun; yet it was not found in the manuscripts that lay before the Septuagint and Vulgate translators. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The married state should be a rest, as much as any thing upon earth can be so, as it ought to fix the affections and form a connexion for life. Therefore it should be engaged in with great seriousness, with earnest prayers for direction, for the blessing of God, and with regard to his precepts. Parents should carefully advise their children in this important concern, that it may be well with them as to their souls. Be it always remembered, That is best for us which is best for our souls. The course Naomi advised appears strange to us; but it was according to the laws and usages of Israel. If the proposed measure had borne the appearance of evil, Naomi would not have advised it. Law and custom gave Ruth, who was now proselyted to the true religion, a legal claim upon Boaz. It was customary for widows to assert this claim, De 25:5-10. But this is not recorded for imitation in other times, and is not to be judged by modern rules. And if there had been any evil in it, Ruth was a woman of too much virtue and too much sense to have listened to it.</body></html>
