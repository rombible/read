(Henry.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she lay at the place of his feet until morning: and she arose ere yet a man could distinguish his neighbor.</span> In the original it is "<span class="accented">the</span> places of his feet" (see ver. 4). Time would rapidly fly past. Sleep there would be none to either the one or the other. In mutual modesty they guarded each other's honor. Thoughts and feelings, narratives and projects, would be freely interchanged. Their mutual understanding would become complete. At length there began to be the first faint tinge of paleness streaking into the dark. Ruth arose, and prepared to depart. It is added, <span class="cmt_word">For he had said,</span> - or, more literally, "And he had said," - <span class="cmt_word">Let it not be known that 'the' woman came to the threshing-floor.</span> This has been to critics a puzzling clause. The conjunction in the foreground, a mere copulative, has occasioned difficulty. It is thoroughly Hebraistic. But of course it does not here introduce to notice something merely added to what goes before, of the nature of a parting injunction or request addressed to Ruth. The articulated phrase "<span class="accented">the</span> woman," as distinguished from "a woman," the expression in King James's version, renders such an interpretation impossible. The Targumist explains thus: "<span class="accented">and</span> he said <span class="accented">to his young men</span>." But the whole tenor of the preceding narrative proceeds on the assumption that there were no servants on the premises or at hand. Other Rabbis, and after them Luther and Cover-dale, interpret thus: "and he said <span class="accented">in his</span> heart," or, "<span class="accented">and</span> he thought." Unnatural. The difficulty is to be credited, or debited, to simplicity of composition, and the habit of just adding thing to thing aggregatively, instead of interweaving them into a complex unity. In the course of their many interchanges of thought and feeling, Boaz had expressed a desire, both for Ruth s sake and for his own, that it should not be known that she had come by night to the threshing-floor. The narrator, instead of introducing this expression of desire in the way in which it would directly fall from the lips of Boaz, "<span class="accented">Let</span> it not be known that <span class="accented">thou</span> didst come," gives it in the indirect form of speech, the <span class="accented">oratio obliqua</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> his own statement of the case. It is as if he had introduced a parenthesis or added a note in the margin. The <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> -instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>- was most probably not a later form, as Berthean supposes, but an older Hebrew form that had died out of use long before the days of the Masorites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-18 Ruth had done all that was fit for her to do, she must patiently wait the event. Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would be sure to manage it well. Much more reason have true believers to cast their care on God, because he has promised to care for them. Our strength is to sit still, Isa 30:7. This narrative may encourage us to lay ourselves by faith at the feet of Christ: He is our near Kinsman; having taken our nature upon him. He has the right to redeem. Let us seek to receive from him his directions: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Ac 9:6. He will never blame us as doing this unseasonably. And let us earnestly desire and seek the same rest for our children and friends, that it may be well with them also.</body></html>
