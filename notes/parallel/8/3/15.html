It must be allowed that a fair number of Hebrew MSS., as well as the Peshito and Vulgate, take the verb in the feminine. The LXX. is from the nature of the Greek language unable to mark the distinction. The clause. if we accept the current reading, will mean that Boaz went to the city to find the kinsman whose claim lay before his own, while Ruth, laden with six measures of barley, goes to her mother-in-law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Allow me the wrapper which is upon thee, and hold on by it; and she held on by it; and he measured six measures of barley; and he put it on her, and went to the city.</span> The expression "Allow me," literally, "Give (me)," was a current phrase of courtesy. The verb employed - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> - was common Semitic property, ere yet the mother-tongue was subdivided into Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldee, Arabic. <span class="cmt_word">The wrapper which is upon thee.</span> The word for <span class="accented">wrapper</span> occurs nowhere else except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-22.htm">Isaiah 3:22</a>, where it is translated, in King James's version, "wimple." Here it is rendered "vail," and, in the margin, "sheet or apron," - all of them unhappy translations. So is the rendering of the Targumist, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. <span class="accented">sudarium</span>, or "napkin." N.G. Schroder discusses the word at great length in his masterly 'Commentarius Philologico-Criticus de Vestitu Mulierum Hebraearum,' pp. 247-277. He would render it <span class="accented">pallium</span> or <span class="accented">palla</span> In consequence of national peculiarities in articles of dress, especially in ancient times, it is best to avoid a specific, and to employ a generic translation. When Boaz said, "Give me the <span class="accented">wrapper</span>," he did not ask that it should be handed to him. He had already put his hand upon it, and was engaged in hollowing out a scoop or cavity. Hence he said, on the one hand, "Allow me," and, on the other, "Hold on by it." <span class="cmt_word">And he measured six measures of barley.</span> The particular measure referred to is unspecified. It is not only mere dream on the part of the Targumist, but it is dream involving almost sheer impossibility, that the measures were <span class="accented">seahs</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two ephahs. The Targumist had to bolster up his dream by adding another, viz., that Ruth got miraculously strength to carry the load. Load, indeed, there undoubtedly was; and no doubt it would be as great as she could conveniently carry. And likewise, in accordance with the primitive simplicity of manners, the magnitude of the burden would be demonstration to Naomi of Boaz's satisfaction with the "<span class="accented">measures"</span> which, in full motherliness of spirit, she had planned. <span class="cmt_word">And he went to the city.</span> The Vulgate and Syriac versions, as also Castellio, Coverdale, and various other translators, but not Luther, have assumed that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "and she went," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "and he went." So too Wright. But there seems to be no good reason for making the change. If there had been no division into verses, then the departure of both Boaz and Ruth on their respective routes, or in their respective order of sequence, would have been recorded close together: "and 'he' went to the city, and 'she' went to her mother-in-law" - each, let us bear in mind, with the heart elate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-18 Ruth had done all that was fit for her to do, she must patiently wait the event. Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would be sure to manage it well. Much more reason have true believers to cast their care on God, because he has promised to care for them. Our strength is to sit still, Isa 30:7. This narrative may encourage us to lay ourselves by faith at the feet of Christ: He is our near Kinsman; having taken our nature upon him. He has the right to redeem. Let us seek to receive from him his directions: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Ac 9:6. He will never blame us as doing this unseasonably. And let us earnestly desire and seek the same rest for our children and friends, that it may be well with them also.</body></html>
