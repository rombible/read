Naomi was quick to note the varying '<span class="accented">nuances</span> of feeling, and said "<span class="accented">My</span> daughter, shall I not seek out for thee a rest?" The expression <span class="accented">rest</span>, or <span class="accented">resting-place</span>, though in itself of generic import, was, when used in such circumstances as environed Ruth, quite specific in application, and would be at once understood. It was <span class="accented">a home</span> to which Naomi pointed, a home for her daughter's heart. In such a home, if warm and pure, there would be repose for the affections. "That it may be well with thee," or, "which shall (or may) be good for thee." Either translation is warrantable and excellent. The latter is the most simple, and is given by Carpzov and Rosenm&uuml;ller; but the former is in accordance with a frequent idiomatic use of the expression, in which there is a change <span class="accented">from the relative in result to the relative in aim</span>, so that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-11.htm">Deuteronomy 10:11</a>, 25, 28). Naomi did not distinguish between <span class="accented">rests</span> that would be 'good, ' and other <span class="accented">rests</span> which would not be 'good.' Nor did she moralize on the idea of a <span class="accented">rest</span>, and affirm that it would be 'good' for her widowed daughter-in-law. She assumed that <span class="accented">every</span> true <span class="accented">rest</span> was 'good,' and, on the basis of that assumption, she sought out one for her devoted Ruth. Hence the superiority of the rendering that expresses <span class="accented">aim</span> to that which expresses the mere prediction of <span class="accented">result</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The married state should be a rest, as much as any thing upon earth can be so, as it ought to fix the affections and form a connexion for life. Therefore it should be engaged in with great seriousness, with earnest prayers for direction, for the blessing of God, and with regard to his precepts. Parents should carefully advise their children in this important concern, that it may be well with them as to their souls. Be it always remembered, That is best for us which is best for our souls. The course Naomi advised appears strange to us; but it was according to the laws and usages of Israel. If the proposed measure had borne the appearance of evil, Naomi would not have advised it. Law and custom gave Ruth, who was now proselyted to the true religion, a legal claim upon Boaz. It was customary for widows to assert this claim, De 25:5-10. But this is not recorded for imitation in other times, and is not to be judged by modern rules. And if there had been any evil in it, Ruth was a woman of too much virtue and too much sense to have listened to it.</body></html>
