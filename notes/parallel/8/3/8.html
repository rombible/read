What could it be? In a moment or two he recovered his self-possession, and bending himself up and over, or "crooking himself, to see and to feel, lo, a woman was lying at his feet. The Chaldee Targumist tumbles into a ludicrous bathos of taste when endeavoring to emphasize the startle and shiver which Boas experienced. He says, "He trembled, <span class="accented">and his flesh</span>, <span class="accented">became soft as a turnip</span> from the agitation. How could the most peddling and paltering of Rabbis succeed in betraying himself into such a laughable puerility and absurdity? The explanation, though of course it is not the least atom of justification, lies in the fact that the Chaldee word for "turnip" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> while the verb that de notes "he bent himself" is the niphal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. The use of the expression "<span class="accented">the</span> man," in this and several of the adjoining verses, is apt to grate a little upon English ears. Let us explain and vindicate the term as we may, the grating is still felt. No matter though we know that "<span class="accented">the</span> rank is but the guinea stamp," the grating is felt inevitably. It is a result of that peculiar growth in living language that splits generic terms into such as are specific or semi-specific. We have <span class="accented">gentleman</span> as well as <span class="accented">man</span>, and embarrassment is not infrequently the result of our linguistic wealth. In the verse before us, and in some of those that go before, we should be disposed, in our English idiom, to employ the proper name: "<span class="accented">And</span> it came to pass at midnight that ' Boaz' started in a fright." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-13 What in one age or nation would be improper, is not always so in another age or another nation. Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tell Ruth what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption, and what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order to accomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct of Boaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantage of Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, nor suspect her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as a virtuous woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived, sent her away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made his promise conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whom the right of redemption belonged.</body></html>
