But every side of its import brings into view one or other or more of such affiliated ideas as <span class="accented">strength</span>, <span class="accented">force</span>, <span class="accented">forces</span>, <span class="accented">capability</span> - whether mental and moral only, or also financial; <span class="accented">competency</span>, <span class="accented">substantiality</span>, <span class="accented">ability</span>, <span class="accented">bravery</span>. All who had taken notice of Ruth perceived that she was mentally and morally, as well as physically, a <span class="accented">substantial</span> and <span class="accented">capable</span> woman. She was possessed of <span class="accented">force</span>, both of mind and character. She was, in the New England sense, of the expression, <span class="accented">a woman</span> of "faculty. She was <span class="accented">full of resources</span>, and thus adequate to the position which, as Boaz's wife, she would be required to fill. There was no levity about her, "no nonsense." She was earnest, industrious, virtuous, strenuous, brave. There was much of <span class="accented">the heroine in</span> her character, and thus the expression connects itself with the masculine application of the distinctive and many-sided word, "<span class="accented">a</span> mighty man of <span class="accented">valor</span>." The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>, where, in King James's version, it is, as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>, translated 'Ca virtuous woman" - "a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband." But it is not so much to moral <span class="accented">virtue</span> that there is a reference as to that general capacity which consists in "<span class="accented">large</span> discourse, looking before and after" ('Hamlet, ' 4:4). Compare the masculine expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21, 25</a>, rendered, in King-James's version, "able men," and meaning <span class="accented">capable</span> or <span class="accented">substantial men</span>, who, however, as we learn from the additional characteristics that are specified, were to be likewise conspicuous for high moral worth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a> there is the same reference to <span class="accented">general capacity</span>, as is evidenced by the graphic representation that follows - a representation that by no means exhausts itself in the idea of <span class="accented">moral virtue</span>. Ibn Ezra takes the whole soul out of the expression when he interprets it, both here and in Proverbs, as meaning "<span class="accented">a</span> woman possessed of riches." When Boaz says, "All that thou sayest I will do to thee," he means, "All that thou hast so winsomely and yet so modestly referred to in what thou didst say, I am prepared to do to thee. There was only one obstacle in the way, and that of a somewhat technical description. If that should be honorably surmounted, nothing would be more agreeable to Boaz s heart than to get nearer to Ruth "For," said he, "it is on all hands known in the gate of my people that," etc. Literally the phrase is, "for all the gate of my people know," a strange inverted but picturesque mode of expression. It was not "the gate of the people," but the people of the gate," that knew. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-13 What in one age or nation would be improper, is not always so in another age or another nation. Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tell Ruth what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption, and what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order to accomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct of Boaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantage of Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, nor suspect her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as a virtuous woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived, sent her away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made his promise conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whom the right of redemption belonged.</body></html>
