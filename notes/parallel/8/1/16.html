The intensity of her feeling comes out all the more strongly now that she pleads alone: "I will undertake with thee the toilsome journey, I will lodge with thee however hardly, I will venture among a strange people, and will worship a new god."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ruth said, Insist not on me forsaking thee: for whither thou goest, I will go.</span> Ruth's mind was made up. Her heart would not be wrenched away from her mother-in-law. The length of the journey, its dangers, and the inevitable fatigue accompanying it, moved not, by so much as a jot, her resolution. Had not her mother-in-law the same distance to travel, the same fatigue to endure, the same perils to encounter? Might not the aged traveler, moreover, derive some assistance and cheer from the company of a young, ready-handed, and willing-hearted companion? She was resolved. Nothing on earth would separate them. <span class="cmt_word">Wheresoever thou lodgest, I will lodge</span>. A better version than Luther's, "Where thou stayest, I will stay" (<span class="accented">wo du bleibest</span>, <span class="accented">da bleibe ich auch</span>). The reference is not to the ultimate destination, but to the nightly halts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> is the verb employed; and it is rendered "to tarry all night" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-54.htm">Genesis 24:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-6.htm">Judges 19:6</a>, etc. It is the Latin <span class="accented">pernoetare</span> and the German <span class="accented">ubernachten</span>, the former being the rendering of the Vulgate, and the latter the translation in the <span class="accented">Berlenburger Bibel</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy people (is) my people, and thy God my God.</span> There being no verb in the original, it is well to supply the simplest copula. Ruth claims, as it were, Naomi's people and Naomi's God as her own already. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 See Ruth's resolution, and her good affection to Naomi. Orpah was loth to part from her; yet she did not love her well enough to leave Moab for her sake. Thus, many have a value and affection for Christ, yet come short of salvation by him, because they will not forsake other things for him. They love him, yet leave him, because they do not love him enough, but love other things better. Ruth is an example of the grace of God, inclining the soul to choose the better part. Naomi could desire no more than the solemn declaration Ruth made. See the power of resolution; it silences temptation. Those that go in religious ways without a stedfast mind, stand like a door half open, which invites a thief; but resolution shuts and bolts the door, resists the devil and forces him to flee.</body></html>
