It was thus that the Hebrews made their most awful appeals to Yahveh. They signified their willingness to suffer some dire calamity if they should either do the evil deed repudiated or fail to do the good deed promised. So stands in misty indefiniteness; not, as Fuller supposes, by way of "leaving it to the discretion of God Almighty to choose that arrow out of his quiver which he shall think it most fit to shoot," but as a kind of euphemism, or cloudy veil, two-thirds concealing, and one-third revealing, whatever horrid infliction could by dramatic sign be represented or hinted. <span class="accented">And still more - a</span> thoroughly Semitic idiom, <span class="accented">and so may he add</span> (<span class="accented">to do</span>) There was first of all a full imprecation, and then an additional 'bittock,' to lend intensity to the asseveration. "<span class="accented">But</span> death only shall sever between me and thee!" Ruth's language is broken. Two formulas of imprecation are flung together. One, if complete, would have been to this effect: "So may Yahveh do to me, and so may he add to do, if (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) aught but death sever between me and thee!" The other, if complete, would have run thus: "<span class="accented">I</span> swear by Yahveh 'that' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) death, death only, shall part thee and me. In the original the word <span class="accented">death</span> has the article, <span class="accented">death emphatically</span>. It is as if she had said <span class="accented">death</span>, <span class="accented">the great divider</span>. The full idea is in substance <span class="accented">death alone</span>. This divider alone, says Ruth, "<span class="accented">shall</span> sever between me and thee;" literally, "<span class="accented">between</span> me and between thee," a Hebrew idiom, repeating for emphasis' sake the two-sided relationship, but taking the repetition in reverse order, <span class="accented">between me</span> (<span class="accented">and thee</span>) and <span class="accented">between thee</span> (<span class="accented">and me</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 See Ruth's resolution, and her good affection to Naomi. Orpah was loth to part from her; yet she did not love her well enough to leave Moab for her sake. Thus, many have a value and affection for Christ, yet come short of salvation by him, because they will not forsake other things for him. They love him, yet leave him, because they do not love him enough, but love other things better. Ruth is an example of the grace of God, inclining the soul to choose the better part. Naomi could desire no more than the solemn declaration Ruth made. See the power of resolution; it silences temptation. Those that go in religious ways without a stedfast mind, stand like a door half open, which invites a thief; but resolution shuts and bolts the door, resists the devil and forces him to flee.</body></html>
