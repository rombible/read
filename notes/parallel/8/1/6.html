The phrase in the original is simply "and she returned," that is, "and she began to return." <span class="cmt_word">From the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.</span> Or, more literally, "<span class="accented">for</span> she heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah" - or, rather, "Yahveh," or, as Epiphanius gives it, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;</span> - "<span class="accented">had</span> visited his people to give them bread." There is no warrant, however, and no need, to add, with the Chaldee Targumist, that the news was conveyed <span class="accented">by the mouth of an angel</span>. And the representation is not that Yahveh, in giving, bread to his people, had thereby visited them; it is that he hid visited them" to give them bread. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, rendered <span class="accented">visited</span>, is quite peculiar, with no analogue in English, German, Greek, or Latin. Yahveh had <span class="accented">directed his attention</span> to his people, and had, so to speak, <span class="accented">made inquisition into their state</span>, and had hence taken steps to give them bread (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>). They had already got it, or, as the Septuagint translates, they had got <span class="accented">loaves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Vulgate translates it <span class="accented">meats</span> (eseas). It is assumed in the tidings that the seasons and their products, and all beneficent influences in nature, belong to Yahveh. It is likewise assumed that the Hebrews were his people, albeit not in such a sense as to secure for them more "bread" and "milk and honey" than other peoples enjoyed. Their chief prerogatives were spiritual and moral. <span class="accented">They were his Messianic people</span>. That is the key to unlock the secret of the whole Old Testament Scriptures. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 Naomi began to think of returning, after the death of her two sons. When death comes into a family, it ought to reform what is amiss there. Earth is made bitter to us, that heaven may be made dear. Naomi seems to have been a person of faith and piety. She dismissed her daughters-in-law with prayer. It is very proper for friends, when they part, to part with them thus part in love. Did Naomi do well, to discourage her daughters from going with her, when she might save them from the idolatry of Moab, and bring them to the faith and worship of the God of Israel? Naomi, no doubt, desired to do that; but if they went with her, she would not have them to go upon her account. Those that take upon them a profession of religion only to oblige their friends, or for the sake of company, will be converts of small value. If they did come with her, she would have them make it their deliberate choice, and sit down first and count the cost, as it concerns those to do who make a profession of religion. And more desire rest in the house of a husband, or some wordly settlement or earthly satisfaction, than the rest to which Christ invites our souls; therefore when tried they will depart from Christ, though perhaps with some sorrow.</body></html>
