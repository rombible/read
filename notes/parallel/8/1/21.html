Why should you call me Naomi, and Yahveh has testified against me, and the Almighty has brought evil upon me?</span> She went forth "full," with husband and sons, not to speak of goods. She was under the necessity of returning <span class="accented">in emptiness</span>, or <span class="accented">with empty</span> hands. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> does not exactly mean <span class="accented">empty</span>, as it is rendered in the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and King James's version. It is not an adjective, but an adverb, <span class="accented">emptily</span>. This lamentable change of circumstances she attributed to the action of Yahveh. He had, she believed, been testifying against her by means of the trials through which she had passed. She was right in a certain conditional acceptation of her language; but only on <span class="accented">condition of that condition</span>. And, let us condition her declarations as we may, she was probably in danger of making the same mistake concerning herself and her trials which was made by Job's comforters in reference to the calamities by which he was overwhelmed. In so far as <span class="accented">penal evil is</span> concerned, it may be traced directly or circuitously to the will and government of God. "<span class="accented">Shall</span> there be <span class="accented">evil -</span> that is, penal evil - in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). But <span class="accented">there are many sufferings that are not penal</span>. The evil that is penal is only one segment of physical evil; and then there is besides, metaphysical evil, or the evil that consists in the inevitable imperfection of finite being. It is noteworthy that the participle of the Hiphilic verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> employed by Naomi is always translated in King James s version <span class="accented">evil doer</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked doer</span>, or <span class="accented">evil</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked</span>, Naomi, in using such a term, and applying it to Yahveh, was walking on a theological precipice, where it is not needful that we should accompany her. Instead of the literal expression, '<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>, we may, with our English wealth of conjunctions freely say, '<span class="accented">when</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>. There is a charm in the original simplicity. There is likewise a charm in the more complex structure of the free translation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-22 Naomi and Ruth came to Bethlehem. Afflictions will make great and surprising changes in a little time. May God, by his grace, fit us for all such changes, especially the great change!, Naomi signifies pleasant, or amiable; Mara, bitter, or bitterness. She was now a woman of a sorrowful spirit. She had come home empty, poor, a widow and childless. But there is a fulness for believers of which they never can be emptied; a good part which shall not be taken from those who have it. The cup of affliction is a bitter cup, but she owns that the affliction came from God. It well becomes us to have our hearts humbled under humbling providences. It is not affliction itself, but affliction rightly borne, that does us good.</body></html>
