Mahlon and Chilion mean <span class= "ital">sickness </span>and <span class= "ital">wasting, </span>it may be in reference to their premature death, the names being given by reason of their feeble health. It is not certain which was the elder: Mahlon is mentioned first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm" title="And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah.

Ephrath was the old name of Bethlehem. Why, in the present passage, the town is called Bethlehem-judah, and the inhabitants Ephrathites, does not appear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the man was Elimelech.</span> That is, "God is King," not, as the older critics were accustomed to interpret it, "My God is King." The intermediate i is not the possessive pronoun, but the vowel of union. The name would be originally significant of strong religious Sentiments, perhaps mingled with strong political principles. The imposition of it on a son would be something like a manifesto of the father's creed. <span class="cmt_word">And the name of his wife Naomi.</span> Or rather "No-o-mi." The precise import of the word is not absolutely ascertained; but it is probable that it is somewhat abbreviated in its terraination, and means "God is sweet," or, very literally, "Jab is sweetness." It had been originally imposed as a name by some grateful and happy mother, who, by gracious providences, or by other gracious revelations, had been led to think that "sweet are the ways, sweet are the dealings, and sweet is the character of God." The word does not mean <span class="accented">beautiful</span>, as some suppose; nor <span class="accented">gracious</span>, as others suppose; nor <span class="accented">my delight</span>, as others still suppose. It was not intended to describe the character of the person who was to bear the name. It was intended to signalize, in the spirit of a manifesto, a much-prized feature in the Divine character - that feature, namely, that is displayed when "he deals sweetly with men." Gesenius is doubtless right when he makes <span class="accented">sweetness</span> the fundamental idea of the whole group of affiliated words (see his 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in voc</span>.). The cognate Hebrew adjective is rendered <span class="accented">sweet</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-8.htm">Proverbs 23:8</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a> and the margin of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). In the light of this interpretation, and of it alone, can the full significance of what Naomi said on her return to Bethlehem be apprehended: "Call me not Naomi, call me <span class="accented">Mara</span>: for <span class="accented">the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly</span> with me" (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">And the name of his two sons.</span> In our idiom we should say, "and the names of his two sons." The two sons, however, were for the moment regarded as a unity among the other units of the household. <span class="cmt_word">Mahlon</span>, or rather "Machlon," <span class="cmt_word">and Chillon.</span> We need not dip deeply into the etymological import of these names, or attach to them, as applied to Elimelech's children, any peculiar significance. The names, unlike those of the parents, are devoid of theological tinge, and, in these modern times at all events, their import is liable to endless debate. One would at the first blush of consideration suppose that the one meant <span class="accented">sickliness</span>, and the other <span class="accented">consumptiveness</span>, or <span class="accented">consumption -</span> rather uninteresting and melancholy ideas. But they are peculiarly confounding when we consider that the individuals, so named in our story, had apparently inherited a delicate constitution, which developed in both of them into premature <span class="accented">sickliness and decay</span>. The names have the aspect of being prophetic. And yet, even though we should assume that Elimelech, in virtue of some element of bodily delicacy, was afflicted with feelings of morbid despondency, it is hard to come to the conclusion that he would deliberately stereotype his most hypochondriacal anticipations in the names of his children. The probability is, that the names, as names, would originally have some other import, Dr. Cassel supposes that they meant, respectively, <span class="accented">joy</span> and <span class="accented">ornament</span>; but he trusts to impossible etymologies. Raabe, taking his cue from Sanskrit roots, interprets the one thus "He who brings gifts with him;" and the other thus - "He who conceals his wife in his house." Warner, taking his cue from Chaldea cognates, interprets the former of the two names as meaning <span class="accented">ready to forgive</span>, and the latter as holding forth the idea of <span class="accented">hopeful</span>. All of them unlikely derivations. And yet something quite distinct from the ideas of <span class="accented">sickliness</span> and <span class="accented">consumption</span>, but lying so far on parallel lines of thought, may be conceived. The primary import of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, the root of <span class="accented">Machlon</span>, is apparently <span class="accented">to be tender</span>. Thence the word came by one line of thought to mean <span class="accented">to be physically tender</span>, that is, <span class="accented">to be sick</span>; and by another that runs out in Chaldea it came to mean <span class="accented">to be morally teenier</span>, <span class="accented">to be mild or forgiving</span>. Machlon may mean <span class="accented">mildness</span> or <span class="accented">tender-heartedness</span>. Again, the primary idea of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the root of Chillon, is <span class="accented">to complete</span>. But, besides the completion that is realized in <span class="accented">consuming</span>, <span class="accented">consumption</span>, or <span class="accented">ending</span>, there is moral <span class="accented">completeness</span>, the <span class="accented">completeness</span> or <span class="accented">finish</span> that is realized in <span class="accented">perfection</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-96.htm">Psalm 119:96</a>: "I have seen an end of all <span class="accented">perfection"</span>). This idea of <span class="accented">beautiful completeness</span>, <span class="accented">or perfection</span>, is more likely to be the meaning of the name than the idea of <span class="accented">consumptiveness</span>, or <span class="accented">consumption</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Ephrathitas of Bethlehem Judah.</span> It is not simply the two sons who are so designated. It is the whole group. They were Ephrathites, that is, Bethlehemites, for the old name of Bethlehem was Ephrath, or Ephratha. As, however, the word Ephrathite also meant Ephraimite (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>), it gave precision to the designation, although at the expense of a little redundancy, to say "Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah." <span class="cmt_word">And they came into the country of Moab.</span> The Hebrew emigrants reached the <span class="accented">fields</span> or <span class="accented">pastoral terrgtory</span> of Moab. <span class="cmt_word">And continued there.</span> The phrase in the original is of primitive simplicity - "and were there." It has been asked by theological critics whether Elimelech was justifiable in removing to an "<span class="accented">idolatrous</span> country" to avoid the inconveniences of a famine in the land of his nativity. It is enough to say in reply that there is no hint in the text itself that the step taken was blamable or blamed. "<span class="accented">No</span> man ought," says Lawson, "to be condemned, whether dead or alive, without proofs of guilt; and no certain proofs of guilt appear in the present case." "<span class="accented">The</span> beam of Elimelech's judgment," says Dr. Thomas Fuller, "is <span class="accented">justly</span> weighed down to <span class="accented">go</span> from Bethlehem, Judah, into the land of Moab." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Elimelech's care to provide for his family, was not to be blamed; but his removal into the country of Moab could not be justified. And the removal ended in the wasting of his family. It is folly to think of escaping that cross, which, being laid in our way, we ought to take up. Changing our place seldom is mending it. Those who bring young people into bad acquaintance, and take them out of the way of public ordinances, thought they may think them well-principled, and armed against temptation, know not what will be the end. It does not appear that the women the sons of Elimelech married, were proselyted to the Jewish religion. Earthly trials or enjoyments are of short continuance. Death continually removes those of every age and situation, and mars all our outward comforts: we cannot too strongly prefer those advantages which shall last for ever.</body></html>
