As a set off to this apparent harshness towards the man who had been thus treated, we must read <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/56-3.htm" title="Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD has utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.">Isaiah 56:3-4</a>, in which a special promise is given to the eunuchs that keep God's Sabbaths and take hold of His covenant. God will give to them <span class= "ital">within His house and within His walls </span>"<span class= "ital">a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters</span>--an everlasting name that shall not be cut off." As a special calamity it was foretold to Hezekiah that some of his descendants should be eunuchs in the palace of the King of Babylon. But Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in whom this prophecy was fulfilled, have ennobled the "children that are of their sort" for evermore.<p>We have no means of knowing whether the eunuchs that were in the service of the kings of Israel or Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-15.htm" title="And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.">1Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-9.htm" title="Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten here Micaiah the son of Imlah.">1Kings 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-6.htm" title="And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.">2Kings 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-32.htm" title="And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.">2Kings 9:32</a>, &c.) were Israelites by birth or not. Ebedmelech, <span class= "ital">the Ethiopian, </span>who received a special blessing from Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/39-15.htm" title="Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,">Jeremiah 39:15-18</a>), was a foreigner, and so very possibly were most, if not all, of his kind in Israel.<p>As to the second clause of this verse, it must be remembered that circumcision was the sign of the covenant of Jehovah; mutilation a form of heathen self-devotion. (See Gal. 5, 12, Revised New Testament, Margin, and Bishop Lightfoot's comment on that place.) St. Paul's words in Galatians receive a double meaning from this law. By doing what he refers to, they would cut themselves off from the congregation of the Lord. Rashi also gives another meaning, which would connect the precept with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When any man has a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.">Leviticus 15:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Mutilation was performed by the two methods here specified - crushing and excision. The exclusion of persons who had suffered this from the congregation, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from the covenant fellowship of Israel, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>), was due to the priestly character of the nation. Israel was a kingdom of priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), and the admission into it of one in whom the nature of man, as made by God, had been degraded and marred, would have been unfitting; just as all bodily blemish unfitted a man for being a priest, though otherwise qualified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-16.htm">Leviticus 21:16-24</a>). This law, however, was one of the ordinances intended for the period of nonage; it had reference to the outward typical aspect of the Israelitish constitution; and it ceased to have any significance when the spiritual kingdom of God came to be established. Even under the theocracy, eunuchs were not excluded from religious privileges; they could keep God's Sabbaths, and take hold of his covenant, and choose the things pleasing to him, and so be part of the spiritual Israel, though shut out from the fellowship of that which was outward and national (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-4.htm">Isaiah 56:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-8 We ought to value the privileges of God's people, both for ourselves and for our children, above all other advantages. No personal blemishes, no crimes of our forefathers, no difference of nation, shuts us out under the Christian dispensation. But an unsound heart will deprive us of blessings; and a bad example, or an unsuitable marriage, may shut our children from them.</body></html>
