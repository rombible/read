The reference is to a foreign slave who had fled from the harsh treatment of his master to seek refuge in Israel, as is evident from the expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>, "in one of thy gates," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">in</span> any part of thy land.

His master; the word used is the plural <span class="accented">adonim</span>, masters. The use of this for a human master or lord is peculiar to the Pentateuch (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-9.htm">Genesis 24:9, 51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-1.htm">Genesis 40:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-4.htm">Exodus 21:4, 6, 32</a>, etc.). In this use of the term there is no reference to severity of rule, as if this were a plural intensive. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-25 It is honourable to shelter and protect the weak, provided they are not wicked. Proselytes and converts to the truth, should be treated with particular tenderness, that they may have no temptation to return to the world. We cannot honour God with our substance, unless it be honestly and honourably come by. It must not only be considered what we give, but how we got it. Where the borrower gets, or hopes to get, it is just that the lender should share the gain; but to him that borrows for necessary food, pity must be showed. That which is gone out of thy lips, as a solemn and deliberate vow, must not be recalled, but thou shalt keep and perform it punctually and fully. They were allowed to pluck and eat of the corn or grapes that grew by the road side; only they must not carry any away. This law intimated what great plenty of corn and wine they should have in Canaan. It provided for the support of poor travellers, and teaches us to be kind to such, teaches us to be ready to distribute, and not to think every thing lost that is given away. Yet it forbids us to abuse the kindness of friends, or to take advantage of what is allowed. Faithfulness to their engagements should mark the people of God; and they should never encroach upon others.</body></html>
