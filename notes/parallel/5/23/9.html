The entire passage is continuous from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-9.htm" title="When the host goes forth against your enemies, then keep you from every wicked thing.">Deuteronomy 23:9</a>. Hence the whole discussion raised, after the appearance of Dr. Colenso's work, on the size of the camp of Israel and the possibility of obeying this rule, was simply waste of words, and arose out of a misunderstanding of the matter under consideration. The sanitary value of the rule has been abundantly demonstrated in our own day.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">A paddle</span>--rather, a pin, or spike, like that with which Jael slew Sisera. The word for "weapon" does not occur elsewhere. The LXX. translates it <span class= "ital">"</span>a pin or tent-peg <span class= "ital">at thy girdle;" </span>the Hebrew word (<span class= "ital">azen</span>) being like the Greek (<span class= "greekheb">????</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>But both Targums interpret the word as "weapon," connecting it with the Hebrew <span class= "ital">zayin, </span>which has that meaning. The <span class= "ital">hinder end of the spear </span>in Abner's hand was sharp enough to strike Asahel a fatal blow when he followed him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm" title="However, he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.">2Samuel 2:23</a>). Saul's spear also was "stuck in the ground at his bolster" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-7.htm" title="So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.">1Samuel 26:7</a>), probably with its point upwards, by the same spike.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of . . . thee.</span>--A most beautiful argument for purity in every sense. It was evidently present to St. Paul's mind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2Corinthians 6:16</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2Corinthians 7:1</a>, "God hath said, I will dwell in them, and <span class= "ital">walk in them. . . . </span>Having therefore these promises . . . let us <span class= "ital">cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, </span>perfecting holiness in the fear of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:9-14 The camp of the Lord must have nothing offensive in it.
