Some recent writers on this law have thought that it forbids the putting out of money to interest. But it is noticeable that in both the previous passages referred to (in Exod. and Lev.) the loan is supposed to be made to a "poor man" in "real distress." Usury in such cases means oppression; and so it is proved to be by the examples given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/5-2.htm" title="For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.">Nehemiah 5:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/5-10.htm" title="I likewise, and my brothers, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.">Nehemiah 5:10-12</a>. The connection between this exaction and modern investments is not obvious, except in a very few cases. The Mosaic law against usury does not belong to commerce with other nations; it is part of the poor law of the land of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-25.</span> - Certain civil rights and duties are here prescribed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - An Israelite might lend on interest money, or victuals, or other property, to a foreigner, but of one of his own people he was not to take interest for a loan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36, 37</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-25 It is honourable to shelter and protect the weak, provided they are not wicked. Proselytes and converts to the truth, should be treated with particular tenderness, that they may have no temptation to return to the world. We cannot honour God with our substance, unless it be honestly and honourably come by. It must not only be considered what we give, but how we got it. Where the borrower gets, or hopes to get, it is just that the lender should share the gain; but to him that borrows for necessary food, pity must be showed. That which is gone out of thy lips, as a solemn and deliberate vow, must not be recalled, but thou shalt keep and perform it punctually and fully. They were allowed to pluck and eat of the corn or grapes that grew by the road side; only they must not carry any away. This law intimated what great plenty of corn and wine they should have in Canaan. It provided for the support of poor travellers, and teaches us to be kind to such, teaches us to be ready to distribute, and not to think every thing lost that is given away. Yet it forbids us to abuse the kindness of friends, or to take advantage of what is allowed. Faithfulness to their engagements should mark the people of God; and they should never encroach upon others.</body></html>
