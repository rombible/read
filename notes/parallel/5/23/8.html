It seems to have been impossible to prevent some inter-marriages between Edom, Moab, and Israel when the Israelites passed through their land. Such a precept is suitable to the circumstances of Moses' time. It would be less necessary when the bulk of the people had gone over the Jordan and left Moab and Edom far behind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-8 We ought to value the privileges of God's people, both for ourselves and for our children, above all other advantages.
