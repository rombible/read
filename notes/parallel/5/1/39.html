The Hebrews were wont to express totality or universality by specifying contradictory opposites, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, great and small (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-30.htm">2 Chronicles 34:30</a>), master and scholar (Malachi 2:20), free and bond (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>), shut up and left (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>, where see note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>), etc. Accordingly, when <span class="accented">good and evil</span> are set over against each other, the notion of entireness or universality is expressed. Thus, when Laban and Bethuel said to Abraham's servant "We cannot speak unto thee bad or good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>), the meaning is, We can say nothing at all. Absalom spake to Amnon "neither good nor bad" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-22.htm">2 Samuel 13:22</a>); that is, he did not say anything to him. The woman of Tekoa said to David, "As an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-17.htm">2 Samuel 14:17</a>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. There is nothing the king does not know - his knowledge is universal. Hence to know good and evil came to mean to be intelligent, and not to know good and evil to be unintelligent, as is a babe. The children here referred to knew nothing, and consequently could not be held as morally responsible; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>; Homer, ' Odyssey,' 18:228 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x1fb6;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-46 Moses reminds the Israelites of their march from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea, through that great and terrible wilderness. He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.</body></html>
