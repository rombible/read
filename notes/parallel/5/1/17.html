For the latter part of this verse comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/18-22.htm" title="And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.">Exodus 18:22-26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not respect persons</span>; literally, <span class="accented">look at</span> or <span class="accented">regard aces</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. ye shall not deal partially, favoring the one party rather than the other (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>); the small as well as the great were to be heard, and neither for favor nor from fear were they to pervert justice. <span class="cmt_word">The judgment is God's</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. appointed by God and administered in his name, the judge acting for God and by his authority, and being answerable to him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6</a>). Hence the phrases, "to inquire of God," "to bring before God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-8.htm">Exodus 22:8</a>, etc.) phrases still in use among the Arabs for a summoning to judicial trial. In the case of a matter coming before the judges which they found it beyond their power to decide, they were to bring it before Moses as a superior authority (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-26.htm">Exodus 18:26</a>) "Some think there were certain causes reserved to the cognizance of Moses; but the contrary appears by these words, that all manner of causes were brought before the judges; and they, not the people, brought such causes before Moses as they found too hard for them to determine. So that they, not the person whose cause it was, judged of the difficulty of the cause. See Selden, lib. 1. "De Synedriis, cap. 16." (Bishop Patrick). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-18 Moses reminds the people of the happy constitution of their government, which might make them all safe and easy, if it was not their own fault. He owns the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham, and prays for the further accomplishment of it. We are not straitened in the power and goodness of God; why should we be straitened in our own faith and hope? Good laws were given to the Israelites, and good men were to see to the execution of them, which showed God's goodness to them, and the care of Moses.</body></html>
