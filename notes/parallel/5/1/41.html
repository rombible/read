Their confession, however, was in word only; their conduct showed that it was not sincere. In Numbers (Numbers 14:44) it is said, "They presumed to go up;" here it is said (ver. Numbers 14:41), <span class="cmt_word">Ye were ready to go up</span>, rather, <span class="accented">ye acted heedlessly with levity</span>, or <span class="accented">rive</span>. <span class="accented">lonely</span>, <span class="accented">to go up</span>. The verb here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) occurs only in this place, and is of doubtful signification. The Rabbins compare it with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span>, lo we! here we be! of the people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40</a>. It is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, which is supposed to be the same as the Arabic , to be light, easy; and from, this the meaning, "ye went up heedlessly, is deduced. None of the ancient versions, however, give this meaning. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">instructi armis pergeretis in montem</span>; Onk., <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5e1;&#x5e7;</span> (and ye began to ascend); Syriac, (and ye incited yourselves to go up). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-46 Moses reminds the Israelites of their march from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea, through that great and terrible wilderness. He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.</body></html>
