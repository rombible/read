The mountain range of the Amorites, afterwards called the hill country of Judah and Ephraim, was the object which would first strike the view of one advancing from the south; and so, it stands here for the whole land of Canaan, with which it is in this context identified. Those "that dwell thereon" are the inhabitants of the whole of Canaan. The Amorites (Hebrew <span class="accented">Emori</span>, so called from Amor, or Emor) oftener than once appear as standing for the Canaanites generally (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20, 21</a>, etc.). That all the inhabitants of Canaan are intended here is evident from the specification of the different districts of the land of Canaan which immediately follows. <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>: the '<span class="accented">Arabah</span> (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">In the hills</span>: the hill country of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the vale</span>: the <span class="accented">shephelah</span>, or lowland, the country lying between the mountain range of Judah and the Mediterranean Sea, and stretching northwards from the parallel of Gaza to that of Carmel. <span class="cmt_word">In the south</span>: the <span class="accented">negeb</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> southland (literally, <span class="accented">dryness</span>), the district which formed the transition from the desert to the cultivated land, extending from the south of the Dead Sea westwards to Gaza, a vast steppe or prairie, for the most part pasture land. The seashore: the narrow strip of land on the coast of the Mediterranean from <span class="accented">Joppa to</span> Tyre (in the New Testament, "the coast of Tyre and Sidon," <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Canaanites</span>: the whole country of which these were the separate parts. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Lebanon</span>: the <span class="accented">Whale Mountain</span>, so called, probably, from the snow which rests on its summit. <span class="cmt_word">The great river, the river Euphrates</span>. The Phrath, or Euphrates, which has its sources in the mountains of Armenia, and in its course divides Armenia from Cappadocia, formed the eastern limit of the territory promised by God to Abraham. The epithet "great" seems to have been commonly applied to it. Callimachus calls it '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3a3;&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ('In Apoll.,' 107), and Lucan has- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quaque caput rapido tollit cum Tigride<br />magnus Euphrates."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Phars.,' 3:256.</span>) As by much the most considerable river of western Asia, the Euphrates was known <span class="accented">as</span> "the river" <span class="accented">par</span> <span class="accented">excellence</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>). The mention of Lebanon and the Euphrates is not, as Keil <span class="accented">suggests</span>, "to be attributed to the rhetorical fullness of the style;" but is due to the fact that these were included in what God promised to Abraham and his seed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Moses spake to the people all the Lord had given him in commandment. Horeb was but eleven days distant from Kadesh-barnea. This was to remind them that their own bad conduct had occasioned their tedious wanderings; that they might the more readily understand the advantages of obedience. They must now go forward. Though God brings his people into trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried long enough. When God commands us to go forward in our Christian course, he sets the heavenly Canaan before us for our encouragement.</body></html>
