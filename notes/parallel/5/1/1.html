Strictly speaking, the words "in the wilderness" cannot be connected with what follows, for "the plain" described is on neither side of Jordan, but below the southern end of the Dead Sea.<p><span class= "bld">In the plain</span>--i.e., the <span class= "ital">'Arabah. </span>Usually the plain of Jordan; here the valley that extends from the lower end of the Dead Sea to the head of the Gulf of Akabah.<p><span class= "bld">Over against the Red Sea.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">opposite S-ph. </span>In all other places in the Old Testament, when we read of the Red Sea, it is <span class= "ital">Yam S-ph. </span>Here we have <span class= "ital">Suph </span>only. On these grounds some take it as the name of a place. (Comp. Vaheb in S-phah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm" title="Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,">Numbers 21:14</a>, margin.) But we do not know the place; and as the Jewish paraphrasts and commentators find no difficulty in accepting Suph by itself as the sea, we may take it of the Gulf of Akabah. The plain between Paran and Tophel looks straight down to that gulf.<p><span class= "bld">Between Paran, and Tophel . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">between Paran, and between Tophel and Laban, &c.: </span>that is, <span class= "ital">between Paran on the one side, and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab on the other. </span>This is the literal meaning, and it suits the geography so far as the places are yet identified. The small map at p. 239 of Conder's <span class= "ital">Handbook to the Bible </span>shows the desert of Paran stretching northward from Sinai on the left, and on the right, Tophel and Hazeroth (the only other places identified among these five) at the two extremities of a line drawn from the southeast end of the Dead Sea in the direction of Sinai. Tophel is taken as Tufileh, and Hazeroth is 'Ain Hadra. Laban must be some "white" place lying between, probably named from the colour of the rocks in its neighbourhood. Dizahab should be nearer Sinai than Hazeroth. The Jewish commentators, from its meaning, "gold enough," connected it with the golden calf. And it is not inconceivable that the place where that object of idolatry was "burned with fire," and "stamped" and "ground very small," till it was as "small as dust," and "cast into the brook that descended out of the mount" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm" title="And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>), was called "gold enough" from the apparent waste of the precious metal that took place there; possibly also because Moses made the children of Israel drink of the water. They had enough of that golden calf before they had done with it. If this view of the geography of this verse be correct, it defines with considerable clearness the line of march from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea. It lies between the mountains on the edge of the wilderness of Paran upon the west, and the Gulf of Akabah on the east, until that gulf is left behind by the traveller going northward. It then enters the desert of Zin, called here the plain, or 'Arabah. This desert is bounded by ranges of mountains on both sides, and looks down to the Gulf of Akabah. Behind the western range we still have the wilderness of Paran. On the east are the mountains of Edom, which Israel first had on their right in the march to Kadesh-barnea, and then on their left in a later journey, in the last year of the exodus, when they compassed the land of Edom. Tophel lies on the east of this range, just before the route becomes level with the southern end of the Dead Sea.<p>But the whole of the route between Paran on the left and those other five places on the right belongs to Israel's first march from Sinai to Kadesh. It takes them up the desert of Zin, and, so far as these two verses are concerned, it keeps them there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These be the words.</span> Some would render here "Such are the words," and understand the expression as referring to the preceding books. But it seems more natural to refer it to what follows - to the addresses in this book. The pronoun these (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) may be used with a prospective reference, as well as with a retrospective (cf. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>). The author does not by this connect this book with the preceding, but rather distinguishes it. The subscription to Numbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-13.htm">Numbers 36:13</a>) indicates that what precedes is occupied chiefly with what God spake to Moses; the inscription here intimates that what follows is what Moses spake to the people. This is the characteristic of Deuteronomy. <span class="cmt_word">Unto all Israel.</span> It cannot be supposed that Moses spoke to the whole multitude of the people so as to be heard by them. Hence the Jewish interpreters say that he spoke to the elders of the people, who carried his words to the people at large. This is just; for what was thus mediately communicated to the people might be fairly described as spoken to them; and we find from other passages in the Pentateuch that the phrase, "the elders of Israel," in the mind of the writer, was equivalent to "the congregation of Israel" (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a> with ver. 21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a> with ver. 5). But through whatever medium conveyed, it was to the people that these words were addressed; this is emphatically a book for the people. <span class="cmt_word">On this side Jordan.</span> This should be <span class="accented">On the other side</span> or <span class="accented">beyond Jordan</span>, and so also in ver. 5, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20, 25</a>. The word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) means properly something beyond, over, or across, and indicates that which, to the speaker, lies on the <span class="accented">other</span> side of some line or limit. When coupled with "the Jordan," it usually indicates the region to the <span class="accented">east</span> of that river; only in one or two instances, where the speaker takes his standpoint on the east of the river, does it designate the regions to the west of Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-25.htm">Deuteronomy 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>) The phrase "beyond Jordan" seems to have been the established designation of the region east of the Jordan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a>, and Canon Rawlinson's note there). It is this, unquestionably, which is here so designated, as what follows expressly shows. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness.</span> This term is used of any extensive district not occupied by inhabitants or subjected to culture; hence of vast prairies or pasturelands, as well as of places properly desert and desolate. It here denotes the grassy plains or downs on the east and southeast of the Jordan, in the land of Moab (ver. 5). <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>; in the Arabah. This is properly the whole of that remarkable depression which stretches from the source of the Jordan on to Akabah, or the Ailanitic Gulf; but here it is only that part of it which extends from the south end of the Dead Sea to Allah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>). This part still bears the name of the 'Arabah, the northern part being known as the Ghor (Smith's 'Dictionary,' vol. 1. p. 87; Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' vol. 1. p. 178). <span class="cmt_word">Over against the Red sea.</span> The name by which the Red Sea is elsewhere designated is <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span>); here only the latter word occurs, and this has led some to doubt if the Red Sea be here intended. Patrick, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others suggest that <span class="accented">Suph</span> denotes some place in that region, probably Suphah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>, margin, Authorized Version), <span class="accented">so</span> called because lying at its extremity, as the verb <span class="accented">suph</span>, from which it comes, means, to come to an end; but it is not certain that Suphah designates a place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;</span> means a tempest or whirlwind; and this meaning may be assumed here, as it is by Gesenius, Keil, and others: "Waheb [he conquered] in a storm." Knobel suggests that probably the pass now called Es Sufah, on the north side of the Wady Murreh - the Maleh-acrabbim (Scorpion-ascent) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a> - is meant; others have suggested Zephath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), and others Zuph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>). It is probable, however, that <span class="accented">Suph</span> is here merely a breviloquence for <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span>, the Red Sea; and so all the ancient versions take it. The identification of the <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span> of the Old Testament with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> of the Greeks, the <span class="accented">mare erythraeum</span>, or <span class="accented">rubrum</span>, of the Latins, is due to the LXX., which other versions have followed. The identification is undoubtedly correct (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-10.htm">Numbers 33:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>). <span class="accented">Yam-suph</span>, indeed, means simply sea of weeds, and might be the name of any sea in which algae are found; but these passages clearly prove that by this the Hebrews designated the Red Sea. At what part of this sea the Israelites crossed, and the hosts of Pharaoh were submerged, is and must remain uncertain, because we know not what was the condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus. It is probable it was not at any part of what is now known as the Red Sea or Gulf of Suez. Brugsch Bey places it at that - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Serbonian bog<br />Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old,<br />Where armies whole have sunk."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Milton, 'Paradise Lost,'Bk. 2:592.</span>) But this has not been accepted by scholars generally (see <span class="accented">Edinburgh Review</span>, No. 307; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 247; <span class="accented">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, July and October, 1880). It seems probable that originally only a marshy district lay between the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean; and somewhere in this probably the passage of the Israelites and the drowning of the Egyptians occurred. <span class="cmt_word">Between Paran, and Tophel</span>, etc. This serves more fully and particularly to indicate the locality here intended; but the details present considerable difficulty. Taken in connection with the words "over against the lied <span class="accented">sea</span>," the names here given can only be regarded as intended more precisely to indicate the region in which the Israelites had been during the forty years of their wandering. <span class="accented">Paran</span>: this is the name of the wilderness bordering on Idumea, where the Israelites encamped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>); the place of their encampment being Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21, 26</a>), which was the eastern part of the wilderness of Paran. <span class="accented">hod</span>. Wady Murreh. The wilderness of Paran corresponds in general outline with the desert of Et-Tih. This is a vast plateau of irregular surface stretching from the Et-Tih range northwards to the boundaries of the Holy Land, and from the Gulf of Akabah and the Wady cf. Arabah on the east to the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean on the west. It is described as "a chalky formation, the chalk being covered with coarse gravel, mixed with black flints and drifting sand;" not, however, wholly sterile: in many parts vegetation abounds, considerable portions are under cultivation, and there are evidences that it one time water was abundant there (Smith, 2:767; Kitto, 3:1077; Drew, 'Scripture Lands,' p. 80). It is not, however, to the wilderness of Paran that the reference is in the text, but to some definite locality or spot in the region in which the Israelites then were, or which they had recently passed through. It has been suggested that the place now called Feiran, and where there are the ruins of a town, once of some importance in the early history of Christianity, is the Paran of this passage, as it apparently is the Paran of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>. But this locality at the base of Jebel Serbail is much too far west to be the Paran here referred to. More probable is the suggestion that it is the Faran mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome ('Onomast.,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>), a city to the cast (northeast) of Allah or Elath, about three days' journey (Reland, 'Palest.,' p. 556; Winer, 'Realworterbuch,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. Pharan). <span class="accented">Tophel</span>: this name occurs only here; it is supposed to be the place now coiled Tufailah or Tafyleh, a large village of six hundred inhabitants, between Bozrah and Kerak, on the eastern slope of the mountains of Edom (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 402; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 2:570). As this is a place where the Syrian caravans are supplied with provisions, it has been conjectured that the Israelites, when at Oboth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10, 11</a>), may have resorted to it for a supply, and that it was here that they purchased meat and drink from the children of Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Laban.</span> <span class="accented">Laban</span> is generally identified with Libnah, the second place of encampment of the Israelites on their return from Kadesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-20.htm">Numbers 33:20, 21</a>). Knobel, however, thinks it is the place called by Ptolemy '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, lying between Petra and Allah; this name, from the Arabic (he was white), having the same meaning as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Hazeroth</span> is supposed to be the place mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-35.htm">Numbers 11:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>, from which the Israelites entered the wilderness of Paran; but as the other places here mentioned are on the east side of the Arabah, it is not probable that this Hazeroth is the same as that of Numbers, which must have been not far from Sinai, in a northerly or north-westerly direction from that mountain, probably at or near to the fountain now called El Hudherah (Wilson, 'Lands of the Bible,' 1:235; Kitto, 'Cyclopedia,' 2:243). There were probably several places bearing the name of <span class="accented">Hazeroth</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. villages. <span class="cmt_word">Dizahab</span>. This is generally identified with Dhahab, a place on a tongue of land in the Gulf of Akabah. But it is extremely improbable that the Israelites ever were at this place, the approach to which is exceedingly difficult; and the mere resemblance of the names Dizahab and Dhahab is not sufficient to prove the identity of the places. There were probably more places than one which were named from <span class="accented">zahab</span> (gold) in the region traversed by the Israelites. There is a Dhahab on the east of the Jordan near the Zerka or Jabbok, a double mound, which is said to derive its name from the yellowish color of the sandstone rock of which it consists, and which is metalliferous. In the Arabic of the Polyglot, Dizahab appears as <span class="accented">Dhi-dhahab</span>, which signifies "<span class="accented">auro</span> <span class="accented">praeditum</span> vel <span class="accented">ab auro dictum</span>; <span class="accented">nam</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> vel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span>, apud Arabes in compositione nominum propr. idem est ac Hebrews <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> (J. H. Michaelis). There is a various reading here, <span class="accented">Di-waheb</span>, and this has been supposed to connect this place with the Waheb of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>. But, as above noted, it is by no means certain that Waheb is there the name of a place; it may, as Bishop Patrick suggests, be that of a man, some hero or chief, who was conquered in Sufah or in a storm. Waheb is a name among the Arabs. The maternal grandfather of Me-hammed had this name (Abul-Pharaj, 'Hist. Dynast.,' p. 161, edit. Pococke, Oxen., 1663); and the sect of the Wahabees take their name from Abdul Wahab, a fanatic who appeared about the beginning of last century. The words "between Paran and Tophel" have been taken to indicate' the termini of the wanderings; at the commencement of these the people were at Paran, and towards the close of them they were at Tophel. '"Looking from the steppes of Moab over the ground that the Israelites had traversed, Suph, where they first entered the desert of Arabia, would lie between Paran where the congregation arrived at the borders of Canaan toward the west, and Tophel where they first ended their desert wanderings thirty-seven years later on the east" (Keil). But this assumes that Paran here is the wilderness of Paran. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Moses spake to the people all the Lord had given him in commandment. Horeb was but eleven days distant from Kadesh-barnea. This was to remind them that their own bad conduct had occasioned their tedious wanderings; that they might the more readily understand the advantages of obedience. They must now go forward. Though God brings his people into trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried long enough. When God commands us to go forward in our Christian course, he sets the heavenly Canaan before us for our encouragement.</body></html>
