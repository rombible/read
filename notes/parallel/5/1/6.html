It is of an introductory character, and is occupied chiefly with a retrospective survey of the events that had occurred during the forty years of their wanderings. By this Moses reminded the people how God had fulfilled his promises to them, and at the same time, how they had by their rebellion drawn down on them his displeasure, which had caused their wanderings to be so much more protracted than they would otherwise have been. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - The Lord's command to depart from Horeb, and his promise to the people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord our God</span> <span class="accented">- Jehovah our God</span>. The use of this epithet implies the covenant union of Israel with Jehovah, and presupposes the existence of that covenant which was entered into at Sinai. <span class="cmt_word">In Horeb</span>. This was the starting-point, so to speak, of Israel's being as the special people of God - his <span class="accented">segullah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>), his special treasure. There he made himself known to them as Jehovah, the Eternal and Unchangeable, and entered into covenant with them; and there they received that Law, on the keeping of which depended their retention of the privileges to which they had been elected. At Horeb the Israelites had remained for about a year (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>. I and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11, 12</a>), and as the purpose for which they had been brought thither was answered, they were enjoined to move, not indeed by express command, but by the rising of the cloud from over the tabernacle, which was the signal of their march (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, etc.; Numbers 10:11-13), preceded by the instructions they had received preparatory to their removal (Numbers 50:4-7). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount.</span> The Israelites remained at Sinai from the third month of the first year to the twentieth day of the second year after they came out of Egypt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Moses spake to the people all the Lord had given him in commandment. Horeb was but eleven days distant from Kadesh-barnea. This was to remind them that their own bad conduct had occasioned their tedious wanderings; that they might the more readily understand the advantages of obedience. They must now go forward. Though God brings his people into trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried long enough. When God commands us to go forward in our Christian course, he sets the heavenly Canaan before us for our encouragement.</body></html>
