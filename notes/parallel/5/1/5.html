But the Hebrew word here employed occurs in two other places only, and in both is connected with <span class= "ital">writing. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm" title="If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>, "thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law <span class= "ital">very plainly</span>" (<span class= "ital">baer heteb, </span>in writing and in making good). Again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm" title="And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain on tables, that he may run that reads it.">Habakkuk 2:2</a>, "write the vision, and <span class= "ital">make it plain </span>upon tables." The etymological affinities of the word also suggest the idea of writing. It would seem, then, that at this period Moses began to throw the discourses and laws that he had delivered into a permanent form, arranging and writing them with the same motive which influenced the Apostle Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2Peter 1:15</a>), "Moreover, I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance."<p>In this discourse the history of Israel, from the time of their departure from Sinai, is briefly recapitulated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-29.htm" title="So we stayed in the valley over against Bethpeor.">Deuteronomy 3:29</a>), and with a short practical exhortation. This portion of history comprises three periods of the exodus: (1) <span class= "ital">The march from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea, </span>with the sending of the twelve spies and its results, related more at length in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.">Numbers 10:11</a>--end of Deuteronomy 14. The characteristic feature of this period is <span class= "ital">failure </span>on the part of both leaders and people to rise to their high calling. Moses (Numbers 11), Aaron and Miriam (Num. xii), Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-28.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.">Numbers 11:28</a>), the spies, who were also rulers (Deuteronomy 13, 14), and the people throughout, all in turn exhibit the defects of their character. In the end the enterprise is abandoned for the time. (2) <span class= "ital">The thirty seven and a half years that follow </span>are a period of disgrace, as appears by the absence of all note of time or place in the direct narrative between Numbers 14 and Numbers 20. Certain places are mentioned in Numbers 33 which must belong to this period, but nothing is recorded of them beyond the names. A single verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>), is all that is assignable to that period in this discourse of Moses. This long wandering was also a <span class= "ital">period of training and discipline. </span>(3) <span class= "ital">The fortieth year of the exodus, </span>in which the conquest of Sihon and Og was effected, and Israel reached the banks of Jordan. The sentence of death pronounced against their elder generation having been executed, a new life was now begun.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The locality is again described <span class="cmt_word">as beyond Jordan</span> (see on ver. 1), <span class="cmt_word">and in the land of Moab.</span> This designates the region elsewhere called <span class="accented">Arboth Moab -</span> the Plains of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>, etc.), the region on the east of the Jordan, opposite to Jericho, now known as the region of Kerak (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 377, etc.; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.," 2:569). <span class="cmt_word">Began</span>; rather <span class="accented">set himself to</span>. The Hebrew word signifies to undertake, to betake one's self to, and so to begin It is variously rendered in the Authorized Version (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-27.htm">Genesis 18:27</a>, "taken it upon me;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>, "was content," had made up his mind; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>, "it pleased;" 17:39,"assayed," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To declare</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. make clear, explain, expound (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>, "make plain "). The Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) signifies primarily to cut or dig, then to cut into, to grave, and then to cut or dig out so as to make evident, to declare, to make plain. What Moses set himself to do, then, was not to publish a new law, but to make plain to the people the Law already promulgated, to set forth clearly and pointedly what they were required by the Law to be and to do. This explains more fully the "spake" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) of ver. 3. This exposition of the Law was designed specially for the sake of those who, at the time the Law was first promulgated, either were not born or were incapable of understanding it (Grotius). The expression used by Moses plainly indicates that this book was not intended to furnish a second code of laws different from the former, but simply to explain and enforce what had before been enjoined. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Moses spake to the people all the Lord had given him in commandment. Horeb was but eleven days distant from Kadesh-barnea. This was to remind them that their own bad conduct had occasioned their tedious wanderings; that they might the more readily understand the advantages of obedience. They must now go forward. Though God brings his people into trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried long enough. When God commands us to go forward in our Christian course, he sets the heavenly Canaan before us for our encouragement.</body></html>
