As the spies presumed to investigate the route and order of the conquest, a matter of Divine guidance, so Moses presumed to alter the prescribed order for the miracle in Kadesh. Like transgressions incurred like penalties. The fault for which the people had suffered could not be overlooked in the leader. (See also Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/3-23.htm" title="And I sought the LORD at that time, saying,">Deuteronomy 3:23-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-49.htm" title="Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>.)

This parenthetical reference to himself was probably thrown in by Moses for the purpose of preparing for what he was about to say respecting Joshua, in whom the people were to find a leader after he himself was gone. It may be noted also that Moses distinguishes between the anger of the Lord against him, and the wrath which broke forth upon the people - a distinction which is aptly preserved in the Authorized Version by the words "was wroth" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span>) and "was angry" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of you</span>, <span class="accented">on accent of</span> you. The Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) comes from a root meaning to roll, and signifies primarily a turn in events, a circumstance, an occasion or reason. Moses reminds the Israelites that the misconduct of the people was what led to God's being angry also with him (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-7.htm">Numbers 20:7</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32, 33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-46 Moses reminds the Israelites of their march from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea, through that great and terrible wilderness. He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.</body></html>
