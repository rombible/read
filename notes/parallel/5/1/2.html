The route between Paran on the one side and the line from Tophel to Hazeroth on the other is still further defined as "a distance of eleven days' journey from Horeb in the direction of Mount Seir, reaching to Kadesh-barnea." The position of this last place is not yet determined with certainty. But the requirements of the text seem, upon the whole, to demand that it should be placed high up in the wilderness of Paran, not far from the border of the wilderness of Zin. It must be close to some passage out of the wilderness of Zin into the Negeb, or south of Judah.<p><span class= "bld">Kadesh-barnea.</span>--In the regular narrative of the exodus we read of the place to which the twelve spies returned as <span class= "ital">Kadesh </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm" title="And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.">Numbers 13:26</a>), and of the place at which the period of unrecorded wandering closed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>), in the first month of the fortieth year, as <span class= "ital">Kadesh. </span>The name Kadesh-barnea first appears in Moses' speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-8.htm" title="Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.">Numbers 32:8</a>), where he refers to the sending of the twelve spies. And with the exception of three places where the name is used in describing boundaries, Kadesh <span class= "ital">-harnea </span>is always found in speeches. This first chapter of Deuteronomy is the only one which contains the name both with and without the appendage <span class= "ital">-barnea, </span>which connects it with the wanderings of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm" title="Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>). Upon the whole, it seems most likely that only one place or district is intended by the name.<p>We have now obtained the following view of this first short introduction to the Book of Deuteronomy. It consists of words spoken (in the first instance) to all Israel on their march from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea. But the following verses show that the Law was further "declared" to Israel in the plains of Moab, at the close of the fortieth year of the exodus and of Moses' life. It does not seem possible for us to separate entirely what was spoken earlier from what was declared later. In several places we have the record of words spoken: for example, in this very chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm" title="And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm" title="And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-18.htm" title="And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.">Deuteronomy 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm" title="And I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give to us.">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-29.htm" title="Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.">Deuteronomy 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm" title="So I spoke to you; and you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm" title="(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, &c. And the very name Deuteronomy implies the repetition of a law previously given. Further, the exhortations contained in this book are all enforced by the immediate prospect of going over Jordan and entering the promised land. But when Israel marched from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea, it was with this very same prospect full in view. It does not appear, by what Moses "said" at that time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm" title="And I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give to us.">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>), that he had any thought of their turning away from the enterprise. But if so, what supposition is more natural than this--that he delivered the same kind of exhortations in the course of that earlier journey which he afterwards delivered in the plains of Moab? And although the distance is but eleven days' march, the Israelites spent something like three months on the way, and in waiting for the spies to return from Canaan.<p>We conclude, then, that the first two verses of Deuteronomy are an editorial introduction, stating that the substance of this book was first delivered to Israel by Moses between Sinai and Kadesh-barnea. The further introduction which follows (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;">Deuteronomy 1:3-5</a>) shows the words to have been re-delivered in the plains of Moab, and preserved in their later rather than their earlier form. But it is also possible that the two first verses of Deuteronomy are an introduction to the <span class= "ital">first </span>discourse above. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>.)<p>Is it possible to advance a step further, and conjecture with any degree of probability to what hand we owe the first two verses of the book? The expression "on the other side Jordan" (which some take to be a technical term) seems strictly to mean on the opposite side to the writer. The writer must also have been acquainted with the places mentioned (three of which are not named in the previous books); he could not have drawn his knowledge from the earlier part of the Pentateuch. And so entirely has the geography of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a> been lost by tradition, that all the Targums and Jewish commentators agree in spiritualising the passage, and say, "these are the words of reproof which Moses.spake to all Israel in respect of their behaviour at these various places." Laban points to their murmuring at the <span class= "ital">white </span>manna. Dizahab to the <span class= "ital">golden </span>calf, and so on. Even Rashi, usually a most literal commentator, says, "Moses has enumerated the places where they wrought provocation before the PLACE "--a Rabbinical name for Jehovah: for "the whole world is His place, though His place is more than the whole world." This introduction to Deuteronomy seems the work of one who had known the wilderness, and yet wrote from Palestine. Joshua, the next writer to Moses, and possibly also his amanuensis, may have prefixed it to the book. If he did not, it is wholly impossible to say who did.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Horeb</span>. The name generally given to Sinai in Deuteronomy (see introduction, &sect; 4). Sinai, however, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> of this book. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of mount Seir</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by the way that leads to Mount Seir; just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>, "the way of the Red sea" is the way that leads to that sea (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>). <span class="accented">Mount</span> is here, as often elsewhere, for <span class="accented">mountain range</span>. The mountain range here referred to seems to have been, not that on the east of the 'Arabah, but what is in vers. 6 and 19 called "the mountain of the Amorites," "the Seir by Hormah" of ver. 44, i e. the southern part of what was afterwards called the mountains of Judah. According to ver. 19, the Israelites, when they left Horeb, passed through the wilderness along the way that led to the mountains of the Amorites, and came to Kadesh-barnea. Kadesh must, therefore, be looked for, not on the eastern side of the 'Arabah, but somewhere in the wilderness of Zin. It has been identified with the place now known as 'Ain Kudes, near the northern extremity of Jebel Halal, and to the east of that hill; but this is far from being certain. Moses reminds the Israelites that the distance between Horeb and Kadesh is eleven days - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, about one hundred and sixty-five miles, the day's journey being reckoned at fifteen miles - not to give them a piece of information, but rather to suggest to them how, in consequence of rebellion, a journey which might have been so easily accomplished, had been protracted through many wearisome years. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Moses spake to the people all the Lord had given him in commandment. Horeb was but eleven days distant from Kadesh-barnea. This was to remind them that their own bad conduct had occasioned their tedious wanderings; that they might the more readily understand the advantages of obedience. They must now go forward. Though God brings his people into trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried long enough.
