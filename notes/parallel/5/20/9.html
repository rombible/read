We may suppose from mention of the "thousands" in the army--"the captain of their thousand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-18.htm" title="And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.">1Samuel 17:18</a>)--that the military divisions corresponded with the civil organization of the people so far as this, that the men of the same "thousand," according to Jethro's arrangement, would be brigaded together, and have one captain. If, as is also possible, the word "thousand" in military language signifies the contingent furnished by a "thousand" in Israel, irrespective of its number, it would remove many difficulties; for the whole thousand would very rarely be in the field together, and the contingent sent by a given "thousand" might consist of a very few men. If, therefore, the contingent of sixty "thousands" were to be described as 60,000, and the sixty companies were all cut up or annihilated, it might be reported as a slaughter of 60,000 men, while the lives actually lost would be nothing like so many.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The next thing the <span class="accented">shoterim</span> had to do was to appoint captains to head the people who were going to war.

The Lord was to be their only confidence. In these respects they were types of the Christian's warfare. Those unwilling to fight, must be sent away. The unwillingness might arise from a man's outward condition. God would not be served by men forced against their will. Thy people shall be willing, Ps 110:3. In running the Christian race, and fighting the good fight of faith, we must lay aside all that would make us unwilling. If a man's unwillingness rose from weakness and fear, he had leave to return from the war. The reason here given is, lest his brethren's heart fail as well as his heart. We must take heed that we fear not with the fear of them that are afraid, Isa 8:12.</body></html>
