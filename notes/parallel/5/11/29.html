The two mountains named stand opposite to each other, with a valley between, about two hundred yards broad at the widest part, in which stood the town of Shechem, now Nablus. They were selected for the purpose mentioned, doubtless, because of their relative position, and probably also because they stand in the center of the land both from north to south, and from east to west. It has been suggested that Ebal was appointed for the uttering of the curse, and Gerizim for the uttering of the blessing, because the former was barren and rugged, the latter fertile and smooth; but this is not borne out by the actual appearance of the two bills, both being equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation. That Gerizim was selected for the blessing because of its position on the south side of the valley "towards the region of light," while Ebal was appointed for the curse because it was on the north side, can be regarded only as an ingenious fancy. In ver. 30, the position of the two mountains is defined as <span class="cmt_word">on the other side of Jordan</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. on the side opposite to where the Israelites then were, the western side; and as <span class="cmt_word">by the way</span> - rather, <span class="accented">behind the way - <span class="cmt_word"></span>where the sun goeth down</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the road of the west, the great road which passed through the west-Jordan country, and which is still the main route from south to north in Palestine (Ritter, 4:293, etc.; Robinson, 3:127), passing Nablus and the two menu-rains on the east, so that they are <span class="accented">behind</span> it. <span class="cmt_word">Which dwell in the Champaign</span>; in the 'Arabah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>), "mentioned here as that portion of the land on the west of the Jordan which lay stretched out before the eyes of the Israelites, who were encamped in the steppes of Moab" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Over against Gilgal</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>, which was east of Jericho (<span class="accented">hod</span>.

Jiljilia), to the north of Bethel, from which there is "a very extensive prospect over the great lower plain, and also over the sea" (Robinson, 'Bib.

He charged the people to choose which they would have. Moses then appointed a public and solemn proclamation of the blessing and curse, to be made upon the two mountains of Gerizim and Ebal. We have broken the law, and are under its curse, without remedy from ourselves. In mercy, the gospel again sets before us a blessing and a curse. A blessing, if we obey the call to repentance, to faith in Christ, and newness of heart and life through him; an awful curse, if we neglect so great salvation. Let us thankfully welcome these glad tidings of great joy; and let us not harden our hearts, but hear this voice of God while it is called to-day, and while he invites us to come to him upon a mercy-seat. Let us be diligent to make our calling and election sure.</body></html>
