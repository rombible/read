One instance of the latter is expressly referred to - the destruction of those who joined in the insurrection of Korah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). Moses does not mention Korah himself here, but only his accomplices Dathan and Abiram, probably, as Keil suggests, "from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah;" perhaps also because, though Korah was at the head of the insurrection, Dathan and Abiram were the more determined, audacious, and obdurate in their rebellion (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12-15, 25, 26</a>), so that it came to be named from them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-7 Observe the connexion of these two; Thou shalt love the Lord, and keep his charge. Love will work in obedience, and that only is acceptable obedience which flows from a principle of love, 1Jo 5:3. Moses recounts some of the great and terrible works of God which their eyes had seen. What our eyes have seen, especially in our early days, should affect us, and make us better long afterwards.</body></html>
