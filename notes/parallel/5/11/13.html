There was no religious service for Israel in Babylon except prayer. The thought seems worth preserving, though the words are obviously capable of a wider application.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Being thus wholly dependent on God, it behooved them to be careful to attend to his commandments and to obey them, that so his blessing might be continued to them and to the laud. If they would love and serve the Lord as they were bound to do, he would give them the rain of their land, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. rain for their land, such as it required (cf. "rain of thy seed," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2, 3</a>), in the proper season, the early and the latter rain, so that they should fully enjoy the benefits of the land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:8-17 Moses sets before them, for the future, life and death, the blessing and the curse, according as they did or did not keep God's commandment. Sin tends to shorten the days of all men, and to shorten the days of a people's prosperity. God will bless them with an abundance of all good things, if they would love him and serve him. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is; but the favour of God shall put gladness into the heart, more than the increase of corn, and wine, and oil. Revolt from God to idols would certainly be their ruin. Take heed that your hearts be not deceived. All who forsake God to set their affection upon any creature, will find themselves wretchedly deceived, to their own destruction; and this will make it worse, that it was for want of taking heed.</body></html>
