In the command to honour thy father and mother, it is written (Deuteronomy 5) 'that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee.' In the liberty of the nest it is written (here), 'that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.' Suppose a man's father says to him, Climb up the tower and bring me the young birds. He ascends the tower, lets the dam go, and takes the young. But on his way back, he falls and is killed. Where is the 'going well 'in his case, and where is the prolonging of his days? Aye, but that it may go well with thee <span class= "ital">in the world where all goes well, </span>and that thy days may be prolonged in that <span class= "ital">world where all is abiding</span>."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-28.htm">Leviticus 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>.) These precepts are designed to foster humane feeling towards the lower animals, and not less to preserve regard to that affectionate relation between parents and their young which God has established as a law in the animal world. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest prolong thy days</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-16.htm">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:5-12 God's providence extends itself to the smallest affairs, and his precepts do so, that even in them we may be in the fear of the Lord, as we are under his eye and care. Yet the tendency of these laws, which seem little, is such, that being found among the things of God's law, they are to be accounted great things. If we would prove ourselves to be God's people, we must have respect to his will and to his glory, and not to the vain fashions of the world. Even in putting on our garments, as in eating or in drinking, all must be done with a serious regard to preserve our own and others' purity in heart and actions. Our eye should be single, our heart simple, and our behaviour all of a piece.</body></html>
