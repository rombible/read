The year's corn was freed by the wave-sheaf and wave-loaves. The trees not for five years. The rule about the ox and the ass may rest partly on the ground of humanity, the step and the pull of the two creatures being so very unlike.

The clean and unclean must not till the holy land of Jehovah together.<p>All these precepts are part of the laws of holiness in Leviticus--rules of behaviour arising from the fact that Israel is the special people of a holy God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>.) God has made distinctions in nature, and these are not to be confounded by the mixing of things distinct. The ox and the ass were chiefly used in husbandry; but, as they were of different size and strength, it was not only fitting that they should not be yoked to the same plough, but it might be cruel so to yoke them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:5-12 God's providence extends itself to the smallest affairs, and his precepts do so, that even in them we may be in the fear of the Lord, as we are under his eye and care. Yet the tendency of these laws, which seem little, is such, that being found among the things of God's law, they are to be accounted great things. If we would prove ourselves to be God's people, we must have respect to his will and to his glory, and not to the vain fashions of the world. Even in putting on our garments, as in eating or in drinking, all must be done with a serious regard to preserve our own and others' purity in heart and actions. Our eye should be single, our heart simple, and our behaviour all of a piece.</body></html>
