Jealousy and caprice on the part of the husbands, in view of this law, would be avoided as likely to incur discredit and serious penalties. A fine of 100 shekels (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-19.htm" title="And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.">Deuteronomy 22:19</a>), or 50 (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm" title="Then the man that lay with her shall give to the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), was no light matter for a nation who found a quarter shekel sufficient for a present to a great man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm" title="And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.">1Samuel 9:8</a>), and half a shekel too much for a poll-tax on the men of military age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?">1Chronicles 21:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-15.htm" title="The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering to the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.">Exodus 30:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-32.htm" title="Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;">Nehemiah 10:32</a>). The law of the jealousy offering in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/5-12.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,">Numbers 5:12-31</a>, must also be taken into consideration, as guarding the fidelity of the wife. It would be most unadvisable for either man or woman so to act as to bring themselves under the penalties here described. The tendency of these laws would be to make all men watchful and careful for the honour of their families.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">She hath wrought folly in Israel.</span>--This expression should be noticed. It appears for the first time in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a>, very shortly after the bestowal of the name <span class= "ital">Israel </span>(Genesis 32). It would almost appear that the name entailed a higher standard of behaviour upon Jacob's family, after the hand of the Holy One had been laid upon their father. A separate code of rules were binding upon the chosen people from the very beginning of their history. Hardly any point is made of more importance, from the birth of Isaac downwards, than the purity of the chosen seed.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">Adultery.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a>. "<span class= "ital">Moses </span>in the Law commanded us that such should be stoned." It was not disputed by our Saviour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-29.</span> - The laws in this section have the design of fostering purity and fidelity in the relation of the sexes, and also of protecting the female against the malice of sated lust and the violence of brutal lust. (For the case supposed in ver. 13, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-15.htm">2 Samuel 13:15</a>. On the whole section see Michaelis, 'Laws of Moses,' pt. 2. &sect; 92; Niebuhr, 'Description de l'Arabie,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8.htm">Deuteronomy 8</a>; Burckhardt, 'Bedwins,' p. 214.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:13-30 These and the like regulations might be needful then, and yet it is not necessary that we should curiously examine respecting them. The laws relate to the seventh commandment, laying a restraint upon fleshly lusts which war against the soul.</body></html>
